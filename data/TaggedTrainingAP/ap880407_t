 American <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops have lent moral support for Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>'s now-suspended offer to mediate talks between the Panamanian government and the opposition which has been trying to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. A letter of support from the American bishops to <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, was released on Thursday, just hours before <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> announced he was suspending the mediation effort. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said he was withdrawing his offer because: opposition groups refused to talk to the government until it showed a willingness to discuss <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure; <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had n't offered explicit backing of the initiative in writing; and there were no assurances that the four international leaders who proposed the talks could be present. Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, in the letter to <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, said: `` The voice of the church in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been clear and consistent, denouncing the instances of civic corruption and state violence that have tragically become so much a part of recent news reports.'' The letter was made public Thursday. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, the acting president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said his government agreed to talks mediated by the church. But the opposition insists on assurances that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is willing to step down and leave the country. `` I write to express our full support and ecclesial solidarity with you, your fellow bishops and all the suffering people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' May said in his letter to <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. He added that `` we continue to urge our own national leaders to exercise the greatest care in balancing pursuit of legitimate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in the region with the essential quest for a peaceful and just settlement of this crisis.'''

 The nation's only college croquet court plays host to its first intercollegiate tournament Friday with little fanfare and some embarrassment to <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> officials, says the professor who raised money for the field. `` I'm told that this event promotes the idea that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is elitist,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a literature professor emeritus at the 2,000-student school who was instrumental in getting the court built. `` If it were n't, they'd be out of business.'' Administrators at the private women's college denied any embarrassment about the 105-foot by 84-foot field. `` There might have been a few faculty snickers and comments made on why we would spend time and money building a croquet court when there are other more important things to do,'' said Director of Development <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Heartt </PERSON>. `` But it was no skin off our backs. It did n't cost us anything,'' she said. The $ 16,000 court was paid for by donations from alumnae interested in the sport. However, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the already jittery administrators were delivered an blow when New England Monthly magazine noted in its January issue that the `` mere $ 16,000'' spent on the `` elaborately irrigated'' court would nearly cover a year's tuition and room and board charges for a scholarship student. `` This is preposterous,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who has described croquet as a cross between billiards and chess. `` This is the one sport that is absolutely neutral in age and gender. It did n't even occur to me to add ` race.' `` And it's cheaper than golf by a whole lot.'' Concerns about the school's elitist image began with its recent racial problems. The first black woman to earn tenure at the college quit in December, saying <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was lethargic in combating racism. Two black administrators followed soon after. But the school argues that it has taken great pains to fight racism and attract minorities since a spray-painted slur appeared on the steps of a campus building in October 1986. A survey <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> commissioned found its image problem had more to do with elitism than racism. More than half the 788 students, staff and administrators polled said they had been victims of class discrimination, according to the survey released in November. One problem remaining for the croquet court is getting it dedicated. Ms. <PERSON> Heartt </PERSON> said the college had arranged for a ceremony April 23 before learning that the school's croquet team would be in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> for a tournament. And President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> will be out of town this weekend. `` We ca n't get a schedule clear that suits both me and the team,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman. In the English version that will be played this weekend among 40 competitors from nine of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> schools, from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION> to the universities of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, teams of two players each shepherd two balls twice around a wicketed turf. Friday's game at the Smith court, which means players no longer have to go 50 miles to a <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> hotel court, is the first of the season for the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croquet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can understand why the college is nervous,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NECCA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Xandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON>. `` They do n't have enough experience with college croquet to understand the good press it gets. But I can also understand <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, because croquet changed his life.'' Young, 66, lost one leg and suffered a crippling injury to his other foot during World War II. He had trouble moving and had given up on sports until he discovered croquet a few years ago. He organized the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> team and persuaded alumnae to donate the money for the court.

<TEXT>
 One of the thousands of small commuter buses that careen about <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> every day carries an appropriate bumper sticker: `` You never know, heaven could be nearer than home.'' Authorities say the overcrowded, poorly maintained, wildly driven buses called `` matatus'' have contributed heavily to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s highway death toll of nearly 200 so far this year At that rate, the toll is roughly on pace with 1987 when 1,889 people died in traffic accidents _ or one person killed for every 166 cars on <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s roads. A similar rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would mean that annual highway fatalities, now fewer than 50,000, would reach more than 1 million a year. The privately owned matatus carry such names as `` Survival of the Fittest'' and `` Living Devil.'' Scary as it all may be, the poor people who use them have no other choice. The brightly colored vehicles are legally allowed to carry no more than 25 passengers. But usually matatu crews cram in twice that many or more to get more fares. Those who ca n't fit inside climb onto the roof and cling to luggage as the buses go into a list on high-speed turns. Thirty-one people were killed Feb. 29 in a three-matatu crash that incensed a nation already accustomed to headlines screaming of `` horror smashes,'' and `` matatu madness.'' For days after the crash, newspapers printed pictures of victims strewn across the road and of the crumpled matatus. Commentaries called for something to be done about matatus, and a road-safety program was reintroduced on the government's Voice of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> television. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Matatu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> resigned rather, he said, than be `` cursed by the innocent blood of the commuters who die daily on our roads at the hands of reckless matatu drivers.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, whose government in 1984 passed the first legislation aimed at controlling matatus, decided they had become more `` an agent of death and destruction than an asset to the commuter.'' Police began a crackdown, netting hundreds of unroadworthy and overcrowded vehicles. Matatu crews, as well as unseated passengers, were hit with heavy fines. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> issued a new and more stringent list of regulations and ordered all matatu drivers retested. But the matatu industry retaliated with a strike that stranded hundreds of thousands of people. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> rescinded the retesting order, and the matatus returned after a day off the roads. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>'s response to the strike underscored the matatu industry's stranglehold on the nation's transportation sector Less than 1 percent of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s 22 million people own cars and fewer than 600 buses are on the roads. The lack of vehicles leaves a demand for transportation met by the tens of thousands of matatus, which mostly are vans and minibuses, that travel even the most rural routes. Matatus first appeared as pirate taxis in the mid-1950s when <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> was a British colony and movement by the native population was restricted. The industry burgeoned after independence in 1963 when restrictions were lifted and people were allowed to move to the cities, swelling metropolitan populations and increasing the need for public transport. The name matatu comes from the Kikuyu term `` mang ` otore matatus,'' meaning 30 Kenyan cents, which at that time was the standard matatu Today, the average fare around <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> is 3 shillings -LRB- 19 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents -RRB- and routes are flexible. To increase profits and their own $ 40 to $ 75 monthly salaries, matatu crews overload the buses, work overly long hours at the wheel and drive at high speeds in order to meet daily quotas set by matatu owners. At least 80 percent of the matatu crews work seven-day weeks and average 10 hours a day in vehicles that suffer most often from engine, brake or gear-box failure, according to a 1982 study by the Nairobi-based <ORGANIZATION> Mazengira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Many drivers admit to chewing khat, a stimulative twig, or smoking marijuana to keep themselves alert. In one of the dozens of commentaries on matatus, a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, blamed `` greed, brainless bravado and showmanship'' for the road carnage caused by matatus. `` The nation should not allow lunatics to ply the roads any longer,'' the columnist said.

 After a short-lived stint as a party animal, Bullwinkle the moose has come home to roost atop the pizza palace from which he was moosenapped seven months ago.

The restaurant, eager to get its $ 17,000 mascot back, offered the culprits free pizza for a year for the 300-pound moose on the loose. Suspicion soon focused on the notorious spy <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenov </PERSON> and his companion, <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON>. Finally, on April Fool's Day a deflated Bullwinkle was unceremoniously deposited in the parking lot of the eatery along with a 2-by-3-foot note. `` Hey guys! The moose is no longer loose. He wanted to party with us so we brought him along. It turns out he was too wild for us! Please keep an eye on him, he's dangerous! April Fools, Class of'88. `` P.S. Sorry.'' Police, who say the case is closed, believe the moose's abductors may have been students from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> High who decided to give back Bullwinkle after they realized what it was worth The restaurant manager, however, ca n't just laugh it off, having ordered a replacement moose for the roof.

 Amid the dusty debris of the bombed-out children's hospital were a stuffed <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> doll, a white plastic toy horse and a poster for children to learn English from pictures. The director of the <LOCATION> Bahrami </LOCATION> children's hospital in downtown <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said about 60 children were inside the building when an Iraqi missile blasted into it at about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday. `` All of us were working normally. There was no alarm,'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Tayayori </PERSON> told reporters. `` We have recovered eight bodies of children up to now,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter. `` Three are still missing and we fear they are buried under the debris.'' He said he could not give the number of injured as they had been moved to several other hospitals since. But a doctor at the hospital said about 20 children were seriously injured. <PERSON> Tahayori </PERSON> said there were about 60 children in the hospital at the time of the attack. Normally the hospital has about 250 patients, but most were evacuated when the shelling between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> flared anew Feb. 29. He said three nurses also were killed and 20 were seriously injured. The group of foreign reporters was led over a huge pile of debris that was once the kindergarten ward. In the street, a crowd stared at the visiting reporters. A bearded old man shouted frantically, `` Where is the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>? Is this human rights?'' His cries were translated by an interpreter. A young man who spoke English said he heard a `` terrible sound'' before the impact, then saw a huge cloud of smoke rising over the site. `` I was shocked.

 With the spiriting away of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> prison, three of four reputed drug barons sought in the killing of an American drug agent are behind bars. The Feb. 7, 1985 kidnapping of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, a special agent of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, put the spotlight on the immense power and wealth accumulated by drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The bodies of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON> were found March 5, 1985. <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON> was a Mexican pilot who worked with <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> in anti-narcotics programs from their base in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. During the hunt for <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and then for his killers, an outline of a powerful drug organization became clear. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials called the organization <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Familia </ORGANIZATION> _ the Family. Talk of Mexican cooperation in anti-drug programs was replaced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by charges of widespread corruption. The narcotics issue has remained a major sticking point in U.S.-Mexican relations. The four top men in the illicit drug trade were said to be Ernesto `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Neto </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>, reportedly the organization's leader; <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> is a Honduran citizen and the others are Mexican. Although they were not all accused of direct participation, their organization that was believed responsible for ordering <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s murder. `` These people were all involved in a drug trafficking organization,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> were taken into custody in spring 1985 and remain imprisoned, charged in <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s murder. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was picked up Tuesday in a pre-dawn helicopter police raid at his home in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the Honduran capital, and put on a flight out of the country without a passport. Honduran legislators angrily called the incident a `` kidnapping'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> started an investigation of the procedures used. The exploits of <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> in particular, his rise from poverty to vast wealth, have given him almost a folk hero status in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Two escape tunnels were discovered last fall near his prison, one almost complete. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> remains at large. No warrant has been issued for him in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Reports surface from time to time that he dined with a governor or made some other public appearace. `` There are more than 50 people imprisoned,'' <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal attorney general's office, said Wednesday when asked for a status report on the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> count is 63 people in custody in the case, a small number of them sentenced. `` We expect the Mexican judicial system to find these people guilty. We expect convictions, given the overwhelming evidence against them,'' <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said. In January, a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> indicted nine people, including <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, on charges stemming from the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> kidnap and murder. The attorney general's office said: `` The respective trials will continue to develop before the Mexican jurisdictional bodies, independent of whatever procedure is opened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or in third countries.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said in a February interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that recriminations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over which one is lagging in the drug trade war are not in the interest of either country. `` We find it difficult to accept the opinion held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of what really goes on in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The border is not a border between black and white, good and evil. It is a border between countries.''

 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, known worldwide for making fine cigars, will participate in an international stop-smoking day. The Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> participation today should not be considered `` a novelty,'' even though <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is a major tobacco producer. `` A strong campaign against the smoking habit has been under way for some years and has achieved already positive results, even though at the expense of an important reduction in income from the sale of cigarettes and tobacco,'' said the dispatch received in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The campaign intensified after <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> gave up his trademark cigars about two years ago. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said per capita consumption of cigarettes and tobacco has been declining since 1986 and sales dropped by $ 100 million last year. It also said from today onward smoking will be banned on all Cuban domestic flights.

<HEAD>Teacher With AIDS Continues Work While Fighting Illness</HEAD>

 A teacher who won a landmark court decision allowing him to continue teaching despite suffering from AIDS says his life has almost returned to normal even though his body is weakening. `` There are some days that I think nothing is wrong, and there are other times when I know very well something is, uh, lurking in my body,'' <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalk </PERSON> said in an interview published Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilot </ORGANIZATION>. Chalk, a vocational counselor for hearing-impaired students at <ORGANIZATION> Venado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, filed a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> last year when officials reassigned him to a desk job after learning he had AIDS. In November, the 9th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in what is believed to have been the nation's first such AIDS discrimination case, saying he could not be barred from the classroom. Chalk, 43, said he never anticipated the publicity the case generated, which forced his parents to tell their friends that their only son was homosexual, something they had known for years. Chalk said he felt sorry for himself at first. `` I'm not nor ever have been a very sexually active kind of person,'' said Chalk, who lives in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> with a companion of six years. `` I thought, ` Other people are out there doing a lot more than I am. They would make better subjects.' But you ca n't go through life dealing with ` Why me's?''' But now, he's motivated to remain in the classroom, although he weighs 130 pounds, down from 160, and is plagued by a chronic sinus infection, he said. Chalk has trimmed his work week to three days so he wo n't weaken. `` There are people who want to say, ` See? Knew you could n't do it,''' he said. Chalk said he listens to motivational tapes and uses visual imagery in fighting AIDS, and has given up casual cocaine use and alcohol. `` I'm trying to create as much health in my life and my body as possible,'' he said.

 A civil court will hear the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s complaints that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> illegally ousted him from his teaching post as a result of <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> displeasure with his theology. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, a prominent professor of theology, is suing the university for breach of contract. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaudin </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected the university's claim that <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s suspension was under church law and therefore is immune to civil court review. `` This court finds the university's position without merit,'' <PERSON> Beaudin </PERSON> said in a written order denying a motion by the university for dismissal of the suit. `` Professor <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s claim is based on an employment contract governed by the civil law and contract principles of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Beaudin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the university, said `` we do n't comment on ongoing litigation. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, in 1986, declared <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> unfit to teach as a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theologian because of his dissenting views on sexual issues. He had expressed the view that contraception and sterilization `` are not intrinsically evil,'' and that `` in certain circumstances,'' the church should allow divorce. He has also said that for a `` genuine homosexual, homosexual acts in the context of a loving relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be objectively and morally acceptable.'' Archbishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, the ex-officio chancellor of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, suspended <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> from all teaching at the university last January. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, who now teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, challenged the suspension in court as a breach of university bylaws and his contract. The school asked dismissal of the suit, principally on the ground that court interference in canon law is barred by the freedom of religion clause in the Constitution. <PERSON> Beaudine </PERSON> said he did not dispute the school's contention that the court lacks authority `` to review and examine the university's interpretation and application of canon law'' and that his ruling applied only to <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s academic tenure and employment contract In a statement released by his lawyers, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said he is not asking the church `` to do or change anything in its decision concerning me. I am asking the court to ensure that a civilly incorporated university follow its own bylaws and its contract with me.''

<HEAD>Quarantine Ordered To Stop Spread Of Bee Mite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ordered an immediate quarantine for 13 states to help prevent the further spread of a tiny killer mite that threatens the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bee industry. The restrictions, announced Wednesday, ban the shipment from those states of bees and apiary equipment, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, acting associate administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. States affected by the quarantine are: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Of the major honey producing states, only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> so far remain unaffected by the mites, whose scientific name is <PERSON> Varroa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsoni </PERSON>. The female is about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, and the male is somewhat smaller. The mites were discovered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last September in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> apiary and since have spread to the 12 other states. `` Varroa mites can be spread by the movement of queen bees, package bees, hives, pollen, honeycomb with brood cells, and apiary equipment and vehicles,'' <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. `` Under our regulations, these articles will be prohibited from moving interstate from quarantined areas unless certain conditions are met.'' The female Varroa mite lays 3 to 20 eggs in the protective comb cell of a developing bee. Young mites emerge and suck the blood of the bee larvae, killing or causing them to be deformed and useless to the hive _ in which case they are killed by the worker bees. If agency inspectors determine that there is no risk of mites, they can issue certificates allowing the movement of articles out of the quarantined states, <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. In other cases, a `` limited permit'' may be issued to move articles that do not pose a pest risk, provided that additional precautions are taken. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said the quarantine order `` will help protect our beekeeping industry as well as the estimated $ 20 billion worth of agricultural crops pollinated by bees each year.'' The external parasites can infest bees and their developing larvae so gradually that the mites are unnoticed until serious damage is done. The damage includes decreased broods, deformed bees and a weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants and produce honey. <PERSON> Caree </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, an agency spokeswoman, said no termination date for the quarantine was set and that she had no idea when the restrictions might be lifted. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in January approved the use of a chemical, fluvalinate, in the fumigation of bees and hives for mites, she said. A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Zoecon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, manufactures a plastic strip under the commercial name Apistan, which contains fluvalinate. Ms. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said the strips can be used to fumigate bees and hives, with the supers or honey collectors removed first, in order to be certified as free of mites. But as for a general breakthrough in the prevention or rapid eradication of <LOCATION> Varroa </LOCATION> mites, she said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists are still looking. After the mites were detected last year, some experts speculated that the pests might have come into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as much as two or three years before. But no one knows for sure. Some authorities said the <LOCATION> Varroa </LOCATION> mite orginated in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> where it coexisted with Asian honeybees. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bees are of European origin and are highly vulnerable to the pests.

 Cattle tick fever is being targeted by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists in a new experiment this year on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Millions of sterile male cattle ticks will be released on a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> test site to see whether the procedure can be used to control cattle fever, officials said Wednesday. `` We hope sterile -LRB- male -RRB- releases will stop female ticks from producing new generations that would infest cattle,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, an entomologist in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Island people are safe from the disease. Humans are not bitten by the tick, nor do they get the disease.'' Cattle fever, or babesiosis, kills up to 80 percent of the adult cattle that get the disease, he said. The experiment will be tried for the first time `` late this year'' on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. Cattle fever is widespread in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and many other areas, he said. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, who works at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Cattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, Mission, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said cattle become anemic after the ticks bite them and injects a protozoan parasite into the bloodstream. Cattle ticks `` periodically sneak over the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> border into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' where a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> eradication program stops them from spreading beyond a buffer zone, he said. `` These ticks are tough,'' <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said in a statement issued here. `` If they were to get a strong hold again in the southern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the disease could devastate the southern cattle industry. All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle breeds are susceptible.'' The sterile male ticks are hybrids, which produce no offspring when they mate. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said the test will be on 130 wooded acres <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has leased from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government. No cattle are in the area now, so <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> expects there are few ticks. As part of the preparation, however, cattle will be put into the wooded area along with some naturally fertile ticks. After those ticks settle in, their numbers will be estimated. Then, <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> explained, about five hybrid ticks for each estimated natural tick will be released at two-month intervals. Until a count is made of the natural ticks, no estimate is available of how many sterile hybrids will be released, but the number could be in the hundreds of millions or even billions.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s men are dropping hints that the president is ready to hit the campaign trail on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf after a hoped-for triumphal return from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit Yet no matter when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> makes his choice known, his involvement in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign must walk a careful line. It's possible <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s involvement could overshadow rather than enhance the vice president's effort `` The president will help the vice president in any way, shape or form,'' predicted <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former political adviser. `` But it's got to be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... who lays out the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agenda.'' `` We'd love to see <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s strength is his personality and that's not <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strength On the stump, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would make <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> look weak.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been meticulous about maintaining an official neutrality. Now that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nearly racked up enough delegates to be the nominee, the White House has given notice <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is itching to take a more active role. `` He's ready at the drop of a hat to get out there on the road,'' spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> announced last week. Taking note of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s string of primary and caucus victories, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he wanted to raise the possibility that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will abandon his pledge to campaign only after a nominee had been chosen at the Aug. 15-18 GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I think that in view of the way the campaign has developed ... we could see the president involved in some political activities before the nominating convention, activities that are directly associated with the nominee,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But another <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, speaking privately, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> realizes he will be a target in the campaign and he will not make a step until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asks him. `` Clearly a lot of dialogue this fall will focus on us, with the Democrats attacking our record and the vice president supporting it,'' the official said. `` Anything we do will be carefully coordinated with the vice president.'' White House political director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> refused to speculate on what form <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s activities might take. But he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will not take part in any `` active campaigning'' until after the summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The meeting is scheduled for the second week of June. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, who most recently worked on <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s failed bid to win the nomination, said that will be `` the perfect time'' for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to designate his successor. `` He'll come back riding high in the polls; he'll be as popular as he's ever been,'' said <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> warned that the stature of the presidency could work against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as well as help him. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs to put his own stamp on his campaign,'' <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the one who gets into the debate with the Democrats in the fall, he could overshadow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Both <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> contend that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s involvement will help focus, not fuzz, the Republican nominee's message. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might not be able to determine the future, but he can define the present, and that's an important contribution to make to the dialogue,'' <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said, pointing out that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has referred repeatedly to the strength of the economy and low unemployment. But <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> warned that some favorite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> topics might well be avoided. `` If the two of them go out and talk about the line-item veto and the economic bill of rights, they'll bore everybody to death,'' he said. And other issues, such as the Iran-Contra affair and <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal difficulties, are likely to be ignored. `` If he spends the next months talking defending everything he's done and anybody who's ever worked for him, he wo n't be effective,'' <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> It is just such issues that will attract voters to the Democratic side, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. He argued that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters want a change and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must present himself as something different from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` But when the president goes out for him, it clouds <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the ` Great Communicator,' not <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat said. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> also argued that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach to dealing with the Soviets is one that is `` personally identified'' with the president and that it has `` never transferred to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s resume is supposedly grounded on foreign policy as his forte and he has n't shown that in eight years,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> also pointed out that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed when he attempted in the 1986 campaign to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hands. Although the president campaigned for months, the Republicans lost eight seats. `` We'd encourage such participation again,'' he added with a laugh.

 Glasnost has brought challenges for the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government radio station reviled for years by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>: Now that the Soviets have stopped jamming its broadcasts, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> has to be more interesting. `` We now use more actualities and music,'' <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said in an interview. And instead of recycling programs several times a day to go through despite jamming, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> now produces fresh material for every program. `` We now have to be more competitive,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said, citing broadcasts of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the more-open <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media under the glasnost _ or openness _ policies of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We have tried to make our programming more interesting, now that people do n't have to listen through eight frequencies'' of interference. But the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> has n't softened its view of Soviet affairs. Editorials try to put <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms `` within a realistic context,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` Like jamming. It is intellectually difficult to applaud people for stopping what they were not supposed to be doing in the first place. `` One of the things that we have not changed is the tone and tenor of our broadcasting. We are not being kinder to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. We think we have been fair all along.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> last December returned from a 10-day tour of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the first ever by a <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> director. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> which administers <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, also has traveled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. And the head of <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> service, <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Demming </PERSON>, is just back from a trip that took him to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> a week before demonstrations broke out there in February. After they left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Demming </PERSON> and a colleague, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> correspondent <PERSON> Joylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Naegle </PERSON>, telephoned contacts they made in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and broadcast reports on the demonstrations there. Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has opened some doors to <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, he still voices the longtime Soviet complaint about `` foreign voices'' fomenting unrest. `` ` Various radio stations, including official ones, have joined in the subversive activity,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Especially active ... is <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welle </ORGANIZATION>,'' West German radio. `` They are trying to interfere in our internal affairs, to exacerbate problems from the outside, and engaging in provocations,'' he said in remarks distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` At present this is particularly visible in connection with the events around <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>,'' a scene of Armenian unrest. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said he hopes that <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ire will not torpedo <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s longstanding request to open a bureau in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` In keeping with all the remarkably successful public relations moves by the Soviets, we think we may win approval,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. Later this month, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> is planning its first call-in show, in which broadcasters will field questions relayed from Soviet listeners dialing direct to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. And on Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> conducted its first telephone interview with a Soviet official, <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Morozov </PERSON>, director of the department of scientific research at the <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morozov </PERSON>'s boss, <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> <PERSON> Vartanian </PERSON>, for years has denied allegations that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> incarcerated dissidents in psychiatric hospitals. During the interview, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morozov </PERSON> repeated the Soviet denials, but acknowledged that some people sentenced for criminal offenses were treated in psychiatric hospitals. Soviet authorities treat political dissidents with debilitating drugs in psychiatric hospitals, according to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Numerous Soviet emigre accounts also have described the practice. `` We have a list of more than 100 people'' who were convicted of political crimes and sent to psychiatric hospitals, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> would combine <PERSON> Morozov </PERSON>'s comments with those of <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> and a Moscow-based dissident during a broadcast to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next week. Previously, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> has spoken by phone with dissidents such as <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, but never with an official. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> jammed <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts until 1973, when a period of Soviet-American detente began. Jamming resumed in 1980 with the rise of the independent Solidarity trade union in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The Soviets stopped jamming broadcasts to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last May 26, and stopped interfering with broadcasts to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this January. Polish-language broadcasts had been jammed by military transmitters inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. Although the Soviets have stopped jamming broadcasts by <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welle </ORGANIZATION>, they still try to block reception of two other U.S.-funded stations, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. To reach different groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts in a number of languages including Russian, Ukrainian, <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azeri </LOCATION>, Lithuanian, Estonian, Latvian, Armenian and Georgian. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> transmissions to other countries in the Soviet bloc include broadcasts in Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Romanian and German.

 A non-profit housing group says its new poll shows that people are willing to pay higher taxes to ensure that poor and middle-class Americans get decent, affordable housing. `` There's no doubt the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people support programs to expand home ownership, help low-income renters and aid the homeless,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` And contrary to the conventional wisdom, they're willing to pay. The poll found that most Americans believe there is a lack of affordable housing for the poor and middle class. Most of those surveyed said they would pay an extra $ 10 to $ 15 a month in taxes for programs to aid the homeless, the elderly and middle-class families unable to make down payments to buy houses. The survey also found that nearly 75 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public believes a presidential candidate who advocates housing programs for middle-and working-class families `` understands the real needs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The vast majority _ 86 percent _ said they feel homelessness is `` a national disgrace'' and an even higher percentage _ 93 percent _ said homelessness is an important problem that should be eliminated. `` Politically, a presidential candidate who guarantees every American a decent affordable home might have a new home himself _ on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON> said. The report, `` A Status Report On The American Dream: How the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Problems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>,'' was based on polling by <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The firm interviewed 1,001 adults by telephone during February and March. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, spokesman for the polling firm, said the margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. In general, the survey found that at least two-thirds of those questioned support programs to finance renovations in housing for the elderly, to rehabilitate old and vacant buildings, to establish a homeless prevention program to help those close to eviction for financial reasons, and to begin a mortgage assistance program to help with downpayments. On the issue of higher taxes to support housing programs, 66 percent said they would be willing to spend $ 10 a month more, while 55 percent said they would agree to pay $ 15 a month more. The poll also found that half of those surveyed said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports `` a package of housing programs,'' while only 6 percent said they would be less likely to support such a candidate. Seventy-four percent said they believe a presidential candidate who advocates housing programs for middle - and working-class families `` understands the real needs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are increasingly aware that this nation faces a housing problem,'' <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON> said. `` Our poll shows that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> understand that it's hard to find affordable housing and that Americans are shocked at homelessness.'' He said the housing institute, which describes itself as a representative of housing interests for moderate - and low-income families, can not lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for housing programs because of its non-profit status It does plan to provide its poll data to other groups that can promote the programs. <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON> said spending authority for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> dropped 57 percent from 1980 to 1987, from $ 35.7 billion a year to $ 15.2 billion. And he said that the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> budget last year represented 1 percent of the federal budget.

<HEAD>Only Half Of Adults Use Their Computers, Survey Says</HEAD>

 Only about half the adults who have a computer at home actually use it as opposed to nearly three-quarters of all children, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports. Youngsters use computers for learning and for games, and many children are also exposed to the machines in school, said bureau statistician <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON>, whose survey was released Wednesday. Even though many adults use computers at work, the home computer may have been bought by one adult for a specific use, and not be of interest to others in the home, <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON> suggested. In addition, many computers were bought `` as learning tools and game machines for children,'' he said. `` So there probably are quite a few situations in households where children use a computer and not the adults at all.'' The report was based on a survey taken in October 1984, the only time the bureau has looked at computer use. The report was delayed because of other priorities, he said. Computer use has skyrocketed from the nearly 7 million home computers in use at the time of the survey. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Boston-based market research group, estimates that the number of homes with computers reached nearly 16.5 million as of last year. And <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, estimates the total at 17.6 million homes as of January. While it deals with a time when fewer machines were in use, the census analysis is the first detailed look at who owns and uses the machines. Of 221 million Americans aged 3 and over in 1984, more than one in five _ 21.1 percent _ reported using computers in some direct way. _ Some 8.2 percent of households -LRB- 6.9 million -RRB- owned a home computer Ownership was most likely in households with incomes of $ 50,000 or more, 22.9 percent. Only 1.7 percent of households with incomes under $ 10,000 had a computer. People aged 34 to 44 were most likely to own computers. Those with children were three times more likely to have a machine than were the childless. _ Of the 15 million adults in computer households, 53.3 percent reported using the machine Use by men was 63.1 percent, compared to 48.2 percent of women. Usage was highest in the 25 to 34 age group. Adults in the West and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> were most likely to have a computer at home, 10.3 percent and 10.2 percent respectively. But westerners were much more likely to use them, 57.9 percent to 49.8 percent. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 8.9 percent of adults had a home computer and 54.5 percent of them used it. The rates were 7.7 percent of adults in the South with a computer and 51.6 percent using it. _ Nearly one-fourth, 24.6 percent of all employed adults, used a computer at work Reversing the home pattern, women were more likely to use them there, 29.0 percent to 21.2 percent. The highest rate of use was 39.1 percent of women in technical and support jobs, while the top rate for men was 38.6 percent in administrative and management positions. _ Among children aged 3 to 17, 15.3 percent had a computer at home, and 74.2 percent of those used it Of those enrolled in school, 28 percent reported using computers. Among youngsters, the study found, boys generally use computers more than girls. `` If you want to risk saying anything is a sociocultural difference at this time, that's certainly where it lies,'' <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON> said. `` People who study computer games find boys use these things much more than girls do, they go to video parlors more, and they use computers more at home and school too.'' In school, the highest usage was in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> where 33.9 percent of students said they had computers. The rate was 30.8 percent in the Northeast, 29.4 percent in the West and 21.3 percent in the South.

 Three years ago, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> set up a card table on a downtown street corner here to preach the benefits of long-distance telephone competition and sign up customers for a company called <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>. The 32-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> entrepreneur returned to that street corner Wednesday to tell customers, shareholders and anyone else who would listen that the company, now called <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is plagued by billing and management problems that are costing millions in lost business. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, who says he signed up more than 600,000 residential customers for <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, has been waging an unusual grass-roots campaign to oust the company's management and install himself as president to clean house. `` I'm appealing to customers and shareholders not to rely on the present management to correct the problems,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said in an interview before a speech to a curious lunchtime crowd outside the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. `` Management has been totally unresponsive'' to the problems, which <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> says cost him millions in lost commissions for his sales efforts as well as millions in lost business for the company. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier, has acknowledged its billing problems and admitted that bad debt has contributed to the company's losses. Spokesman <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Courson </PERSON> said the firm plans to have new computer software installed by January to take care of the problem. `` We've owned up to our billing problems and we've done a lot to correct them,'' <PERSON> Courson </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> has become a `` nuisance.'' Last week, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> took his entourage _ complete with a large campaign banner _ to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. This week he touched down in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> before arriving in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. All this is leading up to `` election'' appeals he hopes to make personally to shareholders at meetings April 12 for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and April 20 for <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint was formed as a joint venture by those two companies in July 1986. But he faces one big stumbling block: Shareholders do not elect the president. Shareholders, however, can raise issues like his at annual meetings, and since he owns <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> stock, he can make comments at that meeting. `` But since there is no election, I do n't know what his purpose is,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> is not a GTE shareholder. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> worked as an independent sales contractor for <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1986. During that period, the former high school teacher hired a sales force of about 400 young people who worked street corners and college campuses across the country, signing up new customers. But many of those they signed up never got service, were billed for calls never made, never received bills from <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> but were contacted by collection agencies or had other problems with service, he said. For <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, this meant problems receiving his commissions. He was supposed to be credited when customers made their first <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint calls. But because of problems installing service and billing customers, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> estimated that about half his recruits were never counted for a commission. After his contract with <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> was ended in September 1986, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> wrote scores of letters to <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> executives about his lost commissions and the company's billing problems. At the time, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said, the company owed him between $ 3 million and $ 8 million in unpaid commissions. He eventually settled for nearly $ 2 million, including a $ 1.7 million payment in January. In total, he said he received about $ 6 million from <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> during his 2 -LCB- years of recruiting. He said he paid close to $ 5 million of that to his young workers. But <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> says it is not the money that is driving his campaign to oust <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON>. `` My integrity is at stake,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said. `` I wanted to make more money and feel good about it at the same time.''

 They were together at the discovery of the North Pole in 1909. But in death, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> was in a shared grave in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> while Adm. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was honored at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> was black, and for that reason, said supporter Dr. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON>, `` he was denied proper recognition because of the racial attitudes of his time.'' On Wednesday, 79 years to the day after <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> planted the American flag on the North Pole, the two explorers were reunited as <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s remains and those of his wife were reinterred with full military honors at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. `` Now, finally, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> can talk about old days out there,'' a part-Eskimo grandson, <PERSON> Qitdlaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Qaanaaq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, said through a translator _ his cousin <PERSON> Navarana </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> _ at a news conference following the ceremony. `` I have waited for this day for over 30 years,'' <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s great niece, <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, told the gathering of about 100 relatives and admirers at the windswept hilltop burial site. Recalling that she was expelled from school because she had written a paper about <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> when her assignment had been to write about a hero, Ms. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said: `` Finally, my uncle is given his place in history.'' Counter said the reinterment of <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, was `` long overdue recognition for our hero ... -LRB- that would -RRB- right a tragic wrong.'' `` Welcome home, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Welcome home to a new day in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... May your presence here inspire generations of explorers.'' Last October, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved Counter's petition to allow <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s remains to be reinterred at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. He had been buried in 1955 in <LOCATION> Woodlawn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Among those honoring <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> at the ceremony were Gen. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckton </PERSON> of the White House military office, who conveyed greetings from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes Ebony and Jet magazines; Col. <PERSON> Guion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluford </PERSON>, the first black astronaut; and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Height </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. Counter, an associate professor of neurophysiology at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who previously had brought together <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s part-Eskimo offspring, said <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had insisted before his own death in 1920 that <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s achievements be recognized Descendants of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> were joined at the ceremony by <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s part-Eskimo descendants. `` This is a very special day for them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said at the news conference, translating for another of <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s grandsons, <PERSON> Ajako </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morriussaq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. `` They do n't even know how to express that.'' <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s eldest part-Eskimo grandson, <PERSON> Avataq </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Morriussaq </LOCATION>, clutched to his chest the flag that had draped his grandfather's coffin. `` When he visited <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s grave the first time in <LOCATION> Woodlawn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he expected it to be a hero's gravesite,'' Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said as she translated for Avataq `` He was disappointed to see him among ordinary people.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign treasury is filled to the brim and campaign officials say the biggest worry now is guarding against spending more than the $ 27 million pre-convention limit set by federal election law. The vice president's campaign has already spent all but $ 4 million of that cap, with more than four months yet to go to the Republican convention this August, said campaign treasurer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign hit the contribution limit on Wednesday, reporting that it had raised a total of $ 30 million, including $ 22.5 million in direct contributions and commitments for another $ 7.5 million in federal matching funds. This total includes about $ 3 million earmarked for legal and accounting expenses which are exempt from the $ 27 million-limit. `` The challenge is to take that $ 4 million we have left and maximize it so that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gets the best benefit out of that he can,'' said the campaign official, who is not related to candidate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I'm thrilled,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview. `` As far as this process is concerned, we're finished.'' The cap applies to both raising funds and spending them. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contender <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was the first candidate to actually bump up against the spending ceiling. The former televison evangelist said after the costly Super Tuesday contests on March 8 that he was within $ 2 million of the spending cap. Since then he has laid off staff and dropped an extensive television marketing operation. Though he has only 17 delegates to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 888, he remains in the race and is spending the rest of his money primarily on personal travel. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said staying within the limits is far easier because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is now running virtually unopposed among Republicans. `` It's a fait accompli as far as the nomination. You do n't have to go on advertising, you do n't have to buy more TV ads, you do n't have to have a huge entourage,'' he said The vice president had already scaled down his campaign schedule in the aftermath of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s withdrawal last week from the race. The vice president plans to go ahead with fund-raising events scheduled for this weekend in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, next week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and later in the month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The reason? <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the campaign is still entitled to raise another $ 2.8 million to go into a `` compliance fund,'' money needed for complying with various provisions enforced by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He said the campaign will still continue to raise funds until that $ 2.8 million has been met, and then will close up its fund-raising operation. Funds for the general election campaign are provided from tax dollars and from a `` presidential trust'' _ funds that can be raised and spent by the national parties on behalf of their nominees. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said contributors who have written checks to the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign that have n't yet been cashed soon will be receiving letters. `` We will write those people and explain to them that we are over the legal maximum, and would they allow us to use that check for the compliance fund. We have to have their signature. Otherwise, we will have to return the check.'' `` I think it will be a pretty easy $ 2.8 million to raise,'' he added.

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders are looking to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and asking if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can extend his winning streak to four _ and finally give the party a presidential front-runner. While many Democrats were sounding optimistic about the prospects of a breakthrough in the long, roller-coaster race, they also were painfully aware of the many occasions one or another candidate looked on the verge of claiming the title of front-runner. `` Every time we get a front-runner, it seems folks want to slow it down,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a former national party chairman who is advising <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Watching most closely are those elected and party officials _ 645 strong _ designated as uncommitted delegates to the Democratic National Convention, the so-called super delegates expected to hold the balance of power. `` The super delegates are looking for a candidate who can rattle off a big string of wins,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democratic Party chairman. It was in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses in March 26 that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trounced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and surged to the forefront of the contest, raising talk of the likelihood of a brokered convention. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> came shortly after a Dukakis loss in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. But since then, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has scored victories in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and now is favored to extend his streak in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> which holds its primary on April 19. `` The nominee will be determined in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we have a two-person race and we have a front-runner. The likelihood is we'll have a nominee and not a brokered convention.'' The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> vote `` gives a little boost to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Crangle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Democratic chairman, and one of the party's super delegates. `` But you've got to put a qualifying clause there that you've got to have a pattern, you've got to go two or three states in a row in order to say that you're a front-runner.'' Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> predicted the Democrats would choose their nominee on the first ballot of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention and he vowed to oppose any effort to organize a stop-Jackson movement. `` There's not going to be any organized cabal of party leaders trying to hobble one candidate as opposed to another,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. A total of 2,082 delegates is needed for a convention majority. To reach that number, either <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would need to win more than 1,300 of the 1,600-plus committed delegates yet to be chosen or draw strong support from the super delegates. `` The super delegates are going to stay frozen for a while,'' predicted White. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said the super delegates were `` looking for a candidate who can rattle off a big string of wins.'' He said most of those delegates accept the view that `` if there is a clear leader after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -LRB- the last two big states to hold primaries -RRB-, that super delegates ought to play a leading role in propelling that person over the top. At three in a row, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has gotten a very good start on that.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Prosecution Plan For Release Of Documents Too
Cumbersome</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge in the Iran-Contra case says he wants to streamline procedures for pre-trial disclosure of 150,000 pages of classified documents to the four defendants. Signaling his intention to move the case to trial as quickly as possible, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Wednesday rejected independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s proposal to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the classified material as too cumbersome. The proposed procedure for three months of pre-trial discovery `` appears to be far too complex, lacks definite time restrictions and creates undue obstacles to the fair and expeditious disposition of this case,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in a brief opinion. At a hearing scheduled for next Tuesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he `` intends to determine the timing of discovery disclosures in relation to a realistic trial date.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he will ask <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to say which documents `` will be made available immediately'' to the defense. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had said in pleadings filed Monday that he planned to turn over the material to the defendants in the next three months. The judge also said he wants to set a deadline this month for completion of an interagency review of the documents, which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says `` describe in detail some of the nation's most carefully held secrets about its foreign policy, its intelligence activities and its covert activities.'' An objection to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s plan was filed by defense lawyers for former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. The four are accused of conspiring to illegally divert proceeds from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. Among elements of the security plan the defense found objectionable was a requirement that the defendants and their lawyers answer detailed government questionnaires in order to obtain security clearances to review the documents. Requiring the defendants to answer detailed questions about their travel, aliases, corporate affiliations `` and other matters potentially at issue in the case'' could violate their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, the defense said. The joint opposition also noted that North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> had previously had access to many of the documents when they worked at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said `` it will be necessary to frame a more limited protective order fashioned to the nature of this case, which in essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified materials in classified channels from a highly classified site.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, his vanquished rival for the Republican presidential nomination, in their first private session since a stormy confrontation in February on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that the men had a `` good, friendly discussion'' during which they talked `` about how to beat Democrats.'' The meeting, held in the Capitol, followed an earlier session in the same building between <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The former television evangelist is continuing his quest for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination but has all but conceded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be his party's selection. Asked after his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> whether the two men had buried the hatchet, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I do n't have a hatchet. I'm a nice fellow.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he envisioned a role for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the general election in which the Kansan would work `` as much as he possibly has time to give. A lot of it's here and a lot of it I hope will be around the country.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked for the meeting and said the discussion was `` about getting <PERSON> George </PERSON> elected in November.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON> said later that the men talked about `` keeping the Republican nomination interesting until the convention'' in August and `` ways to get the issues out there.'' In an unusual floor confrontation Feb. 4 amid a Contra aid vote, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of condoning a campaign attack that amounted to `` groveling in the mud.'' The face-off was sparked by a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign statement headlined `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s cronyism and mean-spiritedness questioned.'' The statement by an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> aide implied that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> accepted favors from the wealthy and said three federal agencies were examining a defunct blind trust once held by his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called the statement `` nasty, mean, personal and vindictive.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was over-reacting and behaving like `` a typical schoolyard bully _ he can dish it out, but if someone hits him back, he starts whining.'' The incident epitomized the bitterness of the campaign between the two men. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dropped out of the race and endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month. After his meeting with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would stay in the race until he was assured that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform would be conservative enough to keep his supporters active in the campaign. He promised he would be loyal to the party's candidate. `` There's no question that we plan to support the Republican nominee, and it looks as though it's going to be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he wanted to be `` a rallying point for conservatives'' at the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> so he could encourage his supporters to remain involved in Republican politics. `` I want to make sure that it's the type of platform that will make them get in with both hands and both feet and go to work,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he would not campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before the April 19 primary, and said he would ask for the termination of his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection. In an interview published in Thursday's editions of the paper, he said it would be `` more quixotic than it is realistic'' to continue actively campaigning. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had already laid off most of his campaign staff and has made only a few campaign appearances recently, because he is bumping up against federal campaign spending limits.

<HEAD>New Laws Urged For Those Who Act To Spread AIDS Infection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The need to protect against people with the AIDS virus who knowingly try to spread the disease must be balanced against the need to protect individual rights, a public health expert told the White House AIDS commission. `` An isolation statute could require a due process determination that a viral carrier is unwilling or unable to refrain from engaging in conduct likely to spread the disease,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> testified Wednesday before the panel. `` Constitutionally allowable isolation would not focus on a person's status as having an infection or a disease, but upon his or her behavior leading to transmission,'' said <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Medicine and associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, was among 28 witnesses appearing before the panel in two days of hearings this week. The commission, working toward a June 24 final report, has scheduled three more days of hearings later this month. A <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prosecutor told the commission that existing laws are inadequate to deal with people who know they are infected with the virus and behave in a manner that could spread it to others. `` The citizens of this country deserve protection from being recklessly or intentionally targeted for exposure to this dreadful disease,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, the elected prosecuting attorney in <LOCATION> Genesee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, explained his rationale for filing assault with intent to murder charges against a man infected with the virus who tried to spit on police after being arrested for drunken driving `` He fought with the arresting officers and, once lodged, kept spitting through the bars of his cell, taunting the officers and daring them to come closer so he ` could give them AIDS,''' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` We filed ... under the theory that his expressed intention to communicate an incurable, terminal disease amounted to an intent to cause death,'' he explained. The court reduced the attempted murder charge to assault on an officer, partially on grounds there is insufficient evidence that the virus can be spread by spitting, said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. He said that although the `` percentage of AIDS carriers who will maliciously or irresponsibly place others at risk is largely speculative, this fact should not deter us from developing a legislative framework to control such conduct.''

<HEAD>Peugeot Shows High Head-Injury Potential, NHTSA Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says crash tests of nine 1988 vehicles show drivers of the Peugeot 505 GLS have the greatest chance of sustaining a head injury. A 35 mph crash of the four-door compact into a fixed barrier produced a head-injury criterion of 1701 on the driver, the highest recorded among this year's tests. The head-injury criterion is an index of the force experienced by occupants of the car, as measured by a test dummy. The passenger-side dummy recorded a head-injury criterion of 1457. The Peugeot results were among six released Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. The agency had tested three vehicles earlier in the year. The Toyota Corolla FX two-door hatchback, a subcompact, produced a head-injury criterion of 593 for the driver, and 397 for the passenger. The driver head-injury criterion was the least among the nine models tested this year. A second subcompact, the Toyota Tercel two-door hatchback, produced a head-injury criterion of 1005 for the driver and 398 for the passenger. In compact car crash tests, the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> Maxima SE four-door produced a head-injury criteria of 907 for the driver and 861 for the passenger, and the <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Le Mans two-door <PERSON> Aerocoupe </PERSON> produced head-injury criteria of 819 for the driver and 897 for the passenger. Wednesday's test results included one van, the <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanagon </ORGANIZATION>, with head-injury criteria of 1320 for the driver and 899 for the passenger. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> had released test results on the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Taurus and Mercury Sable. The crash-test results are intended to help consumers compare vehicles when deciding which to buy, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Only one vehicle of each model is tested, and further crash tests could produce different results, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The 35 mph crash speed was 5 mph faster, or one-third more severe, than that specified by federal motor vehicle safety standards. The 30 mph standards permit a maximum head-injury criterion of 1000, and higher figures can be expected at the higher speed, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Two local Republicans riding with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the vice presidential limousine were serving as a welcoming committee _ but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to talk business. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins this thing on the other side, you guys are going to have to help me in setting the record straight,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told them as his motorcade wound through narrow city streets from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> to a political rally at <LOCATION> Faneuil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. The vice president was talking about <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has a strong shot at facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the general election next fall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to make sure he knows the full details of the governor's record, said state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON>, who sat next to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Riding in the jump seat was state Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, who along with <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> is co-chairman of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` If we can help you understand the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> philosophy, we will do that,'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. That conversation, as recalled by the two senators, occurred Feb. 24, two weeks before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Super Tuesday landslide. Since then, his principal rival, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, has bowed out. With the nomination virtually locked up, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is plotting strategy against the Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose treasury and organization far outstrip those of the other Democrats, has drawn by far the most attention. With three wins in a row under his belt _ in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ he is well positioned for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary later this month. In addition, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the only Democrat who competes well against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in hypothetical matchups in recent public opinion polls. `` There's a perception within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is in a strong position to win it,'' <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> said. `` We're compiling data that will indicate that the governor did not have much to do with the strong economy in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' He maintained that military spending, tax cuts, a property tax limitation law and Reaganomics are responsible. `` We also want to be in a position where the vice president can demonstrate that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a liberal and he believes in big government,'' <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think that's anything that's going to be too difficult to demonstrate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> said, has been `` trying to move to the middle'' by touting his own tax reductions, his record of balancing budgets and his opposition to communist expansion in Central America. But <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> said, `` the change is so startling and dramatic that you have to question its sincerity.'' The intelligence-gathering effort on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not limited to the material <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> can provide. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which looks into the background of all the Democratic candidates, has had a researcher assigned to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for nearly a year, according to <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruggi </PERSON>. The researcher spent a full week at <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> state committee headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> poring over clippings, files and old speeches. The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> now has an extensive computer file at its fingertips into which key words like `` taxes,'' `` budgets'' and `` welfare'' can be punched to yield whatever <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said on the subjects. Citizens for Limited Taxation, a conservative taxpayer advocacy group in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, has distributed a 60-page information packet to reporters, Republican researchers and operatives for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Democratic opponents The packet _ color-coded by issues _ includes newspaper clippings with headlines like, `` Tax cut is vetoed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' and `` Report downplays <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> impact on economy.''

<HEAD>Kidnapping or Extradition? Overseas Drug Arrests Prompt Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug agents jokingly refer to it as `` Mexican extradition.'' Courts use the more dignified term, `` informal rendition.'' Defense attorneys call it just plain kidnapping. Whatever name you use, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities flexing the long arm of their law have had several successes luring, spiriting or forcing criminal suspects out of seeming safe havens abroad into custody in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It happened last year to an Arab who fell prey to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> ruse and ended up in custody to await trial in a 1985 <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> plane hijacking; to <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent accused of selling weapons to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and to Dr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, the drug cultists' icon of the 1960s who was tracked down in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after escaping from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jail. The most recent example occurred Tuesday, when a month-long U.S.-Honduran operation led to the unwilling odyssey of alleged international cocaine czar <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> from his home in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to a jail in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Honduran police abetted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals arrested <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> and put him on a plane to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where he was hustled to a flight bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and shipped to a federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, who holds Colombian and Honduran citizenship, was wanted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was sought for questioning in the murder of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Drug Enforcement agent in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. One law enforcement official described <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> as being `` stunned'' to find himself in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as the result of an operation apparently designed to get around Honduran law. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has extradition treaties with more than 100 countries, but many nations like <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> do not extradite their nationals. Even when they do, or if a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen is involved, the legal proceedings are sometimes long and often fruitless. There are surer ways to bring a suspect to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Wednesday. One method, as in the <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> case, is to get foreign governments to cooperate with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities to arrange a transfer. Or the suspect is lured back without foreign help. There have been some dramatic examples. Last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, undercover agents tracking <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a suspect in the hijacking of a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> aircraft, tricked him into going aboard a yacht in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and arrested him under a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law giving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> courts jurisdiction to try suspected terrorists who act against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> is awaiting trial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In 1982, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who had fled to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> after being indicted on weapons sales charges, was duped by an acquaintance into flying to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Authorities there put him on a non-stop flight to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he was arrested. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, who escaped in 1970 from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jail, was turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agents in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> even though the two countries had no extradition treaty. In a case that did involve extradition, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, a Colombian wanted in connection with a massive drug conspiracy, was flown to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last year to stand trial on narcotics charges. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, which has 65 offices in 43 countries, is especially active in what it calls `` cop-to-cop'' arrangements with foreign police agencies. Turning suspects over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities without formal proceedings is often called `` Mexican extradition,'' from the tradition of authorities in that country taking people to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border and sending them across the line into the waiting arms of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> police. The legal term is `` informal rendition,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government attorney said. `` We find someone in another country who is wanted here. We go to the authorities and say we're interested in the person. They kick him out by putting him on a plane to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that's it.'' He said it was not clear how many suspects come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year by such means. Defense attorneys in some of the celebrated cases _ notably the <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> cases _ have sought dismissal of charges on grounds the overseas arrests violated the defendant's rights by, in effect, kidnapping them. Appeals courts, however, have upheld the prosecutions in most cases, saying they are not particularly concerned about execution of the laws in foreign countries or how defendants got to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The only exception, based on a ruling by the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, would be a case in which the manner of a suspect's arrest and arrival in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody `` shocked the conscience'' of the court. Under that rule, the government could lose a case if the suspect proves he was tortured or otherwise severely mistreated in being arrested. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, who arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with two broken wrists after being arrested by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, is making such a claim. Sometimes, information supplied by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities leads to extradition between two other countries. In their investigation of the 1985 murder of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities informed <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> police that a suspect, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro-Quintero </PERSON>, was living in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He was arrested there and extradited to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to stand trial.

 The Chateau of <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, the former royal palace where <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIV </PERSON> spent his honeymoon, will be renovated, the government said. `` The chateau, as it stands, is a discouraging site,'' said former culture minister <PERSON> Jean-Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lecat </PERSON>, head of the renovation committee.

Lecat proposed a five-year, $ 30 million plan to turn the picturesque complex into a cultural facility to accomodate about 400,000 visitors yearly. The castle currently receives about 30,000 visitors each year. Completed in 1370 by King <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>, the castle originally was conceived as the cornerstone of a vast royal city he planned to control.

<HEAD>Contempt Citations Sought Against Reagan Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Contempt citations are being sought against <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> on a claim they are illegally blocking court-ordered warnings to 18 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers about toxic chemicals. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union filed suit against the two <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials Wednesday in the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, which ordered the warnings last year. Under `` right-to-know'' regulations ordered last May by the court and issued in August by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to begin levying fines of up to $ 10,000 when the warnings are absent. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has delayed implementation of the new requirements. The budget office claims some of the provisions run contrary to the 1980 Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the mounting number of forms that the government requires businesses to handle. In addition to the contempt citations, the Steelworkers want a court order fully implementing the regulations as issued last August by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and an injunction prohibiting the administration from taking any further action to thwart them. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the budget office, said officials have not seen the suit yet and, therefore, had no comment on it. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> appeals court is the same one that last May ordered <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> to issue the regulations or face a contempt citation then. The regulations require employers in several industries to make sure warning labels are on some 600,000 hazardous chemical products in an estimated 3.5 million workplaces employing 18 million workers. Administration officials have repeatedly cited the regulations as negating the need for the government to warn workers individually about health risks from exposure to carcinogens and other toxic substances. Those arguments were instrumental last week in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat of a House-passed bill that would have required individual warnings from the government to go out annually to some 300,000 workers judged to be at the greatest risk The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> had estimated those individual warnings and medical monitoring programs based on them would have prevented 250,000 cancer deaths over the next 10 years. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the `` right-to-know'' regulations would reduce chemically related injuries, illnesses and deaths in non-manufacturing industries by 20 percent a year. The regulations were recommended in 1975 by a federal advisory commission to combat the annual 100,000 deaths and 340,000 disabling illnesses and injuries blamed on occupational diseases. Formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Hazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, the warnings were imposed by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> on the chemical industry and its 1.4 million workers in 1985. A year later, under court orders in response to an earlier suit by the Steelworkers union, they were expanded to cover 14 million more workers employed by some 300,000 manufacturers. Then the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> federal appeals court last May ordered <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to expand the requirements further to protect the 18 million workers in agriculture, construction, services, transportation and office occupations. `` We'd thought that after a decade of litigation, we had won this fight,'' <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Seminario </PERSON>, a job health and safety specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` Now <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> through the back door is trying to negate it all.'' The regulations do not ban any hazardous substances or order any reductions in exposure. However they do require employers to post data sheets offering information on each hazardous product and to train workers on proper safeguards. The White House budget office has demanded that construction sites be excluded from the data sheet requirements. And, in response to complaints from the formaldehyde industry, it also has disapproved language requiring warnings on building materials and permanent-press fabrics treated with that chemical when they are shipped to apparel manufacturers. While many employers had sought the regulations because they pre-empt state and local right-to-know laws that often were more stringent, others opposed them out of fears of potential lawsuits. `` Documentary evidence has hung many a king, politician, financial wizard, whatever,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a private <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who specializes in workplace health and safety issues. `` And that's what this regulation provides.''

Both are described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as the highest-ranking members of their respective communist hierarchies ever to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and East German sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a May 3 meeting between <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Axen </PERSON> was arranged after the East German leader was invited to speak May 4 at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Axen </PERSON> holds no office in the East German government, but is the top international affairs officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the official name of the governing communist organization. <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON> is scheduled to meet <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during an April 25-26 visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, followed by a coast-to-coast trade promotion tour with a high-level delegation. Noted as an economic reformer, <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON> will be the first senior Bulgarian cabinet minister in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since World War II. Since 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has focused overtures toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s East European allies on human rights and economic issues. Over the past two years, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> has told leaders in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> readiness to expand commercial ties will depend on their willingness to strengthen respect for human rights. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said that during <PERSON> Axen </PERSON>'s talks, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials will renew pleas for more religious freedom in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. That country last year allowed two massive religious assemblies and permitted the Jewish community to install its first rabbi since 1967. In recent weeks, however, there has been a crackdown on environmental groups affiliated with churches, the official said. In talks with <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is expected to request better treatment of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s sizable Turkish and Islamic minorities. <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, accompanied by two deputy ministers, the chairman of the foreign trade bank and presidents of several leading Bulgarian foreign trade companies, has been invited to an April 25 question-and-answer session at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON> `` has a reputation throughout West and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for his creative mind and ability to articulate issues,'' the chamber said in its announcement. Formerly deputy prime minister, he assumed the new post of minister of foreign economic relations last Jan. 1 `` in recognition of the importance <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> places on foreign trade and investment,'' it added. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> wants to expand trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> beyond the current $ 130 million annual level. The Bulgarians plan to visit <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour lasting through May 2. <PERSON> Axen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also were expected to discuss efforts to settle financial claims estimated at more than $ 70 million by Americans whose property on East German territory was taken during and after World War II. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and East German officials said they doubted there would be serious talk about a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, as was reported in a West German magazine. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is known to be interested in such a visit `` but it is n't ripe for discussion,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> magazine is asking the <ORGANIZATION> Pulitzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prize </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider an award to The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer, saying the newspaper's prize-winning entry replicated earlier work by others including one of the magazine's reporters. Inquirer editors Wednesday denied the accusation by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> that reporter <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> used an earlier article by <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> as a `` blueprint'' for his series on a secret Pentagon budget. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s series won a Pulitzer for national writing. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, Inquirer deputy managing editor, said, `` I think it's a cheap publicity stunt to call attention to the magazine.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> editor, wrote Wednesday to the Pulitzer board, saying: `` We make no accusation of plagiarism, but by no account does the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer series deserve a Pulitzer because <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s reporting on the size and composition of the black budget plows no new journalistic ground.'' The weekly Journal, owned by Times-Mirror, does in-depth reporting on government and has a circulation of 5,000, mostly among government officials and journalists. An annual subscription costs $ 584. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, in an interview, said he did not complain about the <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> articles when they first appeared because his publication is used to having its work lead to reporting by others, but usually with some credit given. The Inquirer articles, published in February 1987, do not mention the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s report nearly a year earlier. `` They could have avoided this if they had given some credit,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, `` but then they would not have won the Pulitzer.'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, who shared a 1982 Pulitzer for reporting for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said he wrote a sidebar to his articles citing <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> and describing how he analyzed the secret budget, `` but it was spiked because it was deemed too boring.'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said he does not write to win prizes and feared journalism would be hurt by what he said are false allegations. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> board secretary, said he had been informed of the complaint but had not yet read the letter requesting board action. `` Clearly any allegation of this kind, any complaint of this kind would be considered,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s story `` can only be read as a blatant and egregious case of building a news story according to someone else's blueprint: in this case, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s March 1, 1986, cover story, ` The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Black Budget.''' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> told the board that several other news organizations also had earlier written about the money used to underwrite secret defense research and unpublicized aspects of the arms buildup. He enclosed copies of the Journal and Inquirer stories, along with a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> article on preparations for World War IV, which he said <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> `` substantially replicates'' in one of his reports. The letter cites quotations from <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s story that are nearly identical to those in <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s article and says in several places <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s phrasing and detail echo those in <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s article However, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he was not accusing <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> of lifting quotes _ he said at least one official acknowledged saying exactly the same thing to both reporters. `` Most of <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s sources are pretty much the ones that <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> had used a year earlier,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wrote. `` We are confident that the board, armed with these facts, will reconsider its awarding of the prize to the Weiner series,'' the letter said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> in 1985 became the first to use Pentagon documents to determine the size of the `` black budget.'' At the time <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> was a senior research analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, an independent think tank. He later joined the Journal. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, interviewed at the Journal office, said he thought <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> did `` an amazingly poor job in developing the story, considering the amount of time he had.'' He said the Pulitzer board should make awards for ground-breaking stories, adding, `` I'm sorry they failed to do this.'' Inquirer Managing Editor <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> called the Journal protest an `` unfair attack on <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>'s reporting.'' He said both stories quote some of the same sources because there are few sources available on the matter. `` The Journal did not inspire our story. We did not replicate but went well beyond what it reported,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said he interviewed more than 100 people around the country and was `` knee-deep in this before I saw <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s work.'' `` I think <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> is a terrific reporter, and he did fine work on this subject. But he's making a false accusations, and it's a false controversy that's going to ultimately hurt journalism,'' he said `` I do n't write stories to win prizes, and I wrote these to bring an important public policy issue to people's attention,'' he said. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> editor for investigative projects, said the Inquirer laid the groundwork for the `` black budget'' story even before <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> became involved and long before the <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> article was written.

<HEAD>Analysis of Single Hair Helps Identify Owner; May Help Solve

<TEXT>
 A technique for analyzing extremely small bits of genetic material shows promise for helping identify criminals from a single hair left at a crime scene, researchers reported today. The technique revealed which variant of a particular gene each of six people had, by analysis of a single hair each person had shed, the scientists wrote in the British journal Nature. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, deputy assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, called the work `` very exciting.'' The technique can not yet prove that a hair came from a particular person, but in combination with other evidence its result can be seen as `` very, very significant,'' he said. Further refinements may let it make identifications with more certainty, The work was conducted by <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Higuchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Erlich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cetus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensabaugh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Beroldingen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. It focuses on DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, which forms tiny thread-like structures called chromosomes in every cell of the body. DNA consists of sequences of chemicals. Some sequences form genes, which control the activities of a cell. Details of DNA sequences vary from person to person, and researchers have exploited that fact to help solve crimes by studying such `` DNA fingerprints.'' In February, for example, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> jury convicted a 24-year-old man of rape after testimony that his DNA matched that found in semen left by the rapist. Hair that has been ripped from the body, as in a struggle, often contains enough living tissue in its root area for conventional DNA analysis. But more often, police recover hair that has simply fallen off a person at the crime scene, and that hair contains far less DNA, experts say. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> researchers overcame that problem by using a laboratory technique called polymerase chain reaction that created 100 billion copies of a particular portion of DNA. The ability to analyze a single hair is important, said <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, because that is typically all that is available at crime scenes. In addition, multiple hairs from a crime scene may have come from different people, said forensic hair expert <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenik </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> McCrone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. At present, a shed hair is examined microscopically for its physical appearance, <PERSON> Palenik </PERSON> said. But because different people can have similar-looking hairs, the new DNA technique `` represents a very important first step'' toward firm identification of people from a shed hair, he said. In the study, the researchers reported using a test to determine which of 21 versions of the `` DQ alpha'' gene is present in an individual. The gene plays a role in the disease-fighting immune system. In tests of six people, the researchers reported, a single shed hair correctly indicated which version of the gene each person had. More recent tests show success rates of 40 to 70 percent, <PERSON> Higuchi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, adding that researchers plan to try an improved testing procedure. He said the next step is testing for more genetic characteristics, to allow greater certainty in linking a hair to a particular person. If the hair and a person share characteristics that fewer than one in 1,000 people possess, that would greatly help in making the link in court, he said. Standard DNA fingerprint techniques offer more definitive matches, with the chance of two people sharing the same DNA characteristics described as one in several billion. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said that with further development, the new technique could well `` approach the fingerprint-type identifying capability. That's what we'd be looking for down the road.''

 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> students marched Wednesday to protest a racial slur made the previous day by former Gov. A.B. `` Happy'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who helped the first black players get into major league baseball. About 40 students marched across campus to meet with university President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON> to call for an apology by <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> or his resignation from the school's board of trustees. Some marchers expressed anger with placards such as `` Hopefully Happy is Sad,'' while others demanded an explanation, shouting `` We want to know!'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a two-time governor of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, reacted by saying, `` They're trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.'' He said he had no plans to apologize unless asked to do so by <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON> or Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>. But in an interview with the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Herald-Leader, he said: `` If it is offensive, I'm ready to say I'm just really sad and sorry. In other words, my head is bloody but unbowed.'' During a committee's discussion Tuesday of the university's 1985 decision to sell off its investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said, `` You know <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s all nigger now. There are n't any whites.'' `` I do n't think I should be censured for this,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` I do n't think I deserve any harsh treatment. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, 89, was commissioner of baseball from 1945-51 and takes credit for opening the door for <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to become the first black to play major-league baseball when <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> in 1947. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, who appointed <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> to a voting position on the university governing board earlier this year, said Wednesday that he believed <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> meant nothing derogatory but should apologize anyway. `` It was a bad statement and it was a statement that should never be made,'' <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said, `` and I'm going to recommend to him that he apologize and explain it.'' In the telephone interview, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said that while growing up in <LOCATION> Corydon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> `` there were 400 whites and 400 blacks. We called them niggers and they did n't mind. We loved each other. We never had any trouble. `` I integrated schools when other governors were sending troops in to keep blacks out. I was sending troops in to keep them in.'' He was governor in 1935-39, and again in 1955-59. <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON> told the students that the `` university completely and totally repudiates what it is Governor <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> says.'' But he said he did n't known yet whether there would be any action against <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON> said he hopes some good comes from the incident such as the need for `` a continuing, aggressive program of action to put aside all semblances of racial prejudice at this <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' effort to widen his delegate lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination took him briefly out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and into <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where he visited his alma mater The visit to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was one of dozens expected from candidates in the three weeks before the state's April 26 primary, when 178 Democratic delegates are at stake. `` We're going to pick up probably half of their time while they're in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' campaigning for 225 delegates at stake there April 19, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatch </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, holding a slight edge over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> after winning the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary Tuesday, spent the first part of the following day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Baby M Dispute Ends With Surrogate Mom Getting Unsupervised Visits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bitter Baby M custody fight ended with surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> winning unsupervised visitation rights she says will allow `` a meaningful and substantial relationship'' with her daughter. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> on Wednesday urged both sides in the dispute to protect 2-year-old <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, known to the world as Baby M, by resolving their differences and keeping the child out of the public eye. `` The court does not underestimate the great difficulty the parties will have in accepting others' roles in <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s life,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said in the ruling granting gradually expanded, unsupervised visitation to Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>. `` However, family tragedies in our society are not uncommon and parents often are called upon to make sacrifices arising from unforseen circumstances,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, wo n't appeal <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>'s ruling, bringing an end to a highly publicized dispute that sparked worldwide debate on reproduction technologies. <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> also barred both sides from discussing publicly their relationships with <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, but allowed them to talk about their experiences in general. This clears the way for publication of Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s book. It has no effect on films or books written without the involvement of the people in the case. <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> rejected the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>' contention during a three-day hearing last week that <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> would suffer psychologically by seeing Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> and that the child had developed no emotional attachment to her mother. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, who is 31 today, will have one six-hour visit a week, under the ruling. <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said the schedule will be expanded during the next year to include overnight stays, holidays and two weeks in the summer of 1989. `` I am delighted and grateful to know that as <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> grows up we will have a meaningful and substantial relationship with each other,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> said in a statement released by her lawyers. `` I have struggled in order to preserve our relationship,'' she said. `` That relationship has been preserved; in fact, it will be strenghthened and advanced.'' The <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>, who have custody of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and are both 42 years old, wanted <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> to delay for at least six years visits between <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, who had been seeing the child for two hours once a week under supervision. They were disappointed with the ruling on visitation, but pleased with the judge's decision on publicity, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, one of the Tenafly couple's attorneys. `` They wanted to put an end to the litigation and the publicity and protect <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. The judge, in a written decision filed in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> and made public here, said both sides must come to terms with their new relationship. The judge said Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> must remember she is not the primary caretaker for the child she named <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> but now calls <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. He said the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> will make parental decisions in such areas as religion and education. `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> must accept and understand that <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> is not <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> and that her father and stepmother will be her parental role models and provide the day-to-day, parent-child interaction,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> must accept and understand that <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> will develop a different and special relationship with her mother, stepfather, siblings and extended family, and that these relationships need not dminish their parent-child relationship with <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> said. The tug-of-war began after Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, then married to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, agreed to be artificially inseminated with <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s sperm. She gave birth to <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> on March 31, 1986, but decided to refuse the $ 10,000 surrogate fee and keep the baby. That led to a landmark <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, which outlawed surrogacy-for-pay, restored Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s parental rights, upheld custody for the Sterns and ordered the lower court hearing on visitation rights Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> has since divorced <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> and married <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. The couple, from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, is expecting a child soon. In a related development, a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Wednesday approved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to bear a child.

<TEXT>
 An 18-year-old man married a woman he had never seen outside of jail or the courtroom five minutes before he was sentenced to 27-years-to-life in prison for murder. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON> and his 30-year-old bride, <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> <PERSON> Natale </PERSON> exchanged vows in a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge's chambers shortly after his sentencing judge refused to perform the ceremony, said defense attorney <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON>, of Troy, was convicted for his role in the 1987 stabbing death of 81-year-old <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> suburb of Watervliet A companion, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, received an 18-years-to-life sentence. <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON> was introduced to <PERSON> Natale </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> hairdresser, during a jailhouse visit shortly after he was arrested in March 1987, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. The pair corresponded frequently and <PERSON> Natale </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON> in jail, the attorney said. She faithfully attended her future husband's murder trial. A few days before the sentencing, <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON> told his lawyer he wanted to get married. `` I attempted to discourage them because they really did n't have an opportunity to formulate a relationship,'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. `` They insisted that they wanted to get married.'' <PERSON> Natale </PERSON>, dressed in a plain white dress for her wedding, said she did n't want people thinking she's foolish for marrying <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON>. `` I love him and I believe he's innocent,'' she said before ducking away from reporters. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Court Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> refused to marry the couple, but delayed sentencing to give the lawyer a chance to find a judge who would perform the ceremony. Supreme Court Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> agreed. <PERSON> Mastoprietro </PERSON> could n't have been married after the sentencing because under state law, prisoners serving life sentences can not get a marriage license, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. During the ceremony, <PERSON> Natale </PERSON> gave a ring to <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON>, who could n't reciprocate. The lawyer said he was n't sure when the couple will have the chance to be alone together. Only some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prisons allow conjugal visits, but there's a long waiting list for the privilege, he said. `` I spoke to this woman at length and she's committed to this young man,'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure if it's love or the kind of human concern that develops for another person that does n't have anything to do with romantic love.'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said he's appealing <PERSON> Mastroprietro </PERSON>'s conviction. <PERSON> Mastroprietro </PERSON> was given the maximum sentence. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>'s bid for leniency in sentencing <PERSON> Mastropietro </PERSON>, saying `` what happened here transcended the normal bounds of society.'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> was found stabbed in her home on March 8, 1987. <PERSON> Mastroprietro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> had gone there with the intent of stealing her car. The woman's hands were tied and she was stabbed three times in her side. Doctors said she lingered for several hours before dying.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> launched a new enforcement sweep Wednesday night against gang members whose violent behavior has shocked the nation's second-largest city in recent weeks. About 260 officers joined in Wednesday night's sweep. The task force concentrated on gang `` hot spots'' in four police jurisdictions, said police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. `` There's been scattered reports of shots fired,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said, indicating accounts of police hearing gunfire. `` But as of right now we have n't had any shootings.'' Officers set up a mobile booking unit in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Memorial Coliseum where they were processing dozens of people arrested for a variety of suspected offenses, including parole violation and weapons possession. A department bus was taking those arrested to jail. Last year, more than 400 people died from gang violence. District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said if current trends hold, that number will be topped this year. On Tuesday, a city finance committee approved an additional $ 2.5 million for police to use in fighting the city's unrelenting gang violence. The added $ 2.5 million was expected to win final approval from the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. It would pay for 1,000 extra officers to be deployed in gang-infested areas and would cover police overtime costs in fighting gang violence. Shootings like one Friday that killed one person and injured a dozen others have created an emergency situation, city officials say.

 A drug ring openly run by a small-town fire chief, police chief and their families was protected by a web of bribes that has implicated two county sheriffs and commissioners, according to court documents. The latest to agree to a plea bargain in the case involving the town of <LOCATION> Kermit </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, who is trying to avoid trial on 13 felony counts alleging that he bought his job for $ 100,000 and then protected the ring, court documents say. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> called <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>'s alleged activities `` the most appalling abuse of public office since <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> gave away the monarchies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to his relatives. The joint federal-state probe began two years ago when investigators discovered drugs being sold so freely in <LOCATION> Kermit </LOCATION>, a town of 700 in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, that undercover officers were able to photograph a `` No Drugs Today'' sign posted outside a trailer. So far, the investigation of the ring, which sold cocaine, PCP and other drugs, has netted more than 50 convictions or guilty pleas, with no acquittals. Among those serving sentences of up to 16 years for operating the ring are former Kermit Fire Chief <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> <PERSON> Preece </PERSON>; his wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; their son-in-law, former Police Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramey </PERSON>; and their four sons and two of their daughters. A third daughter was placed on probation. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> will be sentenced in federal court on April 18, the same day as <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> Mingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman and sheriff accused of selling his sheriff's job to <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> faces up to 14 years in prison and $ 700,000 in fines. An court order filed Tuesday provided no further information on <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>'s proposed plea agreement. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> would face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole if convicted of all 13 counts. In an interview this week, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> denied knowing about the <PERSON> Preece </PERSON> drug operation when he sold his job, but said `` it's going to be a better Mingo'' because of the investigation. `` If nothing else, it's made people realize that it was wrong. Even if they knew it was wrong, they did n't know the extent it was wrong,'' he said. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, who is free on $ 100,000 bail and continues to serve as sheriff, could not be reached at his office Wednesday night, and his home number was unlisted. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said he accepted a $ 20,000 downpayment on the $ 100,000 bribe from <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, then persuaded the three county commissioners to accept his resignation and appoint <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> in exchange for half of the bribe. Former Commissioner <PERSON> Rastie </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to federal income tax evasion charges related to the bribe and awaits sentencing later this month. Commissioner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, the only member of the 1982 panel still in office, was indicted Jan. 15 on one count of bribery. He has denied the charge but is not running for re-election. The third commissioner, state Sen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON>, has not been charged in federal or state court. He has adamantly denied any knowledge of the sale of the sheriff's office. Also caught by the investigation was county political boss <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to three felony charges of protecting the <PERSON> Preece </PERSON> drug ring, using public funds for political campaigns and intimidating a witness. The indictment against <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> accuses him of two counts of racketeering in connection with buying both his office and a spot on a powerful county political slate from <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. He also faces two counts of aiding and abetting the <PERSON> Preece </PERSON> family drug operation `` by seeing to it the law was n't enforced'' in return for illegal campaign contributions.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave a spirited defense of his credentials as he pleaded with supporters to provide him the funds to finish the last stage of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. `` The only hope for the campaign's success is to believe in it enough to invest in it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Wednesday at a fund-raiser at an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> nightclub, which approximately 650 people paid $ 20 apiece to attend. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a close second to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the number of delegates won. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a distant third. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his campaign's ability to survive financially through delegate-selection procedures in 40 states shows his management skill.

<TEXT>
 The Arab hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner today released 32 more hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and told negotiators those remaining aboard will be in serious danger if their demands are not met. The hijackers singled out three members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family, two of them women, who they said will be among the first passengers `` to pay a dear price,'' according to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. The hijackers, armed with grenades and pistols, are demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in that <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state in 1983. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> rejected the demand, calling it `` blackmail,'' but also sent a government delegation to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport in northeastern <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to negotiate. Fifty-seven passengers and crew members have been freed by the Arabic-speaking hijackers since they forced the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 to land at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport on Tuesday. That left roughly 50 hostages aboard the jumbo jet, which was comandeered en route to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. All the remaining hostages were believed to be Arabs, including at least 30 Kuwaitis, and all but two of them men. The nationality of the hijackers was not known. Hostages who have been freed said there are five or six hijackers, all wearing masks. In a statement, the hijackers today said they considered those remaining aboard political prisoners they will use to `` settle our account'' with the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government, said <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, which is monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. As soon as the 32 left the plane at 2:30 a.m. today -LRB- 7 p.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB- the hijackers slammed the doors shut and switched off the lights in the cabin, warning Iranian security forces not to approach the aircraft, the agency said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the 32 hostages released today included 12 Britons, six Thais, three Pakistanis, two Austrians, two Syrians, one Japanese, one Irish, one German, one Lebanese, one Sudanese, one South Korean and one from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. Twenty-four female hostages were released on Wednesday and a Jordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on Tuesday. In a statement issued shortly before today's release, the hijackers said they they wanted the world to know the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> government severely tortures Moslem prisoners, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The statement said the world must realize `` the real nature of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> rulers who have overlooked all the problems of the Moslem world, at the top of them the issue of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and the brave Palestinians who are fighting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The hijackers stressed they would not back down from their demand, `` even if the price is too high.'' The members of the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> royal family aboard have been identified as <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, a businessman, and his two sisters, <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> and Anware. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> on Wednesday relayed a message to the <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> control tower through a doctor asking the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation at the airport to negotiate with the hijackers, to ask <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ruling <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> family to accept the hijackers' demands. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> `` whose voice was shaking, was overtaken by strong physical tension and panic.'' The hijackers had contacted the control tower earlier Wednesday, asking for a doctor to be sent to the plane. After receiving treatment from the doctor, <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> passed her message to the tower, adding that she and her sister were `` feeling alright,'' the radio added. Food was also brought earlier Wednesday to those still aboard the jet. Release of the 17 jailed Shiites has been a recurring demand of Shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to Iranian <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many acts of terrorism in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have been blamed on Shiite Moslems acting for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has been at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since September 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Electronic Device Would Help Drivers Beat Gridlock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Relief may be in sight for frustrated motorists trapped on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s gridlocked highways _ in sight, that is, on a 4-inch dashboard video screen. As part of a pilot traffic management program unveiled Wednesday by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, little black boxes will alert drivers to road congestion and traffic accidents on electronic road maps displayed on the dash. The sophisticated devices, which transportation officials used last year to help monitor traffic during Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, will then help motorists snake their way around traffic problems by flashing alternate routes on the screen. `` This system will help the user avoid problems rather than driving into and becoming part of the problem itself,'' Department Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said at a news conference announcing the project. The $ 1.6 million test of the system will begin this summer in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. During the study, which is a joint project involving the department, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, drivers hired by the state will cruise the congested <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> in 25 cars equipped with the units. On-board computers will relay the location and speed of the cars to the the state agency's traffic operations office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, improving the accuracy and timeliness of traffic reports the department relays to media outlets. To operate the device, a driver inserts a cassette containing an electronic map of an area up to 10 miles from the car and selects a destination. An arrow on the 4-inch-square screen then traces the vehicle's progress along roads. The state agency currently uses television monitoring and electronic road sensors placed every quarter-mile along 300 miles of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' most congested freeways to gather road information. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, notorious for its rush-hour traffic, is the only area now wired to accommodate the two-way, high-tech navigational system, which will utilize the sensor monitoring system. A similar system for 215 miles of congested freeways in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> would cost $ 130 million, officials said. The units, which are commercially available for about $ 2,500 apiece, will cost between $ 300 and $ 500 when they are mass-produced, officials said. But even if the pilot program goes well, it may be 10 years before the technology is perfected and the system is available to most drivers. In a test run after the news conference, officials were embarrassed when one of four units failed to work properly. `` This one needs to be recalibrated, I guess,'' said driver <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Juje </PERSON>, of the state agency. `` I guess we pushed too many buttons.'' Nevertheless, officials heralded the beginning of the project as an important next step. `` If we want to continue to make owning and operating a car a pleasure instead of a chore, one challenge our industry must take up _ and quickly _ is improving the commuting experience,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angew </PERSON>, director of programs and planning for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is providing the cars and support personnel for the project. The state is contributing $ 900,000, and the federal agency is providing $ 750,000 and technical assistance. More than half of all congestion is caused by accidents and incidents that distract drivers' attention, officials said. Urban congestion `` ca n't be solved entirely by more asphalt and concrete,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, an official with the federal agency.

In other developments Wednesday, police fired tear gas and birdshot to break up an opposition demonstration in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> completed deployment of 1,300 extra troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to beef up security for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel and property in the former <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone. Also Wednesday, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, announced the government had agreed to talks with opposition groups `` without preconditions or irreconcilable demands.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said 800 Marines would start arriving in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Friday for what it described as three weeks of routine jungle training. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition, which has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster for more than 10 months, sponsored a `` march against hunger'' Wednesday afternoon, but police flooded the park where it was to take place in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, about 50 protesters met at a nearby church and began a march to the central business district. They had gone nearly a mile when police stopped them with a barrage of tear gas and birdshot. Hundreds of people jeered at the police from sidewalks and balconies despite the swirls of tear gas that enveloped blocks of Central Avenue, the main shopping thoroughfare. Many onlookers threw garbage into the avenue and sidestreets and set fire to piles of refuse. It took more than an hour for police to restore order. No injuries were immediately reported. A state-owned television station reported that two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in an Army jeep were stopped and detained by Panamanian troops near the protest. Maj. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Crum </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said the soldiers were freed an hour later. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition he was not identified, said the two American soldiers apparently got lost and drove into the area by accident. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the case. The march was designed to protest a deteriorating economic situation that has left thousands of Panamanians penniless.

<HEAD>Parents of 28 Children Get Keys To 15-Bedroom Dream Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FIFE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornyn </PERSON> and 23 of their 28 children pulled up in the family bus and then received the keys to a 15-bedroom, eight-bathroom dream house remodeled for them with government help. `` This is all very exciting,'' said <PERSON> Cornyn </PERSON>, a 42-year-old chief warrant officer stationed at nearby <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> who has been in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for 24 years. `` We're all very ecstatic.'' The Cornyns adopted 25 of their children, including some who are South Korean, Colombian, Indian, Amerasian and black and some with disabilities. Some are wheelchair-bound or move about on crutches. They all help care for each other. `` We have a rainbow family,'' said <PERSON> Cornyn </PERSON>. `` We have just about every color there is. We look at the rainbow as God's promise.'' The family, except for three children who were in school and two in a hospital, were at Wednesday's ceremonies. `` Perhaps in the future we'll need more bedrooms,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Cornyn </PERSON>. `` But this is a dream come true. Somebody believed in us enough to help us. This is something we thought would never happen.'' Excited smiles shone on the faces of the children, who range from age 8 months to 26 years, as they explored the 5,620-square-foot house. It has eight bathrooms, a downstairs family room that takes up nearly the entire floor and two washing machines, dryers and dishwashers. A yard big enough for a softball game surrounds the rambling white house at the end of a tree-lined road in this rural town 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` I have two children. Believe me, you've got to be courageous,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., who presented the keys to the Cornyns `` It's touching and rewarding to see a family like this.'' The house was remodeled at a cost of $ 60,000 by the <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed last April 24. Called Project 30 because the <PERSON> Cornyn </PERSON> family numbers 30, the home purchase and remodeling job is the first project undertaken by the association, which is leasing the house to the Cornyns. The Cornyns were high school sweethearts in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> who married as soon as <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> graduated. They adopted their first child when the family was stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1979. `` I guess we do it because it feels good and it's the right thing to do,'' <PERSON> Coryn </PERSON> said. `` It just makes us feel good to help someone else. We enjoy seeing these children grow physically and mentally.'' He noted that many of his adopted children would be in institutions if he and his wife had n't adopted them. <PERSON> Cornyn </PERSON> said some of his adopted children received supplemental Social Security benefits and the family also receives food from local food banks and clothes from `` lots of people.'' The Cornyns are the largest family housed under the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s housing voucher program, receiving $ 700 monthly toward rent and utilities. The Cornyns are moving from a six-bedroom home in <LOCATION> Puyallup </LOCATION> to their new home, which has been expanded during the past six months from eight bedrooms. `` It seems like we've never had enough room,'' said <PERSON> Cornyn </PERSON>.

<HEAD>EPA Won't Tighten Limits on Exposure To Cancer-Causing Benzene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says it intends to reaffirm an air pollution standard for benzene, a known cause of cancer, but critics say the proposal could subject exposed people to 10 times the risk the agency normally considers acceptable. A memorandum from <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, made available Wednesday, said the agency would not propose further regulations for benzene equipment leaks, which probably subject the most exposed individual to a one in 1,000 risk of leukemia. The memo called on agency officials to draft regulations essentially reaffirming the agency's decisions in 1984 not to regulate benzene exposure from the manufacture of ethylbenzene and styrene, storage of benzene in tanks and the manufacture of maleic anyhydride; but to impose regulations on coke oven emissions and equipment leaks in chemical plants and refineries. The leaks regulations have been adopted; the coke oven regulations are still only a proposal. A leading environmentalist attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> move `` an outrageous decision and a complete betrayal of the public health objectives of the Clean Air Act,'' saying the new standard will allow a level of risk 1,000 times what should be permitted. But an agency spokesman said that only an estimated two people are exposed to a risk of greater than one in 10,000 under the EPA standards.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is retreating from a stand that would have barred aliens facing deportation from having their asylum requests heard before an immigration judge. Earlier rules proposed last Aug. 28 would have required that all claims for asylum and withholding of deportation be heard by asylum officers of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Civil liberties groups say <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is unsympathetic to asylum-seekers, an accusation the agency denies. Under the latest proposed revision, immigration judges _ who work for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, not <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> _ would continue to conduct adversarial proceedings for those asylum-seekers facing exclusion from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or deportation. The change `` is an important improvement,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, a attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>.

 Chinese authorities have arrested 203 people for illegal hunting of the endangered giant panda and recovered 146 pelts, representing about one in seven of all pandas alive at the last count, according to the World Wildlife Fund. `` These are shocking revelations,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, president of the fund's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate, said in a statement Wednesday. `` The situation appears to be worsening for the panda,'' with the march to extinction more advanced than previously believed and hunting the greatest threat. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said it was the first time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had released such detailed statistics.

<HEAD>Recently Freed Prisoner Accused Of Brutal Attacks On Two Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MADISON, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man recently freed from prison brutally attacked one woman, then assaulted a newspaper photographer's wife who was left at home with her children when her husband went to cover the first attack, police said. <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Riles </PERSON>, 38, was being held today in lieu of $ 425,000 bond on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, sexual abuse, robbery and burglary in the abduction and attack of a convenience store clerk early Wednesday, police said. He also was charged with robbery and burglary in the attack on <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON>, 26, while her husband, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, was out covering the earlier assault, officials said. Additional charges may be filed, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liles </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney. Mrs. <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON> was in serious condition at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The sexual assault victim, who had been left for dead, was in critical condition at the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The Dabners' 2-year-old son was beaten and required hospital treatment, <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> said. Their 5-month-old sone was unhurt. After the first attack was reported on police radio at about 3 a.m., <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON> went to The -LRB- Fort Madison -RRB- Daily Democrat office to contact a reporter about covering the story together. At the office, `` he heard on the -LRB- police radio -RRB- scanner that there was a domestic assault at 3103 Avenue K _ his home,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the newspaper's editor. <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON> rushed home to find police there and his wife injured. Police said they were first alerted following the robbery and abduction at knife point of the convenience store clerk. Police said the woman was driven away, but that after a few blocks her abductor's car ran off the road and became disabled. The woman was repeatedly sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten, then left for dead in a vacant house, <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said a bloodstained man knocked on the back door of the <LOCATION> Dabner </LOCATION> home at about 4:30 a.m. and told Mrs. <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON> he needed to use the phone because he had been in a bad accident and his wife was seriously injured. Once inside, the man took $ 20 from Mrs. <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON> and beat her on the head with a piece of wood before fleeing, <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON> later said he suspected the man may have been walking by his home when he saw <PERSON> Dabner </PERSON> driving to the assignment. `` It was a coincidence,'' he said. `` We did n't know the guy or anything.'' A manhunt led to the arrest of Riles about five hours later, police said. An affidavit filed in <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said that after his arrest Riles waived his rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present, and admitted to all the charges but attempted murder. Riles was released from a state prison last November and from a halfway house in Cedar Rapids recently to complete a sentence for an earlier conviction for theft and willful injury, <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> said it was his understanding that <PERSON> Riles </PERSON> had satisfied the 15-year sentence by serving six years, with the remainder of the time accounted for by such provisions as time off for good behavior.

<HEAD>Arrest Warrant Issued For Delvalle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government issued an arrest warrant for deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, saying he will be charged with crimes against the state and the nation's economic security. In another development, the government offered to hold church-mediated talks with the political opposition. The offer came after police fired birdshot to break up an anti-government rally by 50 people on Wednesday. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers were briefly detained near the site of the protest. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been in hiding since Feb. 26, when he was removed from office after trying to fire Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as head of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the power behind the civilian government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president, responded to his ouster by imposing economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a bid to drive out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The sanctions forced <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks to close and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has not been able to make the government payroll. Food and cash are in short supply. The government announced Wednesday night that it had issued arrest warrants for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and for <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON>, a businessman and former ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The government said a warrant was issued earlier for <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who has remained there. In another development Wednesday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> completed deployment of 1,300 extra troops to beef up security for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel and property in the canal zone. An additional 800 Marines are to begin arriving Friday for what the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> called three weeks of routine jungle training that had been planned before the campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> plunged <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into crisis. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has called the deployment a prelude to invasion. The arrest warrants were announced Wednesday night by government prosecutor <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Visuetti </PERSON> on military-controlled Channel 2 television. He said an investigation had uncovered sufficient evidence to charge <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> with crimes against the state, usurping public duties and crimes against the nation's economic security. Earlier Wednesday, acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said the government had agreed to Roman Catholic Church-mediated talks with the opposition, which has been trying to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since June. In a letter to Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said the meeting should be held `` without preconditions or irreconcilable demands.'' He said the general had named him to head the government mediation effort. The opposition has said that, before entering such talks, it wants assurances that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is willing to step down and leave the country. It had no immediate response to <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s letter. The 1,300 newly arrived <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops joined about 10,000 American military personnel based at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and 670 others sent in earlier in the crisis. They include members of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> aviation battalion from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and military police from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mead </LOCATION>, Md. Also ferried in were 26 helicopters, including seven powerful AH-1 Cobra gunships. In ordering the buildup last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the new troops were needed to provide security for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and installations because of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` heavy-handed tactics.'' A heavy police presence thwarted a planned `` march against hunger'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday but about 50 demonstrators nevertheless began walking to the central business district from a church. They shouted anti-Noriega slogans and waved white handkerchiefs until police caught up with them and dispersed them, shoppers and other pedestrians with birdshot and volleys of tear gas. Plainclothes police armed with M-16 rifles made several arrests, but no injuries were immediately reported. From three tiers of balconies above, apartment residents hurled garbage into the street to protest the police action. `` This is what they shoot at the people, like we were beasts,'' yelled a middle-aged woman as she held up two empty 12-gauge shotgun shell casings she picked up on the street. `` We've had it up to here.'' `` Panamanians are tired of this,'' she said. `` We want the gringos to attack _ not tomorrow, today.'' A state-owned television station said Panamanian troops stopped and detained two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers they stopped in an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> jeep near the demonstration. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Crum </PERSON> said the soldiers were released an hour later. The soldiers apparently got lost and drove into the area by accident, said an officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 The Democratic presidential quartet effectively becomes a trio today as Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> puts his campaign on hold. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, meanwhile, zeroed in on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> issues, seen as a likely sore spot for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the upcoming <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has lost everywhere except in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, scheduled a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference to talk about his campaign future. Aides said he was suspending the campaign, but stopping short of dropping out. The three remaining active Democrats were all campaigning today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which holds its primary April 19. At stake are 255 delegates, in what will be the biggest state contest to date. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, in an interview published today, said he is unlikely to make an endorsement before the primary. And he warned the Democrats _ singling out <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ that negative campaigning is `` terribly dangerous.'' On the Republican side, there was plenty of parley: Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the nominee in all but name, met Wednesday with former rival Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who pledged to work to get <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> elected. And <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who remains in the Republican race although he concedes he has little chance of being nominated. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to suspend campaigning `` reflects the reality of having lost a great many primaries and caucuses,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, adding that by remaining in the race he would give his supporters a voice at the convention. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, said her son would remain an official candidate, if not an active one. `` He's going to hang in there till the end,'' she said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> made his last stand in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where he finished a weak fourth in Tuesday's primary. The Illinois senator ran second in the leadoff <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses on Feb. 8, in what was to be his best showing of the campaign outside of his home state. After finishing third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> a week later, he did not have enough money to campaign actively for the round of contests on Super Tuesday, March 8, and was consequently clobbered. Many expected him to drop out after that, but <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, under pressure from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> supporters, stayed in for his home-state primary, then said his victory there was enough reason to remain in the race. For the other Democrats, the battle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> began in earnest on Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at work courting voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s large Jewish community, stressing the need for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace plan that would allow <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` live in peace and harmony. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> reiterated his strong support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as he campaigned Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said as president, he would create a Cabinet-level position to focus full-time on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for a lack of experience in international affairs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> decried such infighting, saying his admonition was directed mainly at <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous and counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the nominee,'' he said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, seen by some Democrats as a potential draftee in the event of a deadlocked convention, said he preferred to wait until after the primary season to make an endorsement. `` That's the time for leadership in this process,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, after spending a day in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, which holds <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucuses on April 16, and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where primary day is May 3. In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked how he expected to do among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Jewish voters. `` You'll never get all of any one group,'' he said. `` All you can do is reach out. I've reached out and I'm glad to see people are responding.'' Many Jews were offended by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' _ for which he apologized _ and his association with <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, who called <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> a `` gutter religion.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> no longer has ties to <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, his campaign says. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made numerous efforts to mend fences with the Jewish community. After three straight wins _ in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leading in the national delegate race. The latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count put him at 740.55, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 704.55, uncommitted at 513.6, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 394.8 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 170.5 Even if he is not actively campaigning, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> could continue to gain delegates, and keep those he has. That would leave him in control of a delegate bloc that could give him some clout at the Democratic National Convention. Whether he meant it to or not, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to technically remain a candidate helps <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remain the leader in the delegate race. Under party rules, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is entitled to 47 at-large delegates from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to 13 and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> none. A Simon withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s column, and thus put him ahead in national delegate count.

<HEAD>Study Says Aging Baby Boomers May Run Out of Doctors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The aging baby boom generation may run out of doctors early in the next century as a widely predicted surplus of physicians turns into a shortage, according to reports released today. The authors of two reports, both published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, contend that a feared doctor glut wo n't happen But at least one of the experts who has forecast an overabundance of physicians says he is not ready to change his mind. Several studies during the past decade have forecast that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have too many doctors by the year 2000, and recommend that the nation train fewer of them. But now, with that date just 12 years away, there are signs that opinion may be swinging the other way. In one of today's reports, Drs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> predict that at best, there will be just enough doctors by 2000 but a mild shortage is possible. In the other, less detailed paper, Dr. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> looks into the early decades of the next century. `` It is entirely possible that for the majority of people who are alive today, there may be another shortage just when they will need doctors the most _ after 2011, the year in which the first of the baby boom generation will turn 65 and enter their retirement years,'' he concludes. In general, the doctors argue that the earlier predictions overstated the supply of doctors and underestimated the demand for their services. However, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said those predictions already have had an impact. `` Many college students are looking on medicine as an unpromising career, in part because they are being told that there is going to be a huge physician surplus,'' he said in an interview. `` That is undoubtedly one of the factors that has led to a sharp reduction in the number of applications to medical school,'' which have fallen 15 per cent since 1981. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>' report projects that 592,000 physicians will be needed by the turn of the century, and 585,000 will be available. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersdorf </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>, has been warning of a coming doctor glut for years. He said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>' study makes assumptions about physician supply and demand that may be wrong. `` I agree with the authors that the presumed projected oversupply should not act as a deterrent to choosing medicine as a career,'' <PERSON> Petersdorf </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, I am not prepared to state that an oversupply does not exist. The support for such an assertion is based on assumption and not on fact.'' One of the most widely quoted of the earlier projections was a report in 1980 of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> It predicted that in 2000, there will be 144,700 too many physicians. However, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said that and other predictions greatly overstated the supply of doctors. The biggest mistake was assuming that all of the nation's doctors will be treating patients. Instead, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said that about 93,000 of them will be administrators, teachers and researchers. Another miscalcuation, he said, was failing to take into consideration the impact of the growing proportion of female doctors, who, studies show, work about 10 percent fewer hours than their male counterparts. The researchers also did not foresee a movement to require resident physicians to work shorter hours in large teaching hospitals. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said the earlier predictions also made a mistake by assuming that the demand for physicians will remain constant. Instead, he said, the demand for care has been growing at an annual rate greater than 1 percent for several decades. The availability of new kinds of care, such as exotic imaging machines, transplants and genetic analysis, may speed up the demand for more doctors. Other factors that could increase demand, he said, include the increasing age of the population, wider medical insurance coverage and the AIDS epidemic.

 Discovery, scheduled to make the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight, is beset by persistent technical problems which could delay its scheduled Aug. 4 liftoff. In recent weeks, there have been troubles with fuel and oxidizer pumps, engine controllers and booster rocket insulation. `` We've always said Aug. 4 is the target, and like most targets, it's the bull's eye,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON>, deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center. But the technical troubles `` certainly are going to make that target a small bull's eye.'' `` I still think from where we are today, an August launch is achievable,'' he said. The problems have forced <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to delay the rollout of the shuttle to the launch pad by a week, from May 24 to June 1. Also delayed a week, until June 22, is a 20-second firing of Discovery's three main engines with the vehicle locked onto the pad <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said there are several days of contingency time built into the launch preparation after June 22, and `` although there are problems, we have n't given up on early August.'' A decision on whether to postpone could be made April 14 when senior <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> managers meet at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. However, officials said a launch date assessment might not be made until after technicians finish assembling the two soild fuel booster rockets in late May. The newest problem cropped up Tuesday: a faulty controller in one of Discovery's in-flight maneuvering engines. Replacement is expected to take two or three days. Workers also are removing and checking the high-pressure oxidizer turbopumps from each of the three main engines, a procedure that is taking several days. Earlier, the hydrogen fuel turbopumps in all three main engines had to be replaced after a defective weld was found in a non-flight pump. Technicians also are repairing several small areas on a segment of a solid fuel booster rocket. In these areas, insulation separated, or debonded, from the steel rocket casing either before or during shipment here from the Morton Thiokol plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Failure of a joint on one of Challenger's two solid fuel boosters caused the shuttle's explosion and loss of its seven crew members in January 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since then. The redesigned booster has undergone extensive redesign and successful test-firings in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Three more full-scale tests must be passed before the rocket is certified for flight. These are scheduled April 20, June 3 and July 6.

<HEAD>Study Shows Blood Growth Factor Useful in Cancer Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A protein that stimulates the body to produce blood cells may help doctors overcome a dangerous side effect of intensive chemotherapy when treating cancer patients, researchers said. The preliminary study is one of several under way to test the powers of a newly identified class of growth boosters called colony-stimulating factors. In the experiment, doctors from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> gave a growth factor to cancer patients who had also received bone marrow transplants and chemotherapy to fight advanced skin and breast cancer. Cancer drugs damage the bone marrow's ability to make white blood cells. Without enough of the disease-fighting cells, patients may fall victim to life-threatening infections. The goal of the latest treatment was to restore patients' blood counts with transplanted doses of their own bone marrow, gathered before the chemotherapy started, as well as injections of one kind of colony-stimulating factor. The researchers found that the cancer patients' levels of white blood cells recovered dramatically, and that the treatment `` may be useful in reducing the toxicity of high-dose chemotherapy.'' The study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, was conducted on 19 patients and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. In the research, doctors used a naturally occurring protein, produced through gene splicing, that is called recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. At <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaconess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Groopman </PERSON> has used the same growth factor to boost blood cell levels in AIDS patients. He said he believes the proteins will have broad applications in treating cancer patients. `` Low white count leading to infection occurs in a number of different malignancies,'' <PERSON> Groopman </PERSON> said. `` I think at the least it will make it more manageable and help support cancer patients.'' He said the treatment may also allow doctors to use higher doses of cancer-killing drugs so that patients will have longer remissions. `` The longer-range goal,'' he said, `` would be to improve the cure rate in certain cancers.'' In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nienhuis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> researchers `` have achieved an important objective'' by showing what dose of growth factor can be used safely. He added that the availability of the factors `` seems destined to launch a new therapeutic era for those concerned with the treatment of patients with bone marrow failure.''

 Two young hooded seals that beached themselves earlier this year are now healthier and in need of a new permanent home, but finding one is n't as easy as calling a zoo. Wookie and Sweet Pea may be adorable seal pups now, but they eventually will become rather ferocious adults weighing more than 700 pounds each, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON>, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center. In addition, a zoo or aquarium must have the proper refrigerated pool to keep the seals comfortable, he said. `` I'm afraid this is a passing-through facility only,'' he said of the non-profit center he runs. The two female seals beached themselves on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in late January and early February, <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said. Wookie was sickly and bald; Sweet Pea was extremely ill and emaciated. Both had bronchial infections that took weeks to clear, <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said. The seals have regained their strength, fat and rambunctious energy, barking at each other and romping in the center's pool, he said. Now they must find a colder home `` or else I'll have to start buying a lot of ice cubes,'' he said. `` Refrigeration is not so much the problem at this point, but we start seeing stranded porpoises and sperm whales this time of year,'' <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said. `` There's no way I can put them in with the hooded seals. ... These seals are not known for their friendliness.'' He said that releasing the seals to the wild would also be a poor solution because they have become fairly docile. Sweet Pea is estimated to be only a few months old and eats only when hand-fed. Wookie, believed to be about a year old, has bald spots and could not survive sunburn, her rocky native coast of <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> or skirmishes with other animals, <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said. Hooded seals, named for the fleshy snouts of the adult males, normally are never found south of <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said. That made them 1,500 miles off course when the reached <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` It's like us planning to go to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and winding up in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> instead,'' he said. He said the ideal situation would be to find a benefactor sympathic to the plight of the stranded seals and other stranded marine mammals who would donate enough money to build a nearby facility for them. `` It would be a great tax writeoff, and we'd even name the place after them,'' <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said, only half-jokingly. The marine specialist has contacted an animal placement agency in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that spread the word about the seals. In the past two weeks, however, no one has expressed an interest. `` We're not trying to find just anyplace _ we want the animals to go somewhere where they will be cared for properly,'' <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said. `` I want somewhere that has federal permits to handle these animals, not a roadside attraction.''

<TEXT>
 No butts about it, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s smokers are now officially prohibited from smoking in many of their old haunts. `` No Smoking'' signs went up across town Wednesday as restaurants and other public places moved into compliance with the city's new anti-smoking law. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, city health commissioner, hailed the new law on its first day. `` We're protecting the health of the people of the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said as he posted a sign depicting the Big Apple and a crossed-out cigarette at the <ORGANIZATION> Tapis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> bistro on <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Goutal </PERSON>, the bistro's owner and a former smoker, said he likes the new law and may expand it to all of his 65-seat restaurant. Currently, he has set aside half his tables for non-smokers, as the new law requires. The measure restricts smoking in workplaces, restaurants, hotels, theaters, large stores and taxicabs. Employers and businesses have begun to comply, although <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said enforcement wo n't begin for two months. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said that would give smokers 60 days to quit `` cold turkey.'' There was no grace period at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which has snuffed out smoking in all its offices. `` It's going to drive people mad,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cundari </PERSON>, a city desk assistant who planned to leave the premises every few hours to smoke. `` You feel like you're in school. Then, you snuck into the bathroom and if they smelled it, you were in trouble,'' she said. `` It's horrible.'' Tensions also ran high among some restaurant owners. `` I have customers who've come here for 25 years and they are on a certain table. Now, they say, ` If I can not have my table, I'm not coming,' `` lamented <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Soltner </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Lutece </LOCATION>. `` How can I please everybody? It's a nightmare.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, owner of Club 1407 in the garment district, said: `` My complaint is that it's the restaurateur's job to become the policeman.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Camillucci </PERSON>, general manager of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, which phased in separate sections over the past three months, said most of his customers are understanding. `` I guess maybe it's the flexibility of good old New Yorkers.'' Smokers still light up wherever they please at the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>. The law exempts tobacco businesses, including an annex of the <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> building. `` In that area, common courtesy and accommodation and consideration will prevail,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> is mailing city businesses more than 81,000 pamphlets detailing the new law, as well as some 225,000 booklets to smokers' households. `` We're going to continue to let smokers know that you can still smoke in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. The literature says smokers have the green light in private, enclosed offices; enclosed areas of restaurants, hotels, motels and convention halls being used exclusively for a private function; bars; restaurants with 50 or fewer seats and retail stores that accommodate fewer than 150 people, if they post signs saying it's permitted; and in other specially designated areas Smoking has been limited in all city buildings since June 25, 1986, when the mayor issued an executive order. When enforcement of the new law begins, businesses that fail to comply can be fined from $ 100 to $ 500. Individuals can be fined $ 50 per violation.

 A three-story, 16-room castle owned by onetime motivational entrepreneur <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is going on the auction block, with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and other creditors splitting the proceeds. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 53, created a $ 300 million empire in the 1970s by selling distributorships in his Dare to be Great and Koscot International companies. But his empire collapsed after state and federal investigators accused him of operating pyramid schemes that bilked thousands of investors. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, imprisoned in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> prison for fraud, has owed the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> millions of dollars in back taxes for more than a decade, and the agency has succeeded in foreclosure proceedings against the property in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The unfinished castle, its boathouse, stables and surrounding 79 acres will be sold to the highest bidder after a federal court hearing April 26, according to court documents. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, which had a $ 15 million claim, has been awarded a judgment of $ 9.275 million, but appraisals put the value of the Turner property at $ 1 million to $ 2 million. Before the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> gets its share, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has the right to collect $ 16,900 in unpaid property taxes for 1987, said county Tax Collector <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. Private investors also have claims against the property for $ 200,000 in tax certificates, under which they paid the taxes and earn 18 percent interest until the property is sold and the tax amounts are paid back to them.. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and his family have n't paid property taxes since 1979, but investors bought tax certificates equal to the back taxes each year <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> documents in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> indicate there are dozens of other Turner creditors, but it is unlikely they will be paid from any proceeds from the Castle's sale, officials said. Bids on the Castle property will be advertised over the next few weeks to notify any other bidders of the pending sale. The castle and boathouse have been vacant for several years, and the castle has been used only for tours by the public for charitable events. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> sharecropper and a self-styled country boy, rose to fame in the early 1970s through inspirational speeches that promised great wealth if people bought distributorships in his operations. The companies collapsed in 1973 under lawsuits filed by investors and investigations by state and federal agencies. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and a partner, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rector </PERSON>, 57, were sentenced to seven years in prison in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in August on charges of operating a pyramid scheme there and defrauding investors through a self-motivational company called <ORGANIZATION> Challenge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Boston University Demands King's Widow Surrender All His Writings</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, declaring that it owns all of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s papers, has asked a court to order the widow of the slain civil rights leader to surrender the documents to the school. The university made the demand Wednesday in a counterclaim filed in response to <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s suit seeking the return of 83,000 documents her husband gave the school four years before his death. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> Trustee <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose law firm is defending the university in the suit, refused comment on the case, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, one of Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s lawyers, said he had not reviewed the university's counterclaim. The university argues that it not only owned the documents in its possession, but also any other documents written by or collected by <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who was assassinated 20 years ago this week. The university asked for a court order requiring Mrs. King to surrender all her husband's papers, contending that she violated <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s pledge to BU and had `` wrongfully detained and converted the remainder of Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s papers.'' <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> also seeks damages, attorneys' fees and an inventory of any King's papers that are in her possession or at the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In her suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. King requests that BU be ordered to give the King papers it has to the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> center, which was established in 1968 and contains more than 100,000 documents belonging to King. The BU collection contains speeches, sermons, letters and photographs from the 1950s and 1960s, including the outline for his famous `` I Have a Dream'' speech delivered at a 1963 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, rally. King, assassinated in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> on April 4, 1968, wrote in a July 1964 letter that the collection would become <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> property following his death. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, however, claims her husband privately indicated he wanted his papers stored permanently in the South. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> also accused BU of damaging her husband's papers by mishandling them. In its response to her suit, <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> contended that any damage to the papers was caused by King, Mrs. King or their associates. Central to the case is a one-page, typewritten letter dated July 16, 1964, from King to the BU library. King, who received his doctorate in theology from <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> in 1955, wrote that the library would be `` the repository of my correspondence, manuscripts and other papers.'' `` In the event of my death, all such materials deposited with the university shall become from that date the absolute property of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in the letter. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> contends the letter made it legal owner of the documents when <PERSON> King </PERSON> died. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> and her attorney contend the letter is not binding. They also have noted that King never followed through on a pledge in the letter to make annual gifts to the university from the collection.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> put pressure on Contra negotiators participating in cease-fire talks in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> by threatening to launch a major military offensive against the rebels if the talks break down. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also said Contra leaders in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for peace talks will not be allowed freedom of movement to talk with internal opposition leaders until rebel fighters have moved into designated cease-fire zones. The president of the leftist government spoke Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> and Contra military leaders reported making progress in technical cease-fire talks they planned to resume today in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, an outpost on the Costa Rican border. Key issues on bringing about a lasting peace have yet to be negotiated. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> launched an offensive against the U.S.-supported Contras in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last month. On President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s orders, 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops flew to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on March 17-18 after Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had invaded his country in pursuit of Contras The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops never saw action and returned home at the end of March. Finishing their fourth technical meeting, the military negotiators in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreed on seven zones in which Contra fighters are to gather by April 15 _ two each in the north, central and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and one in the south. Still to be worked out are details for the combatants' security, the key issue of what needs to occur before the Contras lay down their arms. The two sides also agreed to postpone until April 15 a high-level meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> and Sandinista political leaders. Those talks had originally been scheduled for Wednesday. `` If the Contras do n't accept the agreements, the people must be ready for combat and ... launch an offensive with all available force to be rid of -LRB- the Contras -RRB- once and for all and not prolong the war,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told farmworkers at an agricultural cooperative in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` We have to fight so the -LRB- peace -RRB- agreements work, but for the agreements to work we can not let down the defense of the country,'' he said in the remarks carried by state-run Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Both the political and technical cease-fire discussions are part of a preliminary peace agreement the two sides signed on March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. The accords put into effect a 60-day truce last Friday that aims to give negotiators time to arrange an end to their six-year war. In his speech, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leaders who come to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for the high-level talks will be restricted in their travel in the country until the rebels have moved into the cease-fire zones. `` They can come to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` but to the meeting _ nothing more.'' The Contras have been pressing for permission to move about freely during their stay, saying they want to meet with opposition groups. They also have accused the Sandinistas of violating a provision of the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> accords calling for `` unrestricted freedom of expression'' by not supplying newsprint to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> did not publish Wednesday and its publisher, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, told a news conference that the newsprint restriction was `` a deliberate blow to freedom of expression in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The Sandinistas, who control the importation and distribution of Soviet newsprint, say a shipment has been delayed. The Sapoa accords do not directly deal with the issue of a Contra surrender of arms, of what will happen to rebel fighters after they move to the designated zones and the cease-fire expires. The Contras maintain they will not lay down their arms until they are assured of full democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The government says the putting down of weapons is `` indispensable'' to the truce's success. The peace pact says the government pledges that `` individuals who have been reintegrated into normal civilian life'' will be able to take part in future elections. But `` normal civilian life'' is open to interpretation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the government claims to have 300,000 people under arms. In complying with the accords, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> on March 27 freed 100 political prisoners. The Contras say only 10 of the prisoners they requested were released. The pact does not give the rebels a say in who is freed. Both sides declared a truce March 21 at the start of the talks that led to the peace plan.

 Police searched today for two teen-age suspects in the shooting of Grammy Award-winning jazz guitarist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, who was wounded when he apparently surprised intruders at his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, 40, was in serious but stable condition today at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> after undergoing four hours of surgery, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. Police say he was wounded in the neck Wednesday afternoon after he apparently encountered intruders in his hillside home in the exclusive <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> area, 10 miles northwest of downtown. Detectives were looking for two teen-agers between the ages of 14 and 17. `` They were seen with a small German shepherd puppy,'' said police Detective <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>. `` We have no description of any vehicles. All we know is they fled on foot down the hill.'' <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>'s secretary was working at an office in the home when the shooting occurred. `` She has no idea why it happened. We have no motive at this time,'' <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> won a best pop instrumental performance Grammy this year for his version of the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' `` Minute By Minute,'' and shared the same award in 1981 with pianist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON> for their work on the `` Hill Street Blues'' theme. The musician toured with the Fifth Dimension vocal group during the 1960s and was a member of the Jazz Crusaders during the early 1970s.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hamdija </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozderac </PERSON>, who quit as vice president in September after being linked to the nation's biggest postwar financial scandal, died in <LOCATION> Sarajevo </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. He was 64. The official agency said <PERSON> Pozderac </PERSON> died in a hospital Wednesday `` as a result of a brain stroke which he suffered on March 29.'' He resigned the vice presidency Sept. 12, 1987, after his name was associated with the scandal surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Agrokomerc </ORGANIZATION>, a Bosnian food-processing company that issued more than $ 1 billion worth of uncovered bills of exchange. At the time, <PERSON> Pozderac </PERSON> said his resignation was of a `` principled nature.'' If he had stayed in office, he would have taken over <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s rotating presidency this May. <PERSON> Pozderac </PERSON>'s stance last September suggested he accepted no blame for the Agrokomerc scandal. Several Yugoslav media reports have suggested, however, that such fraud could not have taken place without the knowledge of <PERSON> Pozderac </PERSON> and other Bosnian Communist leaders. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON>, expressed condolences to the <PERSON> Pozderac </PERSON> family and praised <PERSON> Hamdija </PERSON> as a man `` who dedicated his life to socialism.'' Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> handed over to this island's military authorities two speed boats to be used to fight drug trafficking. The long, sleek boats were confiscated from traffickers trying to smuggle cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. They can reach speeds of 65 mph. Smugglers use this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation as a transit point for cocaine from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> bound for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> seems to be determined ... that narcotics trafficking should be totally eliminated,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Imbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, the armed forces minister, on Wednesday. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> spoke on the first day of a five-nation Latin American tour. He arrived by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet and was due to leave <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> today for <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also will visit <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> shares the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Drug runners have turned to the island as governments on the neighboring islands of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> tightened surveillance of boats and planes. President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>, elected to a fifth term in May 1986, has made the war on drugs a top priority. In December 1986, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> air force shot down a small plane that did not identify itself upon demand. Officials later said it was carrying hundreds of pounds of cocaine. In recent months, police and soldiers have seized cocaine shipments weighing hundreds of pounds and valued at millions of dollars. But suspected smugglers in high-powered boats often outran the patrol boats of the Dominican coast guard. `` These -LRB- confiscated boats -RRB- are going to put the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> one step ahead of the smugglers,'' said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The boats were confiscated from traffickers apprehended while trying to smuggle drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. One is a 31-foot <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorpion </PERSON> with twin 235 horsepower Mercury engines and the other a 33-foot Sonic Carrera 33RX, he said. The value of the boats, delivered from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130s, was not disclosed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also plans to supply five small, twin-engined Cessnas to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> air force under the Military Assistance Program. Accompanying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were his wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>; the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for enforcement; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dion </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary; and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skol </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Andean Affairs.

 The Rust Belt is back, says Fortune magazine's latest annual list of the 500 biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial companies, which boomed to record profits and sales led by a resurgent smokestack <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> A weaker dollar is helping manufacturers battle fierce foreign competition, while economic fears raised by October's stock market crash have faded. `` Across the Rust Belt you can hear the sound of champagne corks popping and beer cans spritzing open: The Fortune 500 had its best year ever in 1987,'' the magazine said in a cover story on the annual list. `` After half a decade of sitting on the sidelines while the rest of the economy boogied, the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial corporations waltzed into the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Profit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with record sales and earnings,'' <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said. Fortune compiles the list of the 500 biggest industrial companies every year based on annual sales of the previous year. The list is in Fortune's April 25 issue, available at newsstands Monday. Fortune said total sales of the 500 climbed 9 percent last year to $ 1.88 trillion, up from $ 1.72 trillion in 1986 and higher than the previous record of $ 1.81 trillion in 1985. Profits jumped from $ 64 billion to $ 91 billion, a 41 percent increase that gave the 500 its biggest share ever of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial profits, <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said. The magazine attributed the performance to free-spending consumers unconcerned with the stock market collapse, corporate restructuring that has reduced work forces, and the weak dollar that has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive. The most powerful catalysts in the smokestack revival, the magazine said, were basic industries such as forest products and chemicals, which enjoyed the best advantage from the dollar's protracted decline Among paper makers, median sales increased 17.9 percent and median profits increased 60 percent. Profits at No. 183 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of industrial gases, rose more than 30-fold to $ 155.6 million, making it the biggest profit gainer on the list. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> returned to the top 10 for the first time in a decade, helped by its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The top six companies were unchanged from the previous year: <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, No 7, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, No. 8, swapped places from the year before. E.I. du Pont de Nemours repeated in the No. 9 spot and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was bumped out of No. 10 by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s ascent from No. 11. This year's list contained fewer members of industries such as building materials, food, industrial and farm equipment, petroleum refining, rubber products, toys and sporting goods. There were more companies producing chemicals, computers, furniture, metals, drugs and cosmetics. Newcomers to the list included <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> computer maker founded six years ago by four 27-year-olds, which debuted at No. 463 after a 156 percent increase in sales and 300 percent jump in profits. Also thundering into the pack at No. 398 was motorcycle manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION>, which modernized its factories and adopted Japanese-style production methods during the mid-1980s.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today asked King Fahd to rally <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> support for his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who arrived today, also was expected to discuss the Saudis' purchase of long-range Chinese missiles. There were few public signs that either <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was willing to accept <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s initiative. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> looked to the Saudi king to try to generate support within the Arab world for a two-step plan for negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The Saudis, whose oil wealth is used to support <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly have affirmed that they support a role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in any peace talks. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> until it recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounces terrorism. After his meeting with <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to return to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to meet again with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. He met with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> Wednesday after apparently failing to win over <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed last week Ambassador <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horan </PERSON> has been withdrawn, six months after he took up his post in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, the Saudi capital. No clear reason has been cited for his recall. But it was widely believed that <PERSON> Horan </PERSON> was not considered welcome in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> following his protests over the Chinese missile deal. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> stressed that it had not requested his transfer. The Saudis evidently bought the CSS-2 missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, keeping the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the dark, as a hedge against attack by fundamentalist <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has called for the overthrow of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal family. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has expressed concern because the missiles can be fitted with nuclear warheads. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accepted <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> assurances the missiles are not nuclear-tipped. The American official said <PERSON> Horan </PERSON>'s troubles with the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> were personal and not political. He did not explain. The official briefed reporters aboard <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plane on condition of anonymity. A new ambassador, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, was expected to be named by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shortly, the official said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also assured the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that it would not launch a pre-emptive strike against the missiles. Israeli leaders have warned that the missile has a range of 1,850 miles, enough to reach their country, with which <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and most of the Arab world is technically in a state of war. <LOCATION> Pro-Israeli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators have moved to block <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> bought the missiles in frustration over repeated attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to block <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> arms sales. The missile purchase has stirred a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to carry out a one-year agreement with Western allies to keep intermediate-range rockets out of the hands of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and other countries in the region. While <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is not a direct party in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> seeks, the official said the Saudis would be invited if they wished to attend. The possible participants are <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There were few public signs that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was willing to embrace <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s initiative following his apparent failure to win over <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Chants of `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> go home'' echoed through the <PERSON> Jebel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> early today as 200 Palestinians staged an illegal march to protest the visit. Jordanian newspapers sharply criticized <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s refusal of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands for an independent state or complete <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from lands captured in 1967. `` He should understand that his peace mission is a flop,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sawt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ash-Shaab </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. At the halfway point in his second <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour in a month, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday he was still committed to making his plan work. `` In all candor, I am not able to say that it is happening,'' he said. `` While we have made some progress, differences have not been substantially narrowed.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> ended his visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Wednesday without overcoming <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s opposition to his call for an international peace conference or to the concept of surrendering land captured in 1967 in return for peace. More than 135 Arabs, one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and one Israeli settler have been killed in four months of anti-occupation rioting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> then flew to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who reasserted his support for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Asked to Cancel Recall Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is being asked to cancel the May 17 gubernatorial recall election now that the target, Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, is no longer in office. Meanwhile, a county court judge cleared the way Wednesday for the new governor, <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mofford </ORGANIZATION>, to appear on the ballot if the election is held. Both the suit and the favorable ruling were sought by supporters of Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who took office in her own right after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment court on Monday. A suit filed by <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> residents <PERSON> Elinor </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to order acting Secretary of State <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> to cancel the recall vote. `` The removal of the governor from office by impeachment, and the swearing in of a new governor ... render the recall election unnecessary and improper,'' said complaint said. The lawsuit was filed after negotiations involving Mofford's chief of staff, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, his law partner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Maledon </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> The plaintiffs' attorney, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, said they were challenging the recall as taxpayers who believe the cost is unnecessary. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> would not say who was paying the cost of the lawsuit. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> issued a non-binding opinion saying that even if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> were removed from office the election must go forward. `` There's nothing in the constitution that says the recall election stops'' if the governor is removed, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. Recalls technically are aimed at the office, not the officeholder, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has avoided talking about the possibility of being a candidate in the recall election because of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s `` resign to run'' law. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to hear arguments on Tuesday. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he hopes for an early decision because absentee balloting is scheduled to begin April 14, two days later. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Mecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which filed almost 400,000 petition signatures seeking the recall vote, said he supports Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> but still believes the recall should be held because `` you will never put the issue to rest until the people have a chance to vote.'' `` I think it's shameful that someone would attempt to overthrow the constitution and cut out an election ... That's the kind of thing you do in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> _ you try to cancel elections. You do n't cancel elections in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Londen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told a Republican audience in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> Wednesday night he hoped to announce by Friday whether he will attempt to run in the recall or try to appeal his impeachment conviction to a federal court. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> and others have said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is no longer entitled to be on the recall ballot. In <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martone </PERSON> rejected a challenge to the draft campaign that put Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> on the ballot before she became governor in her own right. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, the former secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, became acting governor when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 5. Plaintiff <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a Democratic party activist, had contended that Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> must file financial statements as other candidates are required to do. <PERSON> Martone </PERSON> ruled, however, that financial statements are not required in a recall election, and that Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> would not have to file one in any case because she was nominated without her formal consent.

 <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s lawyers have demanded access to personal records of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> national security aide <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> contends plotted to ruin him because of his opposition to aid to the Contras. Their subpoena was revealed Wednesday at a hearing into whether prosecutors withheld from <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> lawyers evidence supporting defense claims that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other government agencies harassed and infiltrated <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> groups. The subpoena was issued Friday. Because of disputes over defense access to classified records discussing possible infiltration, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> on Wednesday delayed resumption of testimony in the case to April 19 at the earliest. The jury has been in court only one of the past five weeks. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> political organizations are charged with conspiring to stymie a federal grand jury investigation of alleged credit card and loan fraud by fund-raisers for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign. Four of the organizations are charged with fraud. The trial began in December and is expected to last up to a year. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who is seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, contends evidence of fraud and obstruction was fabricated by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents in his organizations. He says <PERSON> North </PERSON> was behind the plot because of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s opposition to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The North subpoena demands that he surrender any documents in his possession that mention the defendants, government witnesses or three intelligence operatives who told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> they were asked by top <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials to infiltrate <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizations. To support the subpoena, defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> cited a memo in which retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> told North of an apparent effort to collect information against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. North and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> have been indicted for their roles in the Iran-Contra scandal. <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers have agreed to accept the subpoena but have indicated they will ask <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> to quash it. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who represented <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings, did not return telephone calls seeking comment Wednesday. He was not available to come to the telephone, his secretary said. Since the disclosure of the <LOCATION> Secord-North </LOCATION> memo a month ago, the defense has pressed for access to a wide range of government files, most of them classified. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> ruled last week that seven classified <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files contained information that should be given to defense lawyers. He said Wednesday that an additional five classified <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files contained material relevant to the defense, involving an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant who also has worked for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has refused to declassify the files on grounds they would expose high-level intelligence sources and possibly endanger national security. The defense lawyers have demanded that they be allowed to see the classified files under a protective order that would prohibit them from discussing their contents. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> is to consider the issue Monday.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> was quoted as saying today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed to continue aid to the warring sides in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, so a peace accord can be signed `` any time.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Pakistani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> as telling Parliament: `` According to unofficial reports, the two superpowers have agreed on the symmetry under which both would be able to provide continued assistance to their respective allies in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' The issue of a cutoff of aid to the U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas and the Soviet-backed Afghan government has stalled the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> peace talks. The Soviets have rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that the cutoff be simultaneous. The Soviets say their aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s government ca n't be compared to foreign aid to the insurgents, and they maintain the issue is outside the scope of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. The news agency's report did n't elaborate on the `` unofficial reports'' that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> mentioned. It quoted the president as saying that `` the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord could now be signed any time.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> also was quoted as saying that his country would continue providing humanitarian assistance to the estimated 3.5 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> until they can return home with `` dignity and honor.'' According to the report, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has not provided military assistance to the Afghan guerrillas, will not do so in the future. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to carry out that task. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s `` old ally'' with which it enjoyed positive relations, the report said. The <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> situation had brought the two countries close, the president was quoted as saying. On relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said there was no dispute between the two countries. `` With the resolution of the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> issue, friendship between the two countries would be strengthened. There exist avenues for it,'' the news agency quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> also praised the Soviet leadership which, he said, had `` carried forward possibilities of friendship.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> also thanked individuals who he said had contributed to reaching an Afghan settlement. In particular, he noted <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the mediator in the U.N.-sponsored peace talks, and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. He also praised the Western press, which he said had played a `` commendable role'' in keeping the Afghan issue alive.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> bombed each other's capitals and other towns today in one of the fiercest exchanges in their `` war of the cities. Scores of people were reported killed and wounded. The deadly duel erupted at dawn after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said squadrons of its warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> twice in the first air raids on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital in more than two years. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said only one Iranian jet got through to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and was shot down by an Iraqi interceptor inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after being driven away from the capital by heavy anti-aircraft fire. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> then loosed six long-range missiles against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the cities of <LOCATION> Karaj </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION>, the agency reported. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also reported bombing the northern Iraqi city of <LOCATION> Erbril </LOCATION> and the southern ports of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and Umm Qasr. The sudden escalation overshadowed talks to resume in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, on efforts to arrange a cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is determined more than ever to punish this criminal regime in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for its aggression,'' <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said after a meeting Wednesday, indicating little change in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s refusal to accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s July 20 cease-fire resolution. Today's sharp upsurge in hostilities came on the eve of parliamentary elections in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Officials fear the Iraqis will launch a missile blitz when voters go to the polls Friday. Both sides reported scores of civilians killed or wounded in today's missile attacks on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and other cities as well as air raids and artillery bombardments. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said Iranian jets penetrated `` sophisticated radar and anti-aircraft defenses'' ringing the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital to `` heavily bomb selected targets.'' It said the first raid at 6:05 a.m. scored `` accurate hits.'' Another formation of fighter-bombers streaked above the city of 5 million people 10 minutes later, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said all the jets returned safely to their bases, but did not say how many were involved in the attacks or give any details of their targets. Although <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said only that one Iranian jet got through to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and was shot down, the ferocity and scale of the Iraqi bombardment indicated that the Iranian claim was probably true. It was one of the most widespread missile barrages the Iraqis have unleashed since the latest bout of the `` war of the cities'' exploded Feb. 29. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Iraqi warplanes also bombed <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> and other cities in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In retaliation, the Iranians said they fired two missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and battered ports of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and Umm Qasr, an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> naval base, with 13 short-range missiles. <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and other Iraqi border cities were hammered with artillery fire, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said that other formations of Iranian warplanes attacked <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troop concentrations in <LOCATION> Al-Amara </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, and other areas in the southern front, `` inflicting heavy losses.'' The Iranians have had some 250,000 men massed east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> for weeks. But despite repeated air raids on <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> defenses, they have made no move to launch a long-awaited offensive against the city. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> said two Iranian warplanes also bombed the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Erbil </LOCATION>, killing several civilians. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian fighter-bombers also attacked a headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, an Iraqi-based dissident movement seeking to topple the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> regime, in the northern <LOCATION> Diyala </LOCATION> region, `` destroying all their targets.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s air force has been badly depleted by combat losses and a chronic shortage of spare parts. Outnumbered by around 8-to-1 by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s powerful air force, it has not raided <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> since early 1986. But in recent months it has become increasingly aggressive. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranian air raids `` completely caught the enemy by surprise.'' It said the warplanes destroyed <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military basses in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, `` killing or wounding dozens of soldiers.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s air force commander, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattari </PERSON>, as saying the bombing raids were `` unique and very valuable militarily.'' He did not elaborate. Half of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s 6 million people have fled the capital since Feb. 29. Both sides have fired nearly 300 missiles into each other's cities, killing hundreds on both sides.

<HEAD>Rebels Condemn Ethiopian Order to Expel Relief Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Ethiopian rebel group charged today that the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government was trying to starve people by ordering foreign relief workers to leave the war-torn and drought-plagued regions of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> calls on all charitable organizations and those cooperating with them to oppose the dergue's -LRB- <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> leadership's -RRB- inhuman step and to help the starving people in any way possible,'' the rebels' clandestine radio station said in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s central government Wednesday told international relief agencies to recall all their foreign workers in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> `` to avoid personnel security risks'' from rebels. The government asked donors and the relief agencies to turn over their operations to the <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency responsible for drought and famine relief. The rebel radio said the order was intended `` to starve the people of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON> and cow them into submission. `` For this purpose, the dergue intends to put the charitable organizations' food, vehicles and other services to military use,'' the broadcast said. Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the central government in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. It is <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war. In neighboring Tigre, another separatist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has been fighting for 14 years. The fighting has disrupted relief efforts in both regions, where crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation. Overall, nearly 7 million Ethiopians are facing famine without outside help. There are about 60 non-governmental relief organizations working in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but only a few operate in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre.

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> man who offered no defense on charges of directing an attempted contract murder that began with a Soldier of Fortune magazine advertisement was quickly convicted by a federal court jury. Jurors deliberated for about 1 -LCB- hours Wednesday before reaching the verdict against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>. `` The evidence was overwhelming,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAnda </PERSON> told the jury after it convicted Savage on all seven counts in a federal indictment. Savage, 39, was accused of arranging attempts on the life of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Free </PERSON>, including the Oct. 12, 1985, grenade bombing of a Houston-area home. Free escaped that attack and two previous attempts in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to bomb his car. The trial began Monday and prosecutors rested their case Wednesday. Defense attorneys did not call any witnesses. Court-appointed defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he chose not to present testimony because of <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s prior criminal convictions and a similar trial he faces in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he plans to challenge one of the counts against <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> because he believes it charges him twice for the same offense. <PERSON> DeAnda </PERSON> set sentencing for May 20. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> could receive as much as 40 years in prison and fines totaling $ 1.75 million. Savage was indicted in 1986 on federal charges he accepted $ 20,000 from a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> woman, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brado </PERSON>, to arrange the death of Free, and later carried out attempts to have Free killed. Ms. <PERSON> Brado </PERSON> claimed Free absconded with her $ 300,000 life savings. She found <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> through a `` Gun for Hire'' an ad in Soldier of Fortune, according to the indictment. Ms. <PERSON> Brado </PERSON> pleaded guilty and died while serving a five-year prison term in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Three other people named in the indictment have pleaded guilty, and testified that <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> directed the operation from <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Savage is serving a 40-year <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state prison term for arranging the beating death of the former assistant city manager of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in an attack arranged through a Soldier of Fortune advertisement He also has been sentenced to 25 years in a federal prison for an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> conviction for attempted murder-for-hire and threatening a witness. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s trial was moved from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, due to publicity from an unrelated civil suit in which a jury in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> found Colorado-based Soldier of Fortune negligent and awarded $ 9.4 million to the family of a woman killed in a contract arranged through an advertisement in the magazine.

<TEXT>
 The 65 mph speed limit appears to be partially to blame for a nearly 50 percent increase in traffic deaths on rural interstates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the first state to raise its limit a year ago, an official says. Ninety-five accidents resulting in 110 deaths were reported on rural stretches of interstate highways in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> between April 2, 1987, the day the law went into effect, and March 31. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Graff </PERSON>, chief planner of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said 64 crashes resulting in 74 deaths were reported for the corresponding period the previous year. `` My opinion is that it looks like -LRB- the new limit -RRB- has had an effect,'' <PERSON> Graff </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Rural interstates are supposed to be the safest of roads, with wider shoulders, medians and all that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> released figures last summer indicating traffic fatalities increased nationwide about 50 percent within three months of the new speed limit taking effect. States were allowed to boost speed limits to 65 only on interstate highways outside urban areas. <PERSON> Graff </PERSON> said traffic deaths in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> more than doubled in the first three months after the increase, but stabilized during the winter. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauersdorf </PERSON>, a highway safety specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said it is too early to detect a trend nationally. `` My own personal observation is that there are some places where you can do 65 and no one passes you with the exception of the occasional leadfoot, and there are others where, if you go 65, everyone's going by you,'' he said. `` It just does n't seem to be consistent in any way.''

 A white South African member of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was seriously injured today when a bomb exploded as he opened his car door, the national news agency reported. AIM said <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a lawyer who works for <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, apparently was on his way to the beach when the bomb exploded under his car about 9:20 a.m. in the central <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> neighborhood of <PERSON> Polana </PERSON> The explosion nearly severed <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>' right hand from his arm, turned his car into a twisted hunk of scrap and hurled it three yards from the street onto the sidewalk, the news agency said. AIM said a child playing nearby and a man driving by in his car were slighlty injured. The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the major guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. No one claimed responsibility for the bombing. The explosion shattered windows of the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Portuguese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, knocked branches of trees and apartment block windows into the street and hurled pieces of the car as much as 50 yards, AIM said. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> was rushed to a hospital where he was in serious condition, AIM reported. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, in his 50s, was imprisoned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the 1960s and left the country after his release. He wrote a book about his experiences, `` The Prison Diary of <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> lectured in law at the university in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, and recently joined the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, where he was drafting a new family law for <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, AIM said. The attack is the latest in a series carried out against <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members outside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. At least six congress members have been killed in countries outside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year, and there were two car bombings involving congress victims, in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, in 1987. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has denied responsibilty for the deaths, but repeatedly has said it will cross its borders in pursuit of congress members. A congress representative in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dulcie </PERSON> <PERSON> September </PERSON>, was shot to death on March 29; the day after the South African army confirmed it had raided a house in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, killing three women and a man. The South Africans said the four were `` <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> terrorists,'' but the <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> government said the three women were <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> citizens, and the man was a South African refugee who had been in the country since 1979.

 Thousands of Jewish settlers, some shouting `` Revenge! Revenge!'' attended the funeral today for an Israeli girl stoned to death by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villagers. Earlier, settlers attacked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> cars and homes. Under heavy army guard, settlers carrying <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags strung with black ribbons buried 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, who was killed Wednesday during a clash between settlers and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villagers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. `` Near the fresh grave of <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, God will avenge her blood. The heart of all the people boils over,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told about 9,000 mourners. `` Every killing strengthens and unites the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> people, links it more to this land, deepens its roots here. The rioters and instigators will not achieve a thing. They are leading their people to tragedy,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was interrupted by cries of `` Revenge!'' and `` Expel the Arabs!'' Many in the crowd carried M-16 rifles or pistols. The body, wrapped in a black tarpaulin bearing a white Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>, was carried in a 25-minute procession from the Elon Moreh settlement, where the girl had lived, through the heart of the Arab city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and past several <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villages, to the Jewish cemetery in <PERSON> Karnei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian to die in four months of unrest in the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 140 Arabs have died, and one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier has been killed. Israeli troops shot and wounded two Arabs today during clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Fathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, 20, of the Beach refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was wounded in the chest and another 18-year-old Arab from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s Qabatieh was shot in the abdomen The army announced it had destroyed four <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> homes in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> belonging to villagers suspected of attacking the settlers. Thirteen Israelis were injured in the incident Wednesday. According to army accounts, it began after <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> stoned a group of teen-agers on a hike. Israeli guards accompanying the hikers fired on the stone-throwers, killing two Palestinians and wounding two, the army said. Arab witnesses said the clash was provoked by Israelis. They said the guards fired without provocation on Arab villagers and that the villagers then charged the Israelis. Justice Minister <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON> proposed demolishing houses in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> and expelling hundreds of villagers allegedly involved in the violence. Rabbi <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kiryat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arba </ORGANIZATION> settlement, echoed the call `` With an Arab village in which a pogrom on Israeli children takes place, there's nothing else to propose but to destroy all of the village, to wipe it out from the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces radio. Throughout the night and into this morning, settlers attacked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> homes and cars, despite appeals by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, armed forces chief of staff, not to retaliate for the slaying. Some called for <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents to be expelled to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and for authorization allowing soldiers to shoot anyone throwing stones. <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, who had a swollen lip and a cut on his face, told a reporter he was beaten up by settlers in the Arab village of <LOCATION> Hawwara </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. `` Every house on the main road is in danger of attack now. They want to retaliate. They want to kill us,'' he said. <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, 57, another resident, said `` everyone has clubs and stones but that is not enough to face guns. Settlers using guns come to humiliate us, but if we fight them, they will kill us.'' The Maariv daily reported that dozens of villagers identified as attackers by the Israeli teen-agers were detained Wednesday night. It said they included a woman and her daughter suspected of killing the girl to avenge the death of their cousin, who was killed during the clash. Army spokesmen declined comment on the report. The army announced it was extending the closure of Arab schools until May 8. The 850 Arab schools and five universities attended by 300,000 students have been closed since Feb. 4. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, speaking on armed forces radio, said that Arabs responsible for the attack had been arrested and would be punished. He did n't say how many were arrested, and he noted that some Arabs had tried to protect the Jewish teen-agers. Dozens of settlers held a vigil Wednesday near <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> and announced they would build a settlement at the site of the clash. Leading right-wing politicians such as former Defense Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> went today to <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreh </PERSON>. About 100 men and women gathered at the <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> home. Many of the men held M-16 rifles in their laps as they waited for the funeral to begin. Some wept.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, in an interview published today, was sharply critical of Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for his attacks on rivals <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said of the negative campaigning. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that he is unlikely to make an endorsement before his state's primary on April 19. `` The closer you get to primary day, the less reason'' there is to announce support for one of the candidates, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said, adding that he would prefer to remain neutral until after the final primaries. `` That's the time for leadership in this process,'' he said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, already important by virtue of the 255 delegates at stake in its primary, takes on an added significance because of the seesaw race being run by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The two have remained close in the national delegate count. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished a strong second in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary and had a major win in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came back with victories in the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> primary, the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses and the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he expects the contest between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` will be very close here.'' Noting that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had garnered 26 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vote in 1984, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> told the Post: `` You've got to give him 10 points more than that this year. I'd say, 35 to 40 percent is his base.'' The governor said his call to hold down negative campaigning was `` intended for all Democrats and specifically for <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has said both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lack experience in international issues, and has been particularly critical of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous and counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the nominee,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` You should not spend a lot of time criticizing your opponents, especially if you have not established your own identity in this state.'' Another politician who has been vocal in his criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said there was little he could do to get <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> to heed his call to tone it down. `` The mayor has already ignored it and will continue to. I have no hopes of conversion, short of his being struck in the tush by a bolt of lightning ... and I have no command over the lightning,'' he said. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he expected about 10 percent of the Jewish vote to go to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, despite the furor in 1984 over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown.'' `` Most of them -LRB- Jewish leaders <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> addressed last week -RRB- agreed with him that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should be defeated, but then the question comes: Are you, Mr. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the way to do it? The sophisticated ones, who read the polls, may decide the best way to do it is with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he expected black voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as they have elsewhere, to `` go overwhelmingly for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.''

 A man hospitalized since being left quadriplegic by a gun-fired nail that severed his spine two years ago has settled a lawsuit for $ 15.35 million and says he'll use some of the money to help him return home. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, an insurance agent and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, was getting a haircut at a barbershop in suburban <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> on April 15, 1986, when he was hit by a 3-inch nail fired from a high-velocity gun being used to install a storage chest next door. The settlement, reached Wednesday in the second day of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial and described as one of the largest of its kind in the nation, is to be paid by <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, its Andover franchise and makers of the nail gun, said <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>'s lawyers. `` Here's a guy who came through <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the Tet offensive unscathed only to be shot down while having his hair cut,'' said one of the lawyers, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>. The 40-year-old <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, who has been hospitalized since the accident, said he will use part of the money to fit his home with lifts and ramps. `` I'm just very relieved that one item _ a very important item _ is off our shoulders,'' said <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> here. The couple have three children. `` I really have never had much anger ... maybe because it was an accident,'' he said. `` I could n't even tell you the man's name who did it. I never asked. I have frustration at times ... and this has changed my family's life. I'm just glad it's over.'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, another lawyer representing <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, said the suit cited <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and a <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> franchise in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> for renting the gun after company headquarters ordered the units destroyed due to insurance liability problems. A memo was sent to all <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> company-owned rental centers a month before <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> was paralyzed, but the approximately 250 franchised outlets were not notified, the attorneys said. The worker, an uninsured part-time carpenter, thought he was working on a concrete-backed wall when he shot the nail at chest level. The nail traveled through wood and sheetrock before striking <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> in the side of the neck. The high-velocity nail-gun used a .22 - caliber cartridge to drive the nails at 700 to 800 feet a second, said The guns are no longer produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although low-velocity nail-guns are still in use, said <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>. The settlement is one of the top five lump-sum compensatory court settlements in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, research director at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verdict </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors court awards. According to the settlement, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> will pay approximately $ 11 million and about $ 3.25 million will be paid by the nail-gun manufacturers, <ORGANIZATION> Amca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Desa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Desa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of Bowling Green, <LOCATION> Ky </LOCATION>. The Andover franchise will pay the remaining sum. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, is based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` I think it is clear that there were very serious injuries to Mr. <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, decided in the best interests of all parties concerned to settle the case,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilrain </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. The company expects to recover the settlement costs from its insurers, <PERSON> Gilrain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Degange </PERSON>, manager of corporate services for <ORGANIZATION> Amca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said today the company would not comment on the settlement. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, manager of industrial relations for <ORGANIZATION> Desa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the company official authorized to comment was not in the office today.

 Prosecutors and defense attorneys say the trial of a polygamist leader and three others charged in the bombing of a Mormon chapel and a 13-day standoff with police will proceed much more quickly because of the dismissal of a conspiracy count. `` It relieves the government of proving a real complex count and makes the issues in the case much clearer,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Metos </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, said Wednesday. A pool of 170 potential jurors reported Wednesday to the courtroom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, where they received a 20-page questionnaire and heard the charges. The federal charges now include bombing, destruction of the <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with an explosive, use of a bomb, attempting to kill federal agents, assault on federal officers, possession of a bomb, possession of a sawed-off shotgun and two counts of use of a firearm. <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> is charged with all eight counts; polygamist leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> faces all but the shotgun-possession charge; <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who had not been charged with conspiracy, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> face the firearms, assault and attempted murder counts. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> is <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> is <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s son. Associate Utah Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> said Wednesday that state prosecutors would wait until after the federal trial to file homicide charges in the death of corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, killed during the shootout that ended the siege at the defendants' farm. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, appeared in court Wednesday in a buckskin coat emblazoned with a Mormon pioneer flag. His mother-in-law, Mrs. Singer, 44, was dressed all in white, including a white bow in her hip-length hair. `` It is turning into a nightmare,'' <PERSON> Metos </PERSON> said. `` I've done nothing but criminal law for 10 years, and I never saw defendants do anything like that to draw attention to themselves,'' he added. Although <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> granted the prosecution motion to strike the conspiracy count, he denied requests from all four defendants to separate their trials, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The judge did not rule on a motion by <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> that his trial should be moved out of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> because of the predominance of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which abandoned polygamy in 1890. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> has said he would rule on the issue during jury selection. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> has said he was chosen by God to gather the American Indians for the second coming of Christ.

 Police reported 210 arrests today as they ended a 13-hour sweep through gang-infested neighborhoods. In nearby <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, three people were wounded in what was believed to be a gang-related shooting. A task force of 260 officers scoured gang `` hot spots'' throughout <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Wednesday night and early this morning on a variety of charges, said police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. He said 128 of those arrested were suspected gang members. Police set up a mobile booking unit in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Memorial Coliseum just south of downtown, processing paperwork before taking the suspects to jail on buses. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said there were reports of gunfire during the night Wednesday, but there had been no gang-related shootings within the city. In <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, 10 miles northeast of downtown, three people were wounded during a drive-by shooting that police said may have involved gang members. Curly <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 26, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolley </PERSON>, about 20, and <PERSON> Wilferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogletree </PERSON>, no age given, all of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, were struck by shotgun pellets fired from a passing car, said <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Froistad </PERSON>. `` All we know is that a car came up and a passenger made some statements at three people standing on the sidewalk. The passenger then pointed a shotgun out the window and fired several rounds,'' <PERSON> Froistad </PERSON> said of the 9:20 p.m. attack. The three were taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ogletree </PERSON> suffered minor injuries, while <PERSON> Tolley </PERSON> was in serious but stable condition with wounds to his upper torso, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. More than 50 people have been killed and hundreds injured in gang-related violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the past year. Stepped-up efforts in the battle against gang violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> included a city finance committee's approval Tuesday of an additional $ 2.5 million for police to use in fighting gangs. The funding was expected to win final approval from the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. It would pay for 1,000 extra officers to be deployed in gang-infested areas and would cover police overtime costs in fighting gang violence.

I've been collecting music and songs from the old-time mountaineers for 20 years, so this is like an extension of that.'' <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>'s first `` Celebration Express'' segment on the show will come from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a look at cowboy poet <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. Another Denver segment will feature <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, who owns a barbecue restaurant and gives away an estimated 4,000 meals a year. `` He's a real inspiration,'' said <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>. `` He's doing this out of the goodness of his heart.

It's been a wonderful experience for me just in the short time I've done it. It's wonderful to search out these people and spend time with them. <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, who previously served as host of <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Fire on the Mountain'' series, is a musician, storyteller and historian who is helping to preserve the Appalachian musical heritage.

I played a 64-string dulcimer, which is made of spruce, in the cockpit of the Spruce Goose. It makes an interesting sound to play an instrument of the same wood as the room you're in.'' The Spruce Goose is the flying boat built by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> in World War II, now on display in a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> museum. <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> then went to <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to see <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON>, a musician noted for unusual folk instruments. `` He plays the Hawaiian slide guitar and the saz, which is a Turkish instrument with a long neck and six strings,'' said <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>. `` It gives a haunting sound. <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON> is a very tasteful musician who has mixed folk, country and rock.

<HEAD>Rival Shiite Factions Battle for Third Day, 18 Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shiite Moslem militias fighting for control of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> battled today with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons. Police said 18 people were killed and 27 were wounded. It was the third straight day of violence between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the umbrella organization for groups holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Thirty people have been killed and 61 wounded since Tuesday. A police spokesman said Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Amal fighters, backed by armored personnel carriers, were advancing slowly on <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>, a key <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> stronghold six miles south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> is the provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> controls <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>, then <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s remaining strongholds will also fall eventually,'' the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with police regulations. The official said Amal had seized 10 major towns and villages and that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> still held four hamlets in addition to <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>. He said Amal seized <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, a market town 18 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, in a `` sweeping attack'' before dawn. `` Rescue teams are searching the rubble of devastated houses for bodies,'' the spokesman said. Six Hezbollah fighters, their hands raised, walked out of a gutted house to surrender to Amal after the fall of <PERSON> Nabtiyeh </PERSON>. It has a population of 50,000 people, most of them Shiites. The battle for the town lasted several hours as <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters, holed up in a school belonging to the town's tiny Christian community, traded rocket-propelled grenades and mortar fire with the Amal militiamen. Tensions between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> have increased since Feb. 17 when <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> for the abduction in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marine officer Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> Amal rounded up dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members it accused of involvement in the kidnapping. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has denied the Amal allegations and accused the rival militia of `` harrassing the believers by searching for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy.'' The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, an underground group believed linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction He is one of nine Americans missing after being kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. American journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asssociated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held foreign hostage. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 A British passenger freed from a hijacked Kuwaiti jet in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was quoted today as saying that two of the hijackers offered her pillows and drinks and chatted with her daughters. An Austrian businessman also released said the seven gunmen were brutal when they seized the plane but later treated the hostages well. `` We did n't have time to be frightened, things happened so fast,'' British passenger <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefton </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an interview with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>. She spoke by telephone from the Hyatt Hotel in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> confirmed today that all 22 Britons on the plane, which has hijacked Tuesday on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, had been freed. The hijackers were still holding about 50 hostages, including three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family. They are demanding <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 convicted pro-Iranian extremists. Austrian <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON>, 53, who manages <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, was freed early today with 31 other passengers and crew members. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON> said the hijackers were armed with handguns and grenades. All wore masks. At the start of the hijack the crew members were forced to lie on the floor with their hands behind their heads, and some passengers were handcuffed, <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON> said. `` At this stage things were quite brutal,'' he said. `` But they told passengers repeatedly to be calm, not to worry. They were really very friendly to us. Some passengers got excited and needed oxygen. But they -LRB- the hijackers -RRB- kept reassuring us.'' Twelve British men were among 32 people released earlier today and had been taken to the <LOCATION> Hyatt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, where they were reported `` fit and well,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Irishman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieran </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Kelly </PERSON> and his wife, Nisran, also were freed. Mrs. <PERSON> Sefton </PERSON> and her daughters <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, 12, were among 10 British women freed by the hijackers on Wednesday and later contacted by the Daily Mail in repeatedly interrupted telephone calls. `` One minute I was asleep, the next I was being nudged in the ribs by my husband and I saw one of the hijackers in the aisle,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sefton </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` The hijackers were n't always within my view but I saw them and one said, ` Do n't worry. Keep quiet.' ... A couple of the hijackers spoke English and asked if we wanted pillows and drinks and things. They talked a bit to the children.'' Relatives of the Britons hijacked on the Bangkok-to-Kuwait flight were jubilant at the release of their loved ones. `` We are obviously very relieved,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillwell </PERSON>, businessman father of 23-year-old <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillwell </PERSON>, who was among those freed today. Speaking from his home at <PERSON> Ryde </PERSON> on the Isle of Wight off the southern English coast, the elder <PERSON> Stillwell </PERSON> added: `` It was an ugly situation. `` These hijackings often end peacefully but who can be sure? It has been a bad time. We are very pleased at the news. Now we are waiting for official confirmation, but that could take a long time.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillwell </PERSON>, a commercial photographer, had been returning from a six-month holiday in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> with his 19-year-old girlfriend <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON>, who also comes from the Isle of <PERSON> Wight </PERSON>. She was among the British women freed Wednesday. `` We felt so helpless,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, mother of British hostages <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>, 25. `` We have just been waiting from one news bulletin to the next, hoping and praying they would be released,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said from her home in the western English port city of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>, a graphics salesman, and <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>, a travel courier, had been vacationing in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

 A former Miss Minnesota-USA who gave up her title after being arrested for shoplifting has pleaded guilty but will not be convicted if she stays out of trouble and completes a counseling program, her attorney says. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolich </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION>, entered the plea to a charge of gross misdemeanor theft Wednesday in <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. Her attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmons </PERSON>, said she must take part in a county pretrial diversion program for first offenders that includes counseling and job assistance. If she successfully completes that program, all charges will be dismissed in a year, he said. <PERSON> Bolich </PERSON> was arrested on Jan. 22 at the <ORGANIZATION> Southdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb and charged with shoplifting a bathing suit, scarves and hairpieces valued at around $ 370, authorities said. She resigned as Miss Minnesota-USA on Feb. 8 and passed the title on to <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavrakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Apple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, first runner-up in the contest, who also withdrew before the Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> pageant after it was reported that she had pleaded guilty to shoplifting in 1986.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to review an appeals court ruling that a $ 5.7 million bank account controlled by the late <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> belongs to his religious movement, not to his 22 children. In a brief order issued without comment, the state's highest court let stand a 1st <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank acted properly in transferring the money to what was then the Nation of Islam, the movement founded by <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> died in February 1975 without executing a will, leaving open to question the control of bank accounts that had held $ 19.2 million in contributions from his followers. The rest of the money apparently was spent by <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> groups or <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON>'s relatives after his death. In 1986, a <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit judge ruled that <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON>'s seven legitimate and 15 illegitimate children should inherit the remaining money. The judge held that the funds were personal gifts to the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> movement. The appellate court disagreed, saying that <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> literature indicated the donations were to be used for `` the care of the poor and needy members.'' The Nation of Islam, founded by <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> in the 1930s, fragmented after his death. One group, led by one of <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON>'s sons, became known as the American <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, while a group led by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakham </PERSON> took over the name <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>

 Iranian workmen began refueling a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jetliner today after hijackers holding 50 hostages fired five shots at police and threatened to take off with near-empty tanks, the Iranian news agency said. The gunmen earlier threatened to blow up the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and demanded that the runway at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> be cleared, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said that the taxiway had been closed `` to prevent the plane from flying.'' `` Disciplinary and relief forces are on full alert while the situation is presently out of control and anything may happen at any moment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. It said an Iranian delegation in contact with the hijackers was advising them to `` keep cool.'' The shooting erupted after the hijackers demanded that the plane be refueled and allowed to take off for an undisclosed destination, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had refused. The agency did not mention any casualties in the gunfire. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that `` Iranian officials have announced they would supply the hijackers with food and fuel provided that the passengers and crew members be released.'' But the refueling went ahead without any release being reported. The hijackers have demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> free 17 convicted pro-Iranian extremists. A member of the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> royal family held on the plane appealed to Iranian authorities to provide the plane with fuel to take off. `` We're very tired and our brothers -LRB- the hijackers -RRB- are very serious in their threat to blow up the plane,'' <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> told the control tower by radio, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The Iranian agency said officials at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` urged the hijackers to give up their threats,'' The hijackers forced the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> airliner to land Tuesday after seizing it on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The hijackers, armed with grenades and guns, are holding about 50 hostages, including three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family. Fifty-seven people have been freed since the plane landed, including 32 released early today. Austrian passenger <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON>, released today, said the seven gunmen were brutal when they seized the plane but later treated the hostages well. British passenger <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sifton </PERSON>, who was freed Wednesday, said two of the hijackers had offered her pillows and drinks and chatted with her daughters. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Moayerri </PERSON>, as saying failure to negotiate an end to the hijack drama could `` God forbid, lead to unpredictable events.'' It quoted him as saying the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> negotiators sent to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> appeared to `` attach no importance to the lives of their own citizens'' aboard the plane. <PERSON> Moayerri </PERSON>, in charge of negotiating with the hijackers, was quoted as saying: `` While we're trying to put an immediate end to the hijacking, the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> delegation seems to have no authority to make any decision here.'' The hijackers warned in an ultimatum radioed to the <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> tower that they would blow up the jet if there was `` any threat against the plane'' by Iranian security forces, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not say if the hijackers indicated where they planned to fly to. The warning came after senior <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials at the airport said they would negotiate only after the remaining hostages still being held were released. The remaining hostages were believed to all be Arabs, including at least 30 Kuwaitis. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers declared in statement: `` We give the Kuwaitis until noon -LRB- 4:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- and if they do not give a positive reply to our demand, we will leave <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport. `` We warn that we will not tolerate any threat against the plane and declare we are ready to blow it up.'' Earlier today, the hijackers singled out the three members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family, two of them women, who they said will be among the first passengers `` to pay a dear price'' if <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> does not meet their demand. The hijackers are demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian extremists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in that <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state in 1983. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> rejected the demand, calling it `` blackmail.'' The nationality of the hijackers was not known. Hostages who have been freed said there are five or six hijackers, all wearing masks. Twenty-four female hostages were released on Wednesday and a Jordanian man with a heart ailment was freed on Tuesday. The members of the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> royal family aboard are <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, a businessman, and his sisters, <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> and Anware. Release of the 17 jailed extremists has been a recurring demand of Shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to Iranian <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> that are believed to hold most of the 22 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many acts of terrorism in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have been blamed on Shiite Moslems acting for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has been at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since September 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his bitter fight for the Republican presidential nomination against <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> behind him, says he wants <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to help him win the general election in the fall. The two men met privately Wednesday in the Capitol for the first time since their angry face-off on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor last February. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters afterward that they had a `` good, friendly discussion.'' At an earlier session in the same building, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had lunch with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who is continuing a half-hearted campaign to be <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee. They discussed ways to keep the former television evangelist's supporters active in Republican politics. `` There's no question that we plan to support the Republican nominee, and it looks as though it's going to be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he wanted to be `` a rallying point for conservatives'' at the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> so he could encourage his supporters to remain involved in Republican politics. `` I want to make sure that it's the type of platform that will make them get in with both hands and both feet and go to work,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he would not campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before the April 19 primary. His Secret Service protection was withdrawn at his request Wednesday. In an interview published in today's editions of the paper, he said it would be `` more quixotic than it is realistic'' to continue actively campaigning. A <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattulo </PERSON>, said today he would make `` two or three'' speeches a week supporting conservative causes and candidates, and go to the Republican National Convention `` whether we add delegates before then or not.'' `` He has made a committment to supporters and a number of candidates in races around the counry at the local level,'' said <PERSON> Gattulo </PERSON>. `` No matter how many delegates he takes -LRB- to the convention -RRB-, he will have a voice there. He is also laying the foundation for years to come, as a conservative voice and for a future campaign.'' `` He has already talked about running in 1992,'' she said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had already laid off most of his campaign staff and has made only a few campaign appearances recently, because he is bumping up against federal campaign spending limits. After his talk with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that he wanted the Kansan to work on his behalf `` as much as he possibly has time to give. A lot of it's here and a lot of it I hope will be around the country.'' `` We're ready to go to work,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Asked whether the two men had buried the hatchet, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I do n't have a hatchet. I'm a nice fellow.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said their conversation focused on `` how to beat Democrats.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON> said later that the men talked about `` keeping the Republican nomination interesting until the convention'' in August and `` ways to get the issues out there.'' During a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote last Feb. 4, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> walked up to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and accused him of condoning a campaign attack that amounted to `` groveling in the mud.'' The face-off was sparked by a written statement made by a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aide implying that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> accepted favors from the wealthy. It also said three federal agencies were examining a defunct blind trust once held by his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dropped out of the race and endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month.

 Here are excerpts from the joint statement issued Thursday by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> after their meeting in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>. The excerpts were carried in English by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. As a result of the meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> arrived at a common view on the following: _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will act in accordance with the statements published on Feb. 8, 1988 These statements imparted a new impulse to the process of the political settlement of the most complex regional conflict and made it possible to place negotiations on the plane of a practical solution. _ The general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the president of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> believe that the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been removed, thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved in the settlement, and favor their immediate signing Both sides duly assess the role of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general and his personal representative, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. The Afghan president welcomes the readiness of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to act as guarantors of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reaffirm that in the event of the conclusion within the shortest period of the said agreements, the Afghanistan-USSR understanding that the Soviet troops will be withdrawn within the period fixed by these agreements, starting from May 15, 1988, will remain in force _ The policy of national reconciliation makes it possible to settle the situation around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, end the war and fratricide, establish peace throughout the country's territory and form a coalition government with the participation of all forces representing Afghan society, including those who are currently opposed to one another _ The final status of their country among other states will be determined by the Afghans themselves and nobody but them The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reaffirms its support for President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s statement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as an independent, non-aligned and neutral state. It proceeds from the premise that the territory of that country or any of its part will never be used for purposes hostile to its neighbors with regard to which <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will continue a policy of good-neighborly relations and cooperation. This equally applies to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the republic of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Soviet side backs the Afghan president's statement to the effect that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s internal structure will rest on a multi-party system in the political field and on a multi-sectoral basis in the economic sphere. _ It is of key importance for implementing the policy of national reconciliation to create satisfactory conditions for the return of Afghan refugees ... and grant them rights on an equal basis with all citizens of the country The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will extend assistance to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in creating such conditions. _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, relying on relations of traditional and historical friendship, expresses the readiness to cooperate with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at a high level ... to restore the economy and facilitate the economic and social development of ... <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ The general secretary and the president call on other states to contribute to establishing peace and national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and respect the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords This would set a good and encouraging example for resolving other regional conflicts.

 A man who believes some police officers have a `` fascist'' background was dismissed today as a juror in the cocaine trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, son of former Democratic vice-presidential nominee <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, is charged with selling a small amount of cocaine to an undercover police officer two years ago On Wednesday, District Court Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> had refused to dismiss <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON> from the jury, despite objections from the prosecutor about <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON>'s comments on police. Under questioning, <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON> had said, `` I have often felt that some people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background. They like to have power.'' <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> renewed the argument today, telling the judge that <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON> `` has preconceived notions about police officers.'' <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> then agreed to dismiss <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON>. The feelings about police are important in the case because the defense wants to show that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, then a student at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, was entrapped by an undercover police officer acting only on rumor. Lawyers had hoped to start opening arguments today, but the dismissal of <LOCATION> Mayka </LOCATION> and slow questioning of replacements may delay those arguments until Friday. Jury selection began Monday. Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the prominence of <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> could affect his view of the case. But most said they were aware of the case, prompting the two sides to repeatedly ask whether the jurors' deliberations would be affected by what they know. Although both the state and the defense have said they were fearful of the effect of the pre-trial publicity, many of the potential jurors said they discounted what they had read, because of a distrust of the press. `` They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because they have been charged,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, have attended the questioning, which is taking place in the cramped chambers of the presiding judge to put the potential jurors at ease. The process has shed some light on the strategies lawyers may take in the trial. <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> has asked potential jurors if they have any objections to police acting on rumors and to the use of undercover police officers. Police said they began their investigation of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> after hearing he was dealing drugs. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON> has asked jurors if they would be willing to acquit someone based on a technical defect in the state's case. The defense is expected to try to prove that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was entrapped by the police, and that the police singled him out because of his famous mother.

 A jump in the Dow Jones industrial average tested the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> voluntary limit on computerized program trading for the first time, but Wall Street experts differ on whether the restriction matters. Traders said a cheer erupted on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s vast floor when the widely-followed average careened past 50 points at about 3:20 p.m Wednesday, automatically placing the `` collar'' on so-called index arbitrage trading for the rest of the day. The Dow average closed at 2,061.67, up 64.16 points. The momentum of that rally helped inspire strong buying in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today that pushed prices past their pre-crash levels. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 195.82 points Wednesday, gained another 258.05 today, reaching 26,769.22. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up about 22 points to the 1767 level by late afternoon. But as of late morning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, however, the momentum stalled and the Dow Jones average was off about two points to the 2,059 level. Although the average had flirted with a 50-point daily up or down limit at least four times since the restriction was announced Feb. 4, Wednesday marked the first time the threshold was breached. The collar is part of an effort to suppress wild price swings in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash and restore investor confidence. Some traders said that without the limit, the Dow average might have risen as much as 100 points Wednesday, but others said it was impossible to know. `` There was a lot of program trading when the Dow was up between 35 and 49 points,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It went from 40 to 49 within five minutes.'' Several other influences boosted stocks, notably a stronger dollar and lessening fears of higher interest rates. But many brokers said program trading played at least a partial role in the Dow's sudden surge. Program trading refers to a sophisticated form of arbitrage, the simultaneous purchase and sale of similar goods in different markets in order to profit from price disparities. Using computers that instantly place massive orders, program traders buy stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and sell corresponding stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, or vice versa. Many brokers have blamed the technique for injecting enormous volatility _ as well as crushing trading volume _ into the stock market without regard for underlying stock values. Some studies have suggested program trading was an important element in the October crash. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON> said Wednesday after the 50-point collar was triggered that `` it's not the solution but it's clearly a first step in controlling what we call intra-day volatility. Asked how far the Dow average would have moved without the limit, <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON> said, `` If you talked to 10 people you'd get 10 different answers. I have no idea.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Twenty-First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which utilizies program trading, said he believed the technique was n't an element in the Dow's rise Wednesday, largely because the price disparities between stocks and stock-index futures were n't profitable enough for widespread arbitrage `` It's sort of a non-event,'' he said. `` Program trading was n't fueling the up move I do n't think there was any particular rhyme or reason to it.'' Others said the reaching of the limit caused the Dow to retreat several points before it began moving up again, but at a slower pace that reflected the absence of program trading's influence. `` Without the restriction, I think you would have seen it up 100 points today,'' <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON> said. `` I think the limit is good because it gives people a little pause to reflect rather than buying with abandon.''

 Police found the body of kidnapped Dutch retail tycoon <PERSON> Gerrit-Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> buried in a forest seven months after his abduction, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office said today. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> was kidnapped last Sept. 9 and shot through the head the same day. His body was exhumed in a forest near the town of <LOCATION> Renkum </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> on the instructions of his suspected killer, who was arrested Wednesday, according to spokesman <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bot </PERSON>. The discovery ended the longest-running kidnap case in Dutch criminal history. The tycoon's family had paid the kidnappers a $ 4 million ransom in a bid to win his release. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>, who was 56 when he died, was vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' largest chain of supermarkets as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and Bi-Lo stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, authorities arrested a 45-year-old unemployed architect, his wife, his three children aged 17 to 25 and a house guest at the suspect's home in the village of <LOCATION> Landsmeer </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. The guest was released later. According to <ORGANIZATION> Bot </ORGANIZATION>, the architect was found in possession of the murder weapon as well as a ransom worth more than $ 4.5 million paid for <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> in a Nov. 27 drop. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> was abducted on Sept. 9 while on his way to a dental appointment from his sprawling villa in <LOCATION> Bloemendaal </LOCATION>, an affluent suburb of this western Dutch city. After the estimated $ 4 million in diamonds and cash was paid in November, nothing was heard from the kidnapped businessman or his abductors. The kidnapping case was marked by lengthy and fruitless negotiations between the <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> family and the abductors via advertisements published in various national newspapers. Police imposed a news blackout only a few days after <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> was kidnapped at the request of the family. On Oct. 14, after <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s relatives had demanded a sign of life from the kidnap victim, the abductors mailed what appeared to be his little finger. At the time, it could not be established whether <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> had been alive or dead when the finger was cut from his hand. Stymied by the silence maintained by the abductors after the ransom drop, police staged a massive media blitz late December, when the authorities showed the scant evidence available in a nationally televised news conference. That event triggered a flow of about 12,000 tips, which have been checked by the 40-strong detective force permanently assigned to the case. The suspect's house was kept under surveillance by detective teams for six weeks, the reports said. Early Wednesday morning, heavily armed police raided the house, a small four-room, semi-detached building, surprising the suspects in their sleep, according to the newspapers. The main suspect was identified by the newspapers as <PERSON> Ferdi </PERSON> E. No immediate confirmation of his identity could be obtained from police. The five suspects were being kept in police custody here pending charges, the reports said.

 Jewish activists who consider <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> anti-Semitic, anti-Israel or both are mobilizing to turn voters against his Democratic presidential bid in the crucial <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. Even though his efforts to make peace with Jews appear to have diminished the degree of antipathy toward him since 1984, lingering suspicion has set the stage for what may become the most negative response to his 1988 campaign, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s assessment of the situation was summarized in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post </LOCATION> headline last weekend _ `` <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> to Jews: ` You've got to be crazy to vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>.''' `` I'm getting dozens of letters every week with expressions of concern about the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We will absolutely not support a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> candidacy ... because he is not a friend of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked how he expected to fare among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Jewish voters. `` You'll never get all of any one group,'' he said. `` All you can do is reach out. I've reached out and I'm glad to see people are responding.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign advisers have suggested tackling the problem directly. They propose either a private session with members of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of local Jewish organizations, or a public speech to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support for setting up a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state does not go over well with Jews, who are not pacified by his talk of the need to secure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders as well. A widely circulated photograph of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> embracing <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> further hurt <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reputation with Jews In addition, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> voters have not forgotten that during his 1984 presidential campaign, he used the offensive terms `` Hymie'' and `` Hymietown,'' and he associated with <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, who called <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> a `` dirty religion.'' The support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> enjoys among Arab-Americans is simply another reason Jews find to be suspicious. They are not swayed by the fact that he has a Jewish campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> `` is not part of my campaign'' and that he is not in communication with him. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> apologized for his use of the Hymie term. But these issues will no doubt come to the fore in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where the active and large Jewish population is a significant portion of the electorate. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has poured out anti-Jackson commentary, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s rivals <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are highlighting <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues in their campaigns. In addition, two Jewish committees have formed to distribute material and demonstrate against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mid-March </ORGANIZATION> showed that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made some headway among Jewish voters. Thirty-six percent had a favorable opinion of him, while 43 percent were unfavorable, compared to 17 percent favorable and 62 percent unfavorable in January. But that does n't mean they will vote for him when given alternative Democrats, several Jewish leaders said. `` A vast majority of Jews will not vote for him,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON>, a Jewish state assemblyman from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, said, `` If <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is on the ticket or even in a position where it is clear that he is going to be a major player after the election, my district will overwhelmingly vote Republican. I will speak in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. There's no doubt about it.'' He said his Coalition for a <LOCATION> Positive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will distribute leaflets at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> public events. A <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> group and Americans against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a Jewish-oriented group, are planning anti-Jackson demonstrations. Already, the groups are circulating flyers with a photograph of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and `` his best friend <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> strategists have said there are no plans to change the overall campaign strategy to deal with Jewish complaints. They point out he has spoken on pro-Jewish issues such as Soviet Jewry and the need for a secure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` There are some people who wo n't let go of the past,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> foreign policy adviser <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON>. He noted that since 1984 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has met with many Jewish groups and leaders in trying to mend fences. `` It does n't mean the suspicion is gone,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Saperstein </PERSON> of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` He now has to figure out how to take some of the things he has been saying and make them convincing to the Jewish community.''

<HEAD>Defense Restates Claims That FBI Approved Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A memo to former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> shows he knew as early as 1983 that <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was authorized to take part in `` illegal activities,'' Pressers' attorneys say. The memo to <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was among documents filed in federal court Wednesday by <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s lawyers in an effort to show that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> had government permission to allow so-called `` ghost employees'' on the payroll of Teamster Local 507 in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s lawyers claim the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> authorized him to keep the no-show employees, who reputedly had underworld ties, as a way of gathering information about the mob. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> has previously produced the statements of two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to support his claim of authorization. The government claims <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>; his lawyer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; and three <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents concocted the authorization defense in 1985 to protectPresser from indictment. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of Local 507, and two other union officials, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, are charged with racketeering in the alleged $ 700,000 payroll padding scheme. Their trial is set for July 12. In the memo to <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> recommended `` that authorization for <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> to participate in illegal activities be elevated from the field to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> HQ -LRB- headquarters -RRB-.'' Memos filed Wednesday were intended to rebut a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claim that the government did not know about the authorization until 1985, when <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> told department officials about it. `` How can the government now claim that it first learned about authorization on June 11, 1985, and how can it now claim that it was concocted at or around that time when the director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> knew about it at least two years prior?'' <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> said in court papers with the Revell memo. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s lawyers say they are having problems obtaining documents from the government to prepare their defense and have asked for a hearing on their motion to dismiss the case. Wednesday's brief was a response to a brief filed in March by prosecutors opposing <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s attempts to have the case dismissed.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said today they had solved all problems blocking a settlement in the Afghan war. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said it intended to begin removing its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> next month. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator in the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks indicated that major differences remain. But <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s president said an agreement was ready to be signed. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said in a joint statement issued after meeting in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> that the troop withdrawal would start May 15 if the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations are successful `` in the shortest period.'' The statement did n't mention of the issue of foreign aid to the warring parties, which is seen as the main obstacle in reaching an accord. After the statement was released, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, `` There are very difficult decisions and the only good thing _ I think that is important _ is that the political will is obviously there to take them.'' He would not elaborate. The negotiating parties _ <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Soviet-backed government and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, representing Afghan guerrillas _ tentatively agreed in February that the Soviets would start removing their 115,000 troops on May 15 if an accord were signed by March 15. With the passage of that deadline, the sides have tentatively agreed that the Soviet withdrawal would begin two months after the signing of an accord. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks have been stalled since March 2 because of the aid issue. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the guerrillas' leading weapons supplier, has called for a simultaneous cutoff in military aid. Soviet officials contend they have every right to aid their ally, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and say the issue has no place in the peace talks. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> was quoted today as saying that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had solved that problem, `` so the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord could now be signed any time.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Pakistani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> as telling Parliament: `` According to unofficial reports, the two superpowers have agreed on the symmetry under which both would be able to provide continued assistance to their respective allies in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' It did not elaborate on the `` unofficial'' reports. The Gorbachev-Najib statement, carried by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, did not clarify how much time the two sides would allow for conclusion of a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord before their offer of a May 15 pullout expires. `` The last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved in the settlement and favor their immediate signing,'' the declaration said. It said the road was now clear for formation of a coalition government including all political forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` including those who are currently opposed to one another.'' Many of the rebels fighting the Afghan government have refused to join in <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s previous political overtures, which he calls `` national reconciliation.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has demanded that a broad-based coalition government, including guerrilla and refugee leaders, be in place before the Soviets leave. Otherwise, it says, bloody civil strife could continue and an estimated 5 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not want to return. The Afghan guerrillas have been fighting the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government since an April 1978 revolution brought communists to power. Soviet soldiers intervened Dec. 27, 1979. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, capital of the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. The Soviet leader's trip occurred under unusually tight security. Even Soviet photographers were not permitted to cover his departure or arrival. <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> borders <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> is 450 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, and 1,700 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> today. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had said the two were meeting with the following in mind: `` If no agreement is reached at the Afghan-Pakistani talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will act in keeping with their national interests. The political decision on the Soviet troops' withdrawal remains unchanged.''

<HEAD>American Negotiators Reportedly Boycott Base Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators today boycotted talks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases after newspapers reported a dispute over American rights to launch combat missions without <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s approval, sources said The two sides issued a joint statement saying <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> and Filipino Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> had agreed to skip the morning session. But Filipino sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Philippine panel waited more than two hours for the Americans to show up for the morning meeting before learning they were not coming. Both sides attended an afternoon session. Talks began Tuesday on the status of a 1947 agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains six military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The sources said the Americans were angry about news leaks concerning sharp differences over terms for use of the installations, including <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the Subic Bay naval base. Most major <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers reported that during Wednesday's talks, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> asked for changes in the agreement to require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to obtain `` prior consent'' for combat operations launched from the bases The current agreement simply requires `` prior consultations.'' According to the reports, <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said the demand would `` cripple'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to maneuver and maintain its worldwide security network. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> reportedly said the demand indicated the Filipinos did not trust the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials refused comment on the news reports. But Filipino sources close to the talks said the reports were accurate. Before the talks began, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> had said Filipino negotiators would seek changes in the agreement to strengthen Philippine sovereignty and serve the national interest. He has also called for increases in the $ 180 million annual fee that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pays for use of the installations. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has said $ 1.2 billion a year would be `` reasonable.'' The talks, expected to last three months, coincide with a growing public demand to close the bases. Many Filipinos see them as a vestige of American colonial rule. Under the new constitution, any extension of the base agreement beyond 1991 requires approval of two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where anti-base sentiment is strong. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said Tuesday the bases are essential because of the `` significant Soviet presence'' in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.

 Genetic tests at a British university failed to shed any new light on whether <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> committed a rape that his accuser later said never happened, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said today. Dr. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON>, the scientist who conducted the tests, said the evidence `` was too degraded for analysis'' with the sophisticated genetic test, the governor said in a written statement. <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON> suggested that an alternative test might be able to analyze the evidence, and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he would consider that recommendation. The test focused on an article of clothing worn by <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> at the time <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> allegedly attacked her. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was freed from prison in 1985 after serving six years when <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> recanted the testimony she gave at his trial.

 Retired judge Judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> today denied a published report that said Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> spoke to him about retiring and said he wanted <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to be his successor as the nation's chief law officer. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who declined an offer Monday to become chief deputy attorney general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said his remarks in an interview in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> leaving office were misinterpreted. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> took issue with a story in today's editions of The Morning Call. According to the article, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told him it was the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan to have <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> named to succeed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would have to step down. `` That is not correct,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I can tell you unequivocally there was never such a discussion ... it's a very serious mistake.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said instead he discussed stepping in for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> when the attorney general was out of the country. Morning Call City Editor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said the newspaper story was correct. `` The version as we reported is what we'll stand by,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney, here visiting <ORGANIZATION> Muhlenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to lecture on the Constitution, discussed his interview with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> during a meeting with college officials and guests at a reception Wednesday, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was considered for appointment as <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s chief deputy last week, declined the appointment because of reluctance to interrupt his law practice and leave his family for an indefinite period. Two ranking <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> aides resigned out of concern that an 11-month-old criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations and image. A third top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official left to take a judgeship. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, for the number-two job at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. According to the Morning Call, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the attorney general mentioned the possibility that he would leave the post several times. He said he wanted to make sure he fully understood <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s plan `` ` Well, if you have to leave, you would want me to become the attorney general. Is that correct?''' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he inquired. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, he said, replied affirmatively, according to the original story. When asked whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would concur, he said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> replied: `` I have talked to the president, and that is his wish, also.'' `` I told Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that I would do anything that I could to help,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I would be available for counsel and I did give him my advice. But I declined the job offer, and I have no second thoughts.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he does not think much will be accomplished at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> while <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is still there. `` I do n't think that he is going to leave, and I do n't think that the president is going to remove him. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is very loyal to his friends,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. When asked whether he thought <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would be indicted for his conduct, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> responded: `` It is very unlikely that he will be indicted. I do n't think that there is sufficient evidence against him to support an indictment.'' Although he is not privy to details of the investigation, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> emphasized that an 11-month review by special prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has not produced anything against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that would warrant prosecution of the attorney general. The 66-year-old <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who recently retired from the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, could not be reached for comment by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> early today because a woman who answered the phone at his house refused to wake him.

 Workers are using a new method involving clay mixed with solvents to clean the stained marble of the Taj Mahal, the world's greatest monument to love. The `` clay pack technique'' is used to remove stains and yellowing caused by pollution and fumes from an oil refinery 28 miles northwest of the landmark. The 17th century all-marble monument at <LOCATION> Agra </LOCATION>, 111 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, was built by the Moghal emperor <PERSON> Shahjahan </PERSON> in memory of his wife, <PERSON> Mumtaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahal </PERSON>. <PERSON> L.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahi </PERSON>, minister of state for culture and education, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that the clay packs had been used on a few areas of the Taj on an experimental basis. He said the treatment had proved to be satisfactory and would be extended to clean large surfaces. In the method, inert clay and non-toxic detergents are spread on the marble. The yellowing film on the marble is absorbed by the clay after being washed away by the detergents, <PERSON> Sahi </PERSON> said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> put his faltering Democratic presidential bid on hold today and said `` I have no illusions that the nomination will come my way,'' but he kept a lock on his delegates in hopes he can wield influence at the July nominating convention. `` In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows what twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would make a final decision on his candidacy after the last primaries on June 7. In the meantime, he said he will devote his time to his duties as an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator. He said by holding onto his delegates until the convention, he hoped to have some influence over who the party nominates. `` I want to make sure this country does what it ought to do,'' he told reporters. He attributed his campaign's stall to his own failure to effectively communicate his message of traditional Democratic philosophy and advocacy of a legitimate role for government in bringing about social reforms. The campaign also was hampered by a lack of money, he said, but added he will finish with only about $ 400,000 in debts. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s quasi-withdrawal leaves just three Democrats in the race. His decision comes after months of poor showings; he won only his home-state primary. During his travels around the nation, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he found `` there really is a yearning across this good land for leadership that appeals to the noble in us, rather than the greed in us.'' `` Government is not the enemy,'' he said. `` Government is simply a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely. ... We can do better, my friends.'' He said problems like the arms race, unemployment, crime and inadequacies in health care and education `` are not the result of acts of God, but the result of insensitive leadership, chosen by a people who sometimes are not as caring nor as careful as they might be.'' In the statement, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> minimized chances that he might seek the presidency again in 1992. `` Running for president is a little like taking an ice-cold shower,'' he said. `` It is a great one-time experience, but I have no yearning for a repeat performance.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, according to an aide, hoped to pick up additional delegates as an inactive candidate between now and the convention. His decision `` reflects the reality of having lost a great many primaries and caucuses,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. `` It will give those who supported <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> -LRB- a chance -RRB- to have full representation at the convention.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, said Wednesday her son would remain an official candidate, although suspending his campaign, because `` too many people have advised him to stay in.'' `` He's going to hang in there till the end,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the senator and his family would take a week's vacation <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who entered the race a year ago promising a return to `` leadership rooted in the traditional values of our party,'' was unable to put together a winning campaign formula. He had a brief rendezvous with momentum prior to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s first-in-the-nation February caucuses, emerging on top in several polls of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> voters taken late in 1987, but things began to cool off after <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> re-entered the race in mid-December When Feb. 8 arrived, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> finished a close second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> behind <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. A week later, he came in third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> behind <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. It was mostly downhill from there. He placed third or worse in most primaries and caucuses and sat out the Super Tuesday contests in 20 states. He has garnered 170.5 delegates, compared with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 740.55, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 704.55 and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s 394.8. He did win last month's primary in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but was unable to build on that victory and claim the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> country, making poor showings in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the region. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 59, is known for his trademark bow tie and liberal views. But on the campaign trail he portrayed himself as a `` make-no-apologies <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee ... waging a fight for the heart and the soul of the Democratic party.'' `` I want a government that cares. I want a government that is responsive to the needs of the less fortunate,'' he told voters. He painted himself the modern equivalent of plain-talking <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, saying people are `` ready for something other than the slick, packaged product. We're ready for somebody who's going to level with us.'' He proposed long-term health care for the elderly, a public works program for the unemployed and new education initiatives, and promised that as president he would balance the budget in three years. That brought criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals who claimed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was short on details when it came to explaining how he would simultaneously finance expensive new programs and balance the budget. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in one debate said `` Simonomics is really Reaganomics with a bow tie.'' He called <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> a `` promise-as-you-go Democrat.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a first-term senator and four-time congressman, countered such criticisms by claiming that too many Democrats `` have bought into the Republican mindset, which claims we ca n't afford to invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future.''

 A Danish group plans to set up <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first alligator farm in southern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to produce skins and meat for export, the project organizer said Thursday. `` The baby alligators would come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and be bred at the farm in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but it would take three to four years before production and export of the reptiles' skin and meat could begin,'' said <PERSON> Leif </PERSON> <PERSON> Skovgaard </PERSON> in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skovgaard </PERSON>, a chartered accountant who is organizing the project for a group of seven Danish investors, said 10,000-12 ,000 alligators would be bred yearly at a farm near the town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roque </LOCATION> European Alligator Institue, as the project is called, seeks financial support from the local and state governments in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>.

Two other men decided to continue their trek through the 18-mile-long cave known as Cueto-Coventosa, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s second-largest and a favorite of national and international spelunkers, he said. `` Everything went fine until we ran into the swollen waters of a lake on our way towards the Coventosa exit,'' one of the men rescued told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> shortly after emerging from the cave. <PERSON> Isla </PERSON> said doctors declared the seven men who emerged from the cave in good condition, but advised them to eat and get some sleep. He said the men had been near to using up their food supplies. More than 100 cave explorers took part in the search that began Monday when explorers, who were aged between 18 and 30, failed to emerge as planned after entering the cave Friday. The cave is on the outskirts of <PERSON> Arredondo </PERSON>, 23 miles east of the northern port of <LOCATION> Santander </LOCATION>.

 Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, author of the amendments which barred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, announced today that he will retire after 36 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've decided to call it a day,'' the 76-year-old <PERSON> Democrfat </PERSON> said at a news conference at <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION>, surrounded by supporters in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> neighborhood where he was born and raised. `` The parades are all over. The give and take of the campaign trail no longer beckons and the time has come when the bell tolls on a career that has been for me an exhilarating and fulfilling experience,'' he said. Speculation that he might retire led three Democrats _ <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, former Mayor <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimauro </PERSON> and state Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemanski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> _ to announce they were interested in the seat, provided they did n't have to oppose the incumbent in a primary. <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> did not endorse anyone to succeed him. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's frustration with the Boland Amendments inspired the diverion of profits from arms sales to support the Contras. That operation became a focus of the Iran-Contra investigation and the recent indictment of former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and others. The reserved <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the man who would later become the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, in 1952. For more than 20 years, the two friends roomed together in an arrangement they described as a real-life `` Odd Couple'' with <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, the neat and tidy half of the pair. Many expected him to follow <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> into retirement in 1986, but some believed that <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> stayed, in part, in the hopes of taking over the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> is the No. 2 Democrat on the powerful panel and would be in line for the chairmanship if <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> retired. <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, who is a year older than <LOCATION> Boland </LOCATION>, has already announced plans to run for re-election. The son of <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> immigrants who settled in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hungry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> at age 22 and never lost an election in a half-century in politics. <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> served as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1977 to 1985.

 Leaders of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s fractious Moslem guerrillas are forming their own regime to challenge the communist government from `` liberated'' areas when Soviet military forces are gone. The alliance of seven parties, three moderate and four fundamentalist, has been meeting almost daily to preserve unity while they lay the groundwork for their own government. `` There is hope that it will work,'' a moderate leader said. `` No doubt, when the Russians leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime will collapse,'' said <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the alliance. `` To avoid anarchy and possible armed clashes to seize power, it's necessary that all parties agree to a temporary government. Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 soldiers now are helping fight the insurgency, which began after a Communist coup in April 1978. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> issued a joint statement Thursday saying all obstacles had been cleared in negotiations to end the war and the Soviets hope to start pulling their troops out next month. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator indicated major differences remain but <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where 3.5 million Afghan refugees have taken refuge, said an agreement was ready for signing. The guerrilla alliance has agreed to hold elections among fighters in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for a council that would vote on establishing of an interim Moslem government. Leaders of the seven groups have named <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> as president and <PERSON> Zabihullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> as his deputy to lead a 21-member Cabinet, in which each party is to have at least two members. A leadership council of the seven guerrilla leaders would function as the head of state and supervise <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s government, which would operate from a `` defended'' area beyond the reach of the Communist government's forces <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON>, leader of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Harkat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, named five guerrilla-controlled areas: <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Noorestan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakitia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> and Hazarejat. <PERSON> Sebghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>, leader of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` If we come under pressure in one place, we will move to another.'' Agreement also has been reached on having a judiciary committee to settle disputes among the parties. `` We will work hard for the liberation of Afghanistank, but the devil ... may influence some people and encourage disputes,'' <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> said. `` We hope our brothers will understand that, except for unity, solidarity and compromise, there is no other way to reach our pure goals. For the freedom of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and in order to create true Islam in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, we must put aside all these disputes. There is hope that it will work.'' Not all rebel leaders are equally keen on forming an interim government inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> fears it could cut the nation in half. `` If there are two governments in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, there is the danger of partition into north and south or east and west, as with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, or East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> prefers a transitional government in exile until the Communist regime can be overthrown. <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON> of the hardline <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> faction expects outside interference. `` Colonialist countries, the superpowers _ East or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> _ have joined hands to prevent the creation of a total Islamic government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where Shiite Moslems dominate, is urging <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas to reject a Sunni Moslem government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where Sunnis are in the majority. `` Therefore, we can not for certain bring about an Islamic government in the present circumstances,'' he said. `` This is why we declare we will not abandon our jihad -LRB- holy war -RRB-.'' Deep-seated frictions persist. One source <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, who is unpopular even in the hardline camp but recently replaced <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> as head of the alliance. `` He is not the leader but only head of the alliance. Every party is independent,'' <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> said. `` Of course we have had our complaints. The brothers have warned him that, now that he has become the head, it does not mean he has all the authority in his hand to do whatever he likes.'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s men have been accused of harassing guerrillas of other parties, journalists and relief workers traveling to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. His party, also called Hezb-i-Islami, has been blamed for the killing of a British cameraman last year. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> has denied it.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> today put his presidential campaign on hold, reducing the Democratic quartet to a trio. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, meanwhile, zeroed in on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> issues, seen as a likely sore spot for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the upcoming <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has lost everywhere except in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, suspended campaign activities, but stopped short of dropping out. He said he would make a final decision on his candidacy after the final primary on June 7. `` In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows what twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference. But he added: `` I have no illusions that the nomination will come my way.'' The three remaining active Democrats were all campaigning today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which holds its primary April 19. At stake are 255 delegates, in what will be the biggest state contest to date. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, in an interview published today, said he is unlikely to make an endorsement before the primary. And he warned the Democrats _ singling out <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ that negative campaigning is `` terribly dangerous.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, today endorsed <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s appeal to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to tone down his criticism of rivals <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The admonitions that have been addressed to Senator <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> by Governor <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in a positive way,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` All those admonitions are helpful and are on course, as far as I'm concerned.'' On the Republican side, there was plenty of parley: Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the nominee in all but name, met Wednesday with former rival Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who pledged to work to get <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> elected. And <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who remains in the Republican race although he concedes he has little chance of being nominated. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said that by suspending his campaign, he will hold onto his delegates until the convention and perhaps have some say over the party's nominee. `` I want to make sure this country does what it ought to do,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> made his last stand in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where he finished a weak fourth in Tuesday's primary. The Illinois senator ran second in the leadoff <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses on Feb. 8, in what was to be his best showing of the campaign outside of his home state. After finishing third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> a week later, he did not have enough money to campaign actively for the round of contests on Super Tuesday, March 8, and was consequently clobbered. Many expected him to drop out after that, but <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, under pressure from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> supporters, stayed in for his home-state primary, then said his victory there was enough reason to remain in the race. For the other Democrats, the battle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> began in earnest on Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at work courting voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s large Jewish community, stressing the need for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace plan that would allow <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` live in peace and harmony. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> reiterated his strong support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as he campaigned Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said as president, he would create a Cabinet-level position to focus full-time on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for a lack of experience in international affairs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> decried such infighting, saying his admonition was directed mainly at <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous and counterproductive in a primary where one of you will be the nominee,'' he said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, seen by some Democrats as a potential draftee in the event of a deadlocked convention, said he preferred to wait until after the primary season to make an endorsement. `` That's the time for leadership in this process,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, after spending a day in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, which holds <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucuses on April 16, and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where primary day is May 3. In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked how he expected to do among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Jewish voters. `` You'll never get all of any one group,'' he said. `` All you can do is reach out. I've reached out and I'm glad to see people are responding.'' Many Jews were offended by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' _ for which he apologized _ and his association with <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, who called <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> a `` gutter religion.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> no longer has ties to <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, his campaign says. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made numerous efforts to mend fences with the Jewish community. After three straight wins _ in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leading in the national delegate race. The latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count put him at 740.55, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 704.55, uncommitted at 513.6, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 394.8 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 170.5 Even if he is not actively campaigning, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> could continue to gain delegates, and keep those he has. That would leave him in control of a delegate bloc that could give him some clout at the Democratic National Convention. Whether he meant it to or not, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to technically remain a candidate helps <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remain the leader in the delegate race. Under party rules, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is entitled to 47 at-large delegates from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to 13 and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> none. A Simon withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s column, and thus put him ahead in national delegate count. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> widened his margin of victory over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in Monday's <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses. Returns on Tuesday showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had narrowly won. On Wednesday, with 85 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had widened his lead to 11 percentage points, 45 to 34 percent.

 Although police do n't consider her a `` cold-blooded killer,'' a woman charged with concealing the shotgun slaying of her husband last November also is suspected of shooting him. <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 28, was arrested Monday at a relative's home in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where she has lived since moving in mid-December from the Quincy-area home she shared with her husband and two children, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, chief deputy for the <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> was charged with concealing the death of her husband, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 27, whose cremated remains were discovered March 15 in woods near the <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s home, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Global registration began Thursday for a second Sport Aid `` Race Against Time,'' the six-mile street jog by nearly 20 million people in 1986 that raised $ 35 million for starving Africans. Organizers are hoping to involve all 218 countries and inhabited territories in the Sept. 11 extravaganza, compared with 89 nations last time. Major charities and sports federations in 85 countries have already joined the Sport Aid'88 campaign. `` We're trying to build on that new constituency of compassion,'' said an organizer, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dring </PERSON>. `` All we can do is to create a forum for this to happen and say to the world, ` Please join us.''' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to contribute more this year, Dring said. Sport Aid was a flop in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1986 because it coincided with a nationwide `` Hands Across America'' campaign to raise funds for the poor and homeless. `` America is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Dring said in an interview. `` It lives within itself so adequately, it's very difficult sometimes to involve them in events of this nature. `` We're presently in discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and with a number of major sponsors in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and we believe this year <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will run,'' he said. The first person to register for this year's run was <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>, a Sudanese athlete who dramatized the plight of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s famine victims when he carried a burning charcoal ember in an Olympic torch to 14 countries to launch the May 25, 1986, event Each runner will be given an individual number tag, starting with <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>'s No. 1, which he donned during a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It will give every single individual a common sense of identity,'' said another organizer, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. The race will start on Sept. 11 when a boy and a girl from each participating country or territory runs through the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to give the signal for the worldwide series of raod races to begin. Money raised from sponsors of runners and from ticket sales to the races will go to needy children in mainly undeveloped countries. One-fifth of the money raised in developed countries will be put aside for disadvantaged and disabled children in those countries. The rest will be split between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' Children's Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The events will be televised live to an audience of more than 750 million people. In 1986, young and old crowded the streets and sidewalks of 279 cities from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ouagadougou </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> for the global race.

 It's against the law to sell beer or any other kind of alcoholic drink in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but a beer truck was welcomed Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> delivered 44,000 pounds of feed grain pellets made from malt leftovers, a brewing byproduct, for cattle left without grass because of last month's huge range fire. `` I'm sure it -LRB- the truck -RRB- will turn some heads in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but there's no beer in there,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, legislative affairs manager for Coors in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. County Extension Agent <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> and County Judge <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said they did n't know how many head of cattle remained. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said the majority have been moved out to other pastures. The high protein feed supplement should feed the remaining cattle for four days, <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said. Officials say the delivery was one of the largest donations to ranchers since the fire that began March 10 burned more than 300,000 acres in five counties. The grain pellets were donated by a <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> division, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biotech </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Dusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> of state Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s office.

 A civilian accused of taking a self-propelled howitzer for a joy ride with an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> private has pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge in exchange for dismissal of a felony charge. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 26, and Pvt. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON>, 19, took the tracked, armored <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> artillery piece from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> on Nov. 11 and drove it up Interstate 25 to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, trailed by a parade of police cars. When the howitzer ran out of gasoline, police arrested the men. <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> was sentenced earlier to 15 months in prison on military charges. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> faces a maximum of one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine as a result of his plea Wednesday to a charge of stealing personal property valued at $ 200 or less. He also may be required to pay restitution of $ 1,000 for minor damage to the howitzer and to fences that were broken at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>. The charge dropped was stealing the artillery piece. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said the 10-year sentence under that charge was too stiff for what amounted to a joyride. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON> accepted the plea bargain after making sure <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> had chosen a different mode of transportation to court. `` Yes, we came here together in my car,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Erler </PERSON> said. `` It gets better gas mileage than the vehicle he chose for his previous trip.'' <PERSON> Clair </PERSON>, an ammunition handler, said he got the idea of taking the howitzer as a means of getting out of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Torrez </PERSON> told him he was declared schizophrenic and given an honorable discharge and benefits after stealing a jeep in 1979. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> is on a military disability pension after having been discharged from the Army for psychiatric problems.

 Former Gov. A.B. `` Happy'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> today released a statement apologizing for a racial remark he made at a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> meeting. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, who appointed him to a voting position on the <LOCATION> UK </LOCATION> board earlier this year, called him today and `` took me to the woodshed'' for the remark. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> suggested that he apologize but did not request that he resign from the board, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. `` If he did, I'd resign,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> used the racial epithet Tuesday during a committee's discussion of the university's 1985 decision to dispose of its investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` You know <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s all nigger now. There are n't any whites,'' he said. About seven of the 20 board members were present. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said today at a news conference at his home here he stands on his record of helping blacks and other minorities throughout his lifetime of public service as governor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator and commissioner of baseball. `` I did n't intend to be offensive to anybody,'' said <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. In an interview Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Leader </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said students who protested the racial slur were `` trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.'' `` I do n't think I should be censured for this,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` I do n't think I deserve any harsh treatment.'' The Student Government Association on Wednesday night approved a resolution calling for <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>'s resignation from the board. Earlier, about 40 students marched on the university's administration building to meet with President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON> Some carried placards with slogans like `` Hopefully Happy is Sad.'' <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorham </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, said the group demanded an apology from <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, and if that was n't accomplished, his resignation. `` Let's see how far they -LRB- students -RRB- can go,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home. `` My whole record, I think, is good enough to overcome this.'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, 89, was commissioner of baseball from 1945-51 and takes credit for opening the door for <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to become the first black to play major-league baseball when <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> in 1946. During a second term as governor, he won praise for his endorsement of racial integration of schools. <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON> told the students that the `` university completely and totally repudiates'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>'s statement. `` It's completely contrary ... to what we want to have be the belief of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The university's only black trustee, <PERSON> Edythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, said she would ask the board to issue a statement `` to be sure the public knows this is not representative of the feelings of the board.''

 Two doctors say U.S.-made tear gas used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to curb <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protests may be causing deaths and injuries to civilians, but further studies are needed to determine the extent of the problem. `` Adequate research just has not been done,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Hu and Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> are associated with <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, a Boston-based group which is concerned that the Israelis may be misusing tear gas, a chemical agent that overcomes its victims by causing severe irritation to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. If tear gas is handled properly, the effects are not long-lasting, but it can kill people if it is fired in high doses into enclosed areas. `` It would not surprise me if there were deaths of infants or the infirm'' from too much exposure to tear gas in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> said. `` We believe it is important to do planned studies on this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group, claims that more than 30 people have died in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from exposure to tear gas, which also has caused injuries and miscarriages. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy, said those figures are wildly inflated. The Israelis have found only one probable death attributable to tear gas, he said. But the committee has asked <ORGANIZATION> TransTechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a tear gas manufacturer in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to halt shipments to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until it determines the substance is being properly handled. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has bought 120,000 tear gas grenades or projectiles from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's military sales credit program since the Arab disturbances began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> four months ago. <PERSON> Burl </PERSON> <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> TransTechnology </ORGANIZATION>, said the company is `` redoubling'' its effort to ensure the material is being used correctly after the committee `` presented what looked like evidence that it is being misused.'' Two types of tear gas _ code-named CN and <ORGANIZATION> CS </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ are made at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Saltsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` We are writing to the prime minister -LRB- of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- to try to get some attention to the proper use of the product,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> said. The company also has offered to send staff to train the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military on how to use the substance, but the Israeli government has not responded, she said. There have been reports from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that tear gas was fired into <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in January, and a canister landed in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in March. It has also been dropped by helicopter into refugee camps, witnesses say. But <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> said it is not the government's policy to fire tear gas into closed spaces, although some might drift into confined areas. `` It's mostly used outdoors,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> said tear gas is a safe, effective way to control crowds if directions are followed, and <ORGANIZATION> TransTechnology </ORGANIZATION> has no plans to stop selling to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Even if it is misused, you would see much more grief and many more fatalities and injuries if it were n't available,'' she said. Each batch of tear gas sold to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must be licensed under the Arms Export Control Act, which requires recipients to live up to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights standards. In 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to sell tear gas to <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> police because of that country's poor human rights performance. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be named, defended the Israelis' use of tear gas, and said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has not investigated any reports of misuse. `` We think maintaining order should be in the most humane way possible,'' the official said. `` One of those ways is tear gas.'' Fine of the human rights group said the long-term effects of tear gas have been `` understudied and underreported.'' He added: `` I would n't belittle the problem.'' Since disturbances began in the occupied territories four months ago, at least 138 Arabs, one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and one Israeli civilian have been killed.

<HEAD>Women Investigated in Lesbianism Probe at Marine Base</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chants of women recruits jogging in the warm April sun drift through the open windows of the Law Center at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>. Inside, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officers are continuing an investigation of lesbianism, which has already led to charges against several former drill instructors and at least one officer. Five women <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> have been charged with various counts including committing indecent acts. Two other women who were due to go before administrative hearing boards are seeking discharges. Each year, 20,000 recruits graduate from the 11-week basic training program at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. One of the four recruit battalions is made up of women and <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is the only base that provides basic training for the 10,060 women in the Corps. At least 10 women are under investigation and the probe by the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is likely to expand, according to a Marine who said she's a target and who has leaked word of the investigation in letters to a number of news organizations. `` Every base I've been on has had one of these so-called witch hunts,'' said the woman. `` One of the reasons I went to the press is to show there's an injustice being done,'' said the woman, who spoke on the condition her name not be used. `` If they're going to conduct these investigations they need to do it on the male side of the house as well.'' The woman denies she is homosexual and has not been formally charged. During the last three federal fiscal years, 90 women and 219 men have been dismissed for homosexuality, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. More than 40 percent of those discharged were women, who represent only about 5 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' strength. Department of Defense figures also show that, during the three-year period, 662 cases of homosexuality among Marines were investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and about a third of the investigations involved women. There's no clear reason for the disparity and the matter has never been studied, said <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She denied that special attention was being paid to lesbians. `` A commanding officer has the responsibility if someone in their command has indicated a reason to believe there's a violation of the <ORGANIZATION> UCMJ </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Uniform Code of Military Justice -RRB- to check it out,'' she said. The investigation at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> `` is not a regular occurrence but it's not an unprecedented thing,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, a spokesman for the base. Records of such cases are kept only about two years, but <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said he understood that there was a similar hearing involving women Marines three or four years ago. He said the base does n't make unsolicited announcements of such hearings but will answer media inquiries. The current proceedings are Article 32 hearings, which are similar to civilian grand jury hearings. They are, in effect, an open investigation in which defendants have certain rights and defense and prosecution witnesses can be called. The investigating officer then makes a non-binding recommendation to the Marine's commanding officer. The recommendation may be that the charges go to a court-martial, that the Marine go before an administrative discharge board or the charges be dismissed. In an administrative discharge board, a board of <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> determines whether the defendant has the potential for further service. A court-martial could lead to a prison sentence. In addition to the counts of indecent acts, the defendants face various charges including dereliction of duty, sodomy, conspiracy to obstruct justice and assault. `` Not all the charges are related to homosexuality,'' <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. `` In a larger sense, we are talking about breaches of good order and discipline.'' He said the Corps can not tolerate homosexuality because `` homosexuality is contrary to good order and discipline, not because there is a statement being made about lifestyles. `` Recruit training must be conducted with the highest standards of order and discipline,'' he added. `` The overwhelming majority of those who serve perform faultlessly.''

The bureau's administrative division issued a temporary work stoppage order a week after workers began rebuilding the $ 17 million facility. `` We're waiting for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reprogram the money to go ahead with reconstruction,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, a bureau spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` We've got the money, but it has not been appropriated to use for this purpose.''

<HEAD>Nine-Month-Old Recipient Of Multi-Organ Transplant To Leave
Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two months after being given a new liver, small bowel, pancreas and a portion of stomach, 9-month-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> is ready to go home, his doctor says. The success of the transplant operation so far is `` absolutely fantastic news'' that provides hope for other children suffering from multiorgan failure, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says. The boy, who is from <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, underwent a multiorgan transplant operation at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in February <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, the youngest child to receive such a transplant, is scheduled to be released from the hospital Saturday, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Wednesday. Only three other children are known to have had such transplants. Two have died; the third still is hospitalized. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was born with a twisted intestine that turned gangrenous and had to be removed a week later. That left him with an intestine too small to absorb food. Intravenous feeding kept him alive but destroyed his liver, necessitating the transplants. After the transplant surgery, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> battled setbacks, including holes in the donor small bowel, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` There have been a couple of times in this course that I did n't think he was going to survive,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said He said it was possible the boy will be able to function normally. `` I'm very encouraged by the progress that has been made so far, but it's still an experiment and we're still in the middle of it,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the donor bowel has been maturing well and the child now gets about two-thirds of his nutrition through it. He gets the rest of his nourishment through intravenous feeding. The doctor said he expects the boy will be weaned entirely from intravenous feeding within two weeks. The donor small intestine has not yet been connected to the boy's stomach, so he will have to return to the hospital in about two months to undergo an operation to connect it, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't say that we have the total solution to short gut syndrome in children, but we are strongly encouraged that this procedure can be a promising option for other children suffering from similar problems,'' he said.

 Officials of the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> cast secret ballots Friday for a new leader to carry on the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> order's 900-year-old tradition of chivalry, charity and nobility. Thirty-six electors will lock themselves in a villa on the <LOCATION> Aventine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Friday to vote for a successor to Fra Angelo de Mojana di Cologna. The order's grand master died Jan. 18 at the age of 82 after 25 years as the knights' supreme leader. The 78th grand master will be chosen from among 22 of the electors, including de Mojana's interim replacement, <PERSON> Fra </PERSON> <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallavicini </PERSON>, a Hungarian-born American biochemist. A grand master carries the title of prince and is addressed as `` Your Most Eminent Highness.'' Equal in rank to a cardinal, he is elected for life and is considered the highest-ranking layman in the Roman Catholic church. To be eligible for the position, he must have attained the top rank of `` Knight of Justice'' and followed vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. He also must be able to prove 200 years of nobility on the side of both parents. The result of the election will be announced only after the decision is ratified by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, possibly several days after the vote. The Sovereign Military Order of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> and of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> _ the group's full title _ was founded during the crusades when it opened a hospice for pilgrims in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the early 11th century. It has the status of an independent state and has diplomatic relations with 50 nations. The order is not related to the Knights of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, an American Roman Catholic society for men founded in 1882 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, that also is involved in charity and social works. The Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> dedicate themselves to chivalry, charity and nobility. Today the order has about 10,000 members, led by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> with 2,800 and followed closely by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 2,500, said spokesman <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jannone </PERSON> said. Among its well-known members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>, attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. Italian members include Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON>. Beyond the image of chivalry, pomp and noblesse oblige _ symbolized by their uniforms, cloaks, medals, plumed hats and swords _ the knights are known for their dedication to the sick and wounded. The order operates about 200 hospitals and first aid centers in 90 countries, especially in Third World nations and war zones. `` After centuries of fighting to protect our citizens and territory, the order has returned to its original function: health assistance, hospitals, fighting against hunger and misery,'' <PERSON> Jannone </PERSON> said in an interview. For centuries, membership in the order required proof of `` blue blood,'' but some ranks including `` Knights and <PERSON> Dames </PERSON> of Grace and Devotion'' are now accessible to those without noble ancestry. About 60 percent of the order's members today do not come from nobility, <PERSON> Jannone </PERSON> said. Since 1834 the order has been based in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where it owns a 16th century palace on Via <LOCATION> Condotti </LOCATION> in the heart of the shopping district and a four-acre villa on the <LOCATION> Aventine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The site is a favorite spot for Romans and tourists, who can peek through a gate keyhole down a cypress-lined path that frames the dome of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica in the distance. The order took on its military-chivalric character to defend pilgrims and the Christian kingdom against Moslem attacks. The knights were forced out of the Holy Land at the end of the 13th century, eventually settling in <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION>, where they became a naval power in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. They were driven from <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION> by the Ottoman Turks in the 16th century and moved to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, which they turned into an island fortress and a thriving center of Christianity and trade. The knights stayed in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> until 1798, when the island was captured by French Emperor <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>. Before settling in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the order temporarily came under control of Czar <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> I of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and shuttled among <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Catania </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>. Among their activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> run free clinics at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and a family dispensary in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They also give financial aid to <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and Project Hope. In recent years the order has been waging a legal battle against some 22 groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that use similar names and titles and demand high fees and contributions. The real knights say they collect minimal dues but that members are expected to contribute generously to the order's projects. The order has filed suits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts against the `` false groups,'' but all the cases have apparently been dropped, <PERSON> Jannone </PERSON> said.

 A 11 year-old boy suspended from school for refusing to tame his Mohawk haircut blamed school officials Thursday for blowing the issue out of proportion. `` None of the kids make fun of me,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngs </PERSON>, a sixth-grader at <ORGANIZATION> Sackets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of them like it and want one.'' `` It's the teachers that do n't like it,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clifta </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngs </PERSON> do n't like their son's haircut, but they're willing to go to court to defend his right to keep it. School officials in this small town on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> believe <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>'s haircut is disrupting classes. He was suspended for five days this week after his parents refused to promise that he would change it. Superintendent <PERSON> Alson </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said he considers <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>'s haircut to be as disruptive as `` extremely short shorts'' or `` see-through blouses. `` More time is spent talking about the hairdo than working on the things they -LRB- students -RRB- should be working on,'' <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said. `` We want a safe, predictable environment in the classroom.'' `` I think what I'm doing is right,'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> said. `` I can wear my hair any way I want. This is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, reached at home Thursday, said that about three months ago he and three buddies asked their parents to give them Mohawk haircuts. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>'s mom did his. `` It's brush-cut on top, long in the back and shaved on the sides,'' he said. The boys' parents received letters March 16 from Principal <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagoner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> saying their sons would be suspended if they did n't change the styles. All but <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>'s parents complied. `` Teachers do not want to take his class to assembly programs, have guest speakers come in or go on field trips,'' <PERSON> Wagoner </PERSON>'s letter said `` They are saying they would rather forego the embarrassment to themselves and the school.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> regulations, principals or superintendents have the authority to intervene in disruptive manners of dress, said <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Zongrone </PERSON>, a staff member with the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Parents can appeal the decision, which may ultimately be decided by the courts. School district attorney <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Willbanks </PERSON> said the district would decide by Monday whether to impose another suspension or possibly expel <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Youngs </PERSON> said she only requires that <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> wash his hair daily and keep it neat. `` It's clean, it's neat, it's short,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Youngs </PERSON>. `` I do n't feel there's anything wrong with it. If he wants it, he can keep it.''

 White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said today that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arrangement for leasing a $ 2.5 million Bel Air estate was `` beyond legitimate criticism'' and that the first family `` may not like'' all the publicity about the deal. The White House refused to say how much <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, will pay for the posh home where they will move when he leaves office. Real estate sources, however, estimate the fair-market value at $ 12,000 to $ 15,000 a month. Without providing any figures, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will pay a fair-market rental. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, talking with reporters at the seaside hotel where he is staying during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vacation, was asked if there was any appearance of impropriety in the leasing deal. `` I do n't think so,'' he replied. `` The White House, the president and the first lady went to great lengths to make sure that this was an arms-length transaction, that there was a full appraisal of the rental price of this property and that all of the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed, and the president and the first lady have handled this in precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate criticism of the transaction,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were upset by publicity about the house, he said, `` Oh, I do n't think so. I think after eight years they've come to understand that that occurs, and while they understand it, they may not like it, but they are not angry about it. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to say how much the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> would pay under a three-year lease that took effect March 1. `` There is no federal requirement to divulge the amount of the lease rental,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> realty firm of <ORGANIZATION> Stan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said the fair market value for a 6,500 square-foot home in that neighborhood would be $ 15,000 a month. Realtor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>, who lives in the neighborhood, estimated the cost at $ 12,000 a month. The single-story, ranch-style home, with three bedrooms, six baths and a heated swimming pool, is situated on 1 \ acres in <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in one of the most expensive areas of the state Located at 668 St. Cloud Road, the home is near the <LOCATION> Kirkeby </LOCATION> estate where the television show <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillbillies </PERSON> was filmed. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' neighbors will include celebrities such as <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacharach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>. Real estate agents say the value of the home has shot up since it was purchased in 1986 for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> by a consortium of about 20 people, who have incorporated as the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> firm of <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the value of the land alone could be as much as $ 3 million now The rental fee and the terms of the lease were negotiated by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> and the owners, based on fair-market rental estimates from two independent appraisers, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Prior to buying the property, the proposed owners obtained a legal opinion from the Office of Government Ethics. The ethics office said `` any potential lease or sale of the house to the president and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will comply with standards of conduct regulations and conflict of interest statutes so long as the president pays a fair market rental or purchase price for the house,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' lease gives them the option to renew the agreement or purchase the house, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. No purchase price terms are set in the lease, he added. The spokesman said the lease allows the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> `` to make further decisions about the home once the president is out of office and has exact knowledge of the assets and income in his blind trust.'' The house is expected to be ready for occupancy in late 1988, before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> moves out of the White House next Jan. 20.

<HEAD>US, EEC Clash On How To Balance World Food Situation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European officials disagreed Thursday over how to prevent food surpluses from building up in the developed nations when much of the Third World goes hungry. The two-day World Food Conference, organized by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, brought together 200 agriculture and development experts to discuss the problem of surplus food output in parts of the world and continuing shortages elsewhere. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said only an end to farm subsidies `` will bring about the necessary reform.'' Continuing current policies, `` will inevitably lead to greater surpluses, more wasted resources ... more disincentives for economic expansion in developing countries and more trade confrontation,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told the delegates. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking an end to all state aids to farmers by 2000 in the current round of trade liberalization talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal was `` neither possible nor desirable.'' `` Some form of stabilization and protectionism ... will always be needed,'' given the unpredictability of food production. He said the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed in February to curb its runaway growth of farm output through production ceilings and penalties for overproducers. He termed this `` a major contribution'' toward restoring a balance between supply and demand. He added, `` European farmers expect a similar action by other producing areas.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> are the world's largest food producers. Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> appealed for an end to `` economic parochialism'' and greater liberalization of world trade. He urged the developed nations to put aside national differences. `` We have to move from blind protectionism to ... regional and finally global harmonized free movement of goods and services,'' he said. `` The social and economic world order ... can no longer permit undue overemphasis on what I wish to call economic parochalism.'' <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> urged food producers not to dump `` surplus stocks on us through food aid'' but to help the Third World become self-sufficient. Concessions to Third World producers, he said, `` must be seen as a major incentive for promoting self-reliance in development more appropriate than food aid.'' The delegates to the conference hope to adopt a common statement at the end. A preliminary draft obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> calls on key food producing nations to switch from accross-the-board food price subsidies to income supports for needy farmers. Ending subsidies, the draft said, should be joint effort by all industrial nations. Delegates said the draft, if adopted, would echo the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s views, rather than the more radical ones of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as a way to come to grips with the imbalance in supply and demand <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in seeking a way out of the world's farm trade problems through <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, prefered a `` multilateral solution. It would, however, `` continue to support <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture vigorously ... if fair trade can not be achieved multilaterally,'' he added. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for a radical end to farm subsidies was backed by <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> which said `` agricultural export subsidies and measures with equivalent effect should be phased out over the next 10 years.'' It added the developed nations should rid themselves of food surpluses through lower prices for farmers, giving food to its own needy citizens and those in the world's poor regions. Western food must be given to developing nations in emergency cases only, the group said in a paper. `` Long-term Western food aid carries the disadvantage that it competes with ... locally grown food.'' It criticized as unfair to the Third World the repeated EEC efforts to tax imports of oils and fats and to pay <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> farmers a bonus to use some of their cereal output as animal feed.

Working separately, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Montagnier </PERSON> both discovered the deadly virus and helped develop blood tests to detect infection. `` There would be no mistake in thinking that the methodology has been established by the two doctors for the control of an infectious disease which has become a major problem of the 20th Century,'' the prize committee said. `` In parts of the world -LRB- AIDS -RRB- is akin to genocide,'' <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said in accepting the prize at the National Theater. `` It is global, and mostly, it destroys the young.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Isao </PERSON> <PERSON> Arita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> shared $ 200,000 for their work on smallpox. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declared the disease eradicated in 1980, three years after the last patient was reported in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. Vendryes was awarded $ 400,000. The Japan Prize, awarded in two categories each year since 1985, rewards scientific and technological achievements that contribute to world peace and prosperity. Previous prizes have gone to five Americans, an Indian and an Israeli.

<HEAD>Two More Victims Added To Green River Serial-Killer List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two names have been added to the official list of victims of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial-killer, police said. The latest identified victim in the nation's largest unsolved serial-murder case is <PERSON> Tammie </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Liles </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION>, whose skeletal remains were found in <LOCATION> Tualatin </LOCATION>, Ore. The bodies of Ms. <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> and an unidentified female were dumped in a wooded area near the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Tualatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Police </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> task force. The unidentified remains also were added to the list Thursday. The official tally of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims stands at 39, and nine other missing women are believed to be victims. The case takes its name from the river south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where the bodies of the first five victims were found in 1982. Many of the victims have had histories of prostitution, and many were known to frequent the <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> strip near <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Liles </PERSON>, who was believed to be working as a prostitute, disappeared in June 1983, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. She was identified last month when her family contacted the task force to report her missing, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. She was identified March 8 through dental records by the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodall </PERSON>, the spokesman for the <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office, said last month that Ms. <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> was reported as a runaway in April 1983. The sheriff's office followed up the report several months later, he said, and the family said Ms. <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> was living in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and planning to get married. `` We cleared her from runaway status -LRB- in May 1984 -RRB- based on that information,'' <PERSON> Woodall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said police now believe the family was misinformed. Two other victims on the official list also were found in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Those bodies were found in June 1985 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, four miles from the site of the <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> body.

<HEAD>EPA Says Seven More Priority Toxic Waste Sites Cleaned Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it plans to declare seven more `` Superfund'' toxic dump sites cleaned up. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says it has completed work at 37 sites, and has declared 13 clean since the cleanup effort began seven years ago. At another seven sites, all work as been completed except groundwater pumping for purification, which may continue for years or decades. Often chided for the small number of cleanups completed, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says such `` maintenance'' pumping will continue to keep the number of `` walkaway'' cleanups small. Two more sites were chosen for a cleanup declaration last month. Those two and the seven announced Thursday are subject to public comment before the declaration is made formally. The agency has estimated that there may be 25,000 sites needing attention. Most are small, but 951 have been chosen for a priority list eligible for federal cleanup funds from the Superfund program. Some 149 of those have not been formally placed on the list. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says it has completed 604 initial site investigations, decided on a cleanup method for 230 and has done some actual cleanup work, as opposed to mere paperwork, at 189 sites, frequently as a temporary measure until a cleanup can be completed or a method decided on. Actual cleanups are currently under way at 60 sites. Here are the seven sites in Thursday's announcement: _ <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, `` Valley of the Drums,'' a former chemical dump and drum recycling center 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> where work began in 1979, the year before enactment of the Superfund program Some 17,000 drums had to removed. _ <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Lane landfill in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, 125 acres of old quarry used for chemical disposal from 1948 to 1975 _ Galloway Pits, <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a 10-acre site where illegal pesticide disposal was discovered in 1982 _ <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, former municipal dump _ <ORGANIZATION> Mowbray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, site at <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where electrical transformers had been renovated _ <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electroplating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> site near <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where an electroplating plant operated in the 1970s _ <LOCATION> Presque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, an abandoned gas well at <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION> The <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and Salem sites were designated by the state governors several years ago as the worst in their states. The sites announced last month, both in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, are <ORGANIZATION> Tri-City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservationist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, where waste oil was reclaimed, and an underground solvent spill at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> called the Varsol spill site.

<HEAD>Simon's Statement As He Suspends His Presidential Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s statement Thursday as he suspended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination I am today suspending my campaign for the presidency. I'm grateful to all who have campaigned with me and for me. And I leave the field of active campaigning with no regrets for having made the race. No regrets, first, because it has been an exhilarating experience to get to know our nation better, both our difficulties and our potential. I understand more fully the plight of native Americans in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the nuclear energy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the similarities and difficulties that farmers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> share with their <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> counterparts, the isolation of a small city in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> in winter, the disfigurement oil rigs could cause to the magnificent coastline of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the sadness of unemployment in <LOCATION> Starr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the wasted humanity in too much of our nation. But I've also come to know better a nation with potential, a nation that is limited not by our talent and resources, but by our dreams and our leadership. Where I have had the opportunity to reach people I have seen them respond with a selflessness that must be tapped. Americans instinctively know that we are one nation, one family, and when anyone in that family hurts, all of us eventually hurt. There really is a yearning across this land for leadership that appeals to the noble in us rather than the greed in us. I wish I had been able to tap that yearning more effectively. But to the extent my supporters and I have been able to reach out and talk about programs and a vision of a better nation, to that extent we have helped to make possible the building of a better nation. For that, I am grateful to far too many people to be acknowledged here, but they include my wife <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, a superb campaigner; my daughter <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Knop </PERSON>, who were married Sept. 12, and have since been honeymooning in places like Audubon, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sturgeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and my son, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, my traveling companion, photographer and consultant. No candidate could have stronger family support. To the staff of my campaign, who worked long hours for limited pay, to our chairman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Manatt </PERSON>, and the countless volunteers, more volunteers than any other campaign, who are unbelievable in their efforts; to those who raised money against great odds, to a host of others I should be acknowledging my gratitude. And to the people of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> who have been both supportive and understanding, my full efforts will now be devoted to being your senator, and I shall be a better senator because of this rich experience. The Polish writer, <PERSON> Kazimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandys </PERSON>, tells a story of two who were approached during a period of ferment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and asked to protest the illegal arrest and imprisonment of a leading intellectual. One refused to sign and said, `` I ca n't. I have a son.'' The other immediately took out his pen and said, `` I have to sign because I have a son.'' Both acts are understandable. But the legacy of honor that one leaves is vastly different than the other. I entered this race beause I have a daughter and a son. I entered this race because I have had the good fortune to understand the vast difference in the lives of millions of people action by government can make.

 School officials at <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, who knew I helped create the law requiring that those with disabilities be given a chance by our public schools, arranged for a chorus of retarded young people to sing for me. They recited the preamble to the Constitution in unison, and then sang, `` This is My Country.'' I glanced at the reporters covering the event, and noted the moist eyes. We all had them. Without that change in the law, probably half of those young people would be in institutions today. Government is not the enemy. Government is simply a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely. In passing that law, we used it wisely, compassionately. `` To form a more perfect union,'' these students recited from the Constitution, a goal partially achieved but in large measure still unattained. We can do better, my friends. I entered this race because I want this generation to give the coming generations a sound economy, not an uncontrollable debt. I entered this race because I see a nation indifferent to the wasted lives of far too many; children in schools where fear dominates rather than learning; older citizens and their families financially devastated by long-term care needs; hard-working farmers devastated by short-sighted government policies; people eager to work who can not find a job, lose pride in themselves and their families and their nation; and communities gripped by the terror of crime. I entered this race because I know that the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can lead our nation and other nations away from the arms race. The blight of the arms race, and unemployment, and crime, and inadequate health care, and educational shortcomings are not the results of God, but the result of insensitive leadership _ chosen by a people who sometimes are not as caring nor as careful as they might be. I know we can do better. You know we can do better. I want leadership that will provide that. After the last primary on June 7, I will meet with my delegates to determine what course should be followed. In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows what twists and turns may develop between now and then. There will be many encounters with fate before the contest is ultimately decided in a wide-open convention. For that reason, while I am ceasing all campaigning, I will make no decision formally withdrawing as a candidate until after June 7, though I have no illusions that the nomination will come my way. But I want my delegates to have a voice in this nation's future. We will weigh the options then. I want to be in a position to do everything I can to help unify the party, and, ultimately, the nation. I'm grateful to those who've contributed to the nation's dialogue who have withdrawn _ <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> And I'm appreciative of the efforts already made and still to be made by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. All three have been working hard, discussing and refining the issues, sharpening our knowledge and challenging our conscience. Delegates to the convention probably will select one of these three who have come to know this nation well. To those who have already asked the inevitable question, `` Will you run in 1992?'' I have two responses. First, I expect to campaign for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president for re-election in 1992. Second, running for president is a little like taking an ice-cold shower. It's a great one-time experience but I have no yearning for a repeat performance. But we have a great nation, and all of us working together can make it a better nation. Thank you.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is pleased with news of an agreement that could lead to the beginning next month of a Soviet Army withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s agreement with Afghan leaders clearing the way for settlement of the 10-year-old Afghan war `` is a step forward.'' But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` wants to see the fine print. He wants to see the details of the arrangement. He wants to know the reaction and the interpretation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` So the president is cautiously optimistic,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters outside a seaside resort hotel here. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said Wednesday that planning for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` is on track'' and wo n't be derailed by any continuing Soviet military presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a briefing that also touched on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will `` press the case'' for a pullout if Soviet occupation forces are still in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the summit begins May 29. But in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leaders announced today that they had resolved problems blocking a settlement, and the Soviets offered to start pulling troops out of the country on May 15 if agreement is reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on the terms for that withdrawal. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said today that `` we've got to examine that communique carefully. We've had no direct communication, I think, from the Soviets so far.'' The chief of staff said the agreement `` may very well lead to a resolution of these issues and a pullout of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, told reporters that `` it is a step forward and the Soviets themselves say that they think conditions are present so that they could begin the pullout on the 15th of May, and we hope that is the case.'' `` But we have to see the final document, and we have to have formal response from the Soviets to our questions of last week,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. He said, `` I think it's important to reinforce our position that there has to be symmetry in the arrangements between us and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, so that as long as they are able to continue providing military aid to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime, we will retain the right to provide military aid'' to the Afghan rebels. Asked Wednesday whether a continuing Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> could sabotage the summit, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` That might be an even better reason to go.'' `` The summit is on track and there are a number of issues the president will push while he is in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. ... And if we do n't have action to pull the troops out of -LRB- <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -RRB- by the time we go, I think that would ... probably move to the very top of the president's agenda,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said Wednesday that it is difficult to say whether Soviet troops will be withdrawn by the time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Discussing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to force Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said another 800 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines will be sent to the Central American nation. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> insisted that the movement of the Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to a jungle training facility at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has nothing to do with the increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military show of force there. `` This unit training deployment has been scheduled since December,'' he said. `` These -LRB- troops -RRB- will be there for three weeks and they'll come out.'' On other topics, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> cautioned against concluding that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to grant pardons to former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who have been indicted in the Iran-Contra case. A congressman who attended a March 22 meeting quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying `` I like the sound of those words,'' when someone in the meeting broached the possibility of pardons. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that the remark seemed to indicate that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> favors pardons for his former top aides, but he said, `` I do n't believe you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the basis of that throwaway comment.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American authorities, often aided by friendly foreign governments, have had some successes lately luring or forcing criminal suspects out of safe havens abroad into the long arms of the law. Some people call it kidnapping, but federal courts have generally approved the practice. The latest dramatic case occurred this week when Honduran police acting on information from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals arrested alleged international cocaine czar <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> at his home in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and started him on a plane journey that ended in the federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, who escaped from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jail in 1971 and has been charged with subsequent drug offenses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also was sought for questioning in the murder of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agent Honduran legislators, citing a law against extradition of Honduran citizens, labeled the transfer a kidnapping, but the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> called it `` a major milestone in our worldwide assault on illegal drug trafficking.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has extradition treaties with more than 100 countries, but each accord is different and some require long and often fruitless court proceedings that frustrate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agents' desire to get their hands on suspects. Getting other countries to help by using what are euphemistically called `` non-diplomatic means'' _ as in the <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> case _ are common, law enforcement authorities say, though no statistics on such arrests are published. Police jokingly refer to these methods as `` Mexican Extraditions,'' a reference to the longstanding Mexican practice of shooing suspects wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> across the border, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> police are waiting. In the <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> case, two countries helped. The Hondurans put him on a plane to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without a passport. Officials in that country expelled him by placing him aboard a flight bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals aboard the aircraft arrested him immediately. Last year, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, a reputed drug kingpin from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the request of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Sometimes, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> captures people abroad without overt assistance from foreign nations. Last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, undercover agents tracking <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a suspect in the 1985 hijacking of a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> aircraft, tricked him into going aboard a yacht in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and arrested him under a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law giving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> courts jurisdiction to try suspected terrorists who act against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> is awaiting trial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In 1982, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who had fled to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> after being indicted on weapons sales charges, was duped by an acquaintance into flying to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Authorities there put him on a non-stop flight to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he was arrested. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, the drug culture guru who escaped in 1970 from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jail, was turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agents in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> even though the two countries had no extradition treaty. Defense attorneys in some of the celebrated cases _ notably the <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> cases _ have sought dismissal of charges on grounds the overseas arrests violated the defendants' rights by, in effect, kidnapping them. Those requests, however, generally have been denied. The courts have said the manner of a suspect's arrest _ even an abduction _ is not relevant in assessing guilt or innocence. The only exception, based on a plea by a defendant brought back from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> in the 1960s, would be a case in which the suspect's treatment, such as torture, was so outrageous it `` shocked the conscience'' of the court Even then, a suspect would have to prove it was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities who committed the torture. Despite success in capturing such suspects as <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, other big fish have eluded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> net. Since 1974, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to extradite fugitive financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> to prosecute him on charges of looting $ 224 million from an international investor's fund. <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> first went to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. He has since emerged in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, beyond the reach of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> police.

<HEAD>Important Art Collection Finds Temporary Home In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bulk of one of the world's most important private art collections will hang in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for at least 10 years under an agreement signed Thursday. The arrival of 700 to 800 of the $ 2 billion <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> collection's most significant paintings will cement the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> capital's reputation as a leading world art The agreement was signed by collector <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Thyssen-Bornemisza </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government. The ceremony took place across the street from <LOCATION> Prado </LOCATION> museum in the 19th-century Villahermosa Palace, which Spanish authorities are refurbishing to devote exclusively to the new works. The collection is expected to open to the public in November. <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> said his decision to chose <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> over museums in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was `` completely objective'' but stressed that his ties to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> played a deciding role. The Baron's fifth wife, Spanish-born <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervera </PERSON>, was an important factor in the final decision, according one of the plan's chief architects, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Badajoz </ORGANIZATION>, who also is the brother-in-law of King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervera </PERSON>, a former beauty queen and widow of `` Tarzan'' actor <PERSON> Lex </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, `` has a great influence over her husband,'' he said. The duke said <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> had not yet completed the choice of which paintings would make up the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> collection, but the agreement stipulates they include `` the most significant paintings'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> collection. The duke said the 10-year loan agreement paves the way for a second pact to make <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> the collection's permanent home. `` It takes away a bit of the tension,'' he said. `` Now we can proceed with calm to work out the definitive agreement.'' A beaming Culture Minister <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Solana </PERSON> said the collection `` is going to fundamentally improve the cultural life of our country.'' The Swiss-based <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen-Bornemisza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, headed by the baron, owns 1,600 paintings from the 13th to 20th centuries, including 570 old masters. The collection was started by his father, <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Thyssen-Bornemisza </PERSON>, a German steel baron who died in 1947. News that <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> was looking for a bigger home for the bulk of the paintings currently housed at his <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Favorita </ORGANIZATION> residence in <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, elicited offers from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Getty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and museums in several West German cities. The 10-year loan is to be administered by a private foundation set up by the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION>, and chaired by the baron. The agreement stipulates that the pieces on loan to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> will be able to travel freely to other museums without prior approval from <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> authorities.

<TEXT>
 The health minister of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> set fire to a pile of 35,000 cigarette butts on Thursday, Roman youths gave tourists apples for their smokes, and Chinese tried ointments and shock therapy to get through a day without tobacco. Thursday was the first worldwide `` No Tobacco Day,'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It coincided with the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agency and was designed to urge people to stop smoking or using chewing tobacco. Anti-smoking activists drove around the northern Japanese city of Hokkaido in a car equipped with a loudspeaker asking smokers to be considerate of non-smokers. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> showed grim footage of patients on a cancer ward. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which introduced cigars and cigarettes to much of the world more than 300 years ago, officials in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> sponsored contests for the best anti-smoking posters. The WHO campaign had no apparent effect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, however. The streets and sidewalk cafes of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> were filled with smokers, despite radio broadcasts and posters denouncing the perils of puffing tobacco. `` Because of the civil war, the number of smokers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has increased dramatically,'' said <PERSON> Soha </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamim </PERSON>, a public health officer at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war has raged since 1975. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, WHO Director General <PERSON> Halfdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> said tobacco use `` is tantamount to slow-motion suicide.'' He urged smokers and other tobacco users to stop for the day and then extend that `` into a week, a month, a year.'' The WHO awarded 40 medals to people and organizations it said promoted the idea of a tobacco-free society. They included former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, the cigarette butts were collected by volunteers of the <ORGANIZATION> Nepal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The health minister, Mrs. <PERSON> Shushila </PERSON> <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON>, lighted the pile during a ceremony in an open theater in the center of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>. Major stores in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> stopped selling cigarettes for the day, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. In front of the Museum of Chinese History facing the central Tiananmen Square, educational stands were set up to help smokers who wanted to quit. Stalls sold `` anti-smoking ointment,'' `` restrain-and-stop-smoking drops,'' herbs and even a `` quit smoking mouth gargle'' to deter smoking. A cancerous lung, encased in plastic, also was on display. For the really desperate, merchants were offering the `` longevity brand electrotherapy device for helping give up smoking and protecting health.'' The device, which sold for about $ 4, consists of battery-powered electrodes attached to the cheeks and is activated every time the user gets the urge for a smoke. There was no indication whether <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous chain-smoker, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, complied with the government's request to stop smoking for a day. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has 300 million smokers, the world's highest number. From the Pantheon to the <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Veneto </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, volunteers handed out baskets of apples with the message `` A piece of fruit is OK, but cigarette smoke is n't. An apple goes farther than the cigarette.'' They also walked around town asking smokers to put out their cigarettes in exchange for flowers or apples. Colorfully dressed women in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, collected money for the fight against cancer. One of them who stood in <LOCATION> Calvin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> downtown said she collected the equivalent of more than $ 200 from passersby. According to WHO, 2.5 million people die each year from tobacco-related diseases, including lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and heart disease. WHO says this represents one death every 13 seconds. The organization estimates that, in industrialized countries, one-third of all people over 15 are smokers, while in the Third World about half of all males and 10 percent of females over 15 are smokers. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a former supporter of the tobacco industry, was given an award for his `` candid change of views'' that led him to write in 1986 that he had become `` increasingly active in attempting to spare people from the tobacco addiction,'' <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, star of the TV series `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' was commended for serving as chairman for eight years of the `` Great American Smokeout.'' WHO said that due to his influence, tobacco is never portrayed on `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was honored for pledging in 1981 never to smoke in public and subsequently quitting. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which is known worldwide for its fine cigars, participated in the no-smoking day. Despite being a major tobacco producer, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has launched a strong anti-smoking campaign. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was praised for being the first carrier in the world to fly regular smoke-free routes internationally, and <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> `` for introducing the smoke-free four-hour flight in 1978, and for being the first to make all internal flights smoke-free, from January 1982.'' In July, South African Airways banned smoking on all domestic flights.

 Police found the body of a kidnapped Dutch tycoon buried in a forest after his abductor admitted murdering his captive seven months ago and led authorities to the grave, officials said Thursday. The discovery Wednesday night of the body of grocery baron <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> ended the nation's longest kidnap case. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s body was dug up near the northeastern village of <LOCATION> Renkum </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bot </PERSON>, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office An unemployed architect admitted kidnapping <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>, 56, on Sept. 9, 1987, and shooting him to death a few hours later, <PERSON> Bot </PERSON> said. Most of the ransom of 8 million guilders -LRB- about $ 4.3 million -RRB- and 1,200 diamonds paid by <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s family was found in the suspect's home, along with the gun used to kill <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bot </PERSON> said. The case became known as the `` Heijn Affair'' and, despite a news blackout, dominated headlines throughout the nation. It is the first modern Dutch kidnapping case in which a prominent victim was killed. In line with police procedure, authorities refused to identify the suspect except by his initials, P.E. They said he lived in the village of <LOCATION> Landsmeer </LOCATION>, a few miles north of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and about 75 miles from where <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> was buried. The 45-year-old architect was arrested early Wednesday at home, police said. Bot said police also took into custody the man's wife and his three children, aged 17 to 25, but he said it was unclear if they had any role in the crime. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> was kidnapped at gunpoint Sept. 9 as he left his home for a dentist's appointment. He was vice-chairman of the family-run <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION> grocery concern, which operates the nation's largest supermarket chain, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION> also owns the <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bi-Lo </ORGANIZATION> stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The suspect told police he waited for <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> outside the family villa in the affluent <PERSON> Bloemendaal </PERSON> suburb, drove <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> to the forest in a stolen car and shot the executive in the head, <ORGANIZATION> Bot </ORGANIZATION> said. The suspect told interrogators he then cut off one of <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s little fingers and buried him later that day, <PERSON> Bot </PERSON> said Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Geelof </PERSON> said in an interview with Dutch television that police picked up the suspect's trail after the discovery of a 250-guilder note from the ransom payment early this year at a Landsmeer bank. The banknote was traced back to a supermarket in northern <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, which was then put under police surveillance, <PERSON> Geelof </PERSON> said. Several weeks after the first banknote surfaced, another 250-guilder note was spent at the supermarket by one of those now under arrest, according to <PERSON> Geelof </PERSON>. The suspect's house was then put under police surveillance. The <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Het </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parool </ORGANIZATION> said the suspect had been living on welfare after several small businesses he started failed. <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION> communicated with the abductors through a series of coded advertisements in Dutch newspapers, and the ransom was paid on Nov. 27. In early October, <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s little finger was mailed to <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Frits </PERSON> <PERSON> Korthals </PERSON> <PERSON> Altes </PERSON> said in December that <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> was presumed dead. There was no indication that <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> knew the suspect, police said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he talked Thursday with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, whose elusive endorsement he described as `` relevant'' to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary voters despite <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s opinion otherwise. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been courting a <LOCATION> Cuomo </LOCATION> endorsement for months, said his discussion with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was `` a very pleasant conversation.'' `` I'm sure we will be speaking frequently,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Asked if he felt a <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> endorsement would still be helpful with less than two weeks to go before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` Sure it's relevant. People in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and across this country care very deeply about what Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> thinks and what other governors think. As I said the other day, that is a decision that he has to make. I respect it.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who appears to be leaning toward no endorsement, said Thursday his opinion means less and less as the primary approaches. `` Who cares what ... <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says?'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to put his presidential campaign on hold brings heightened attention to the trio of Democratic hopefuls remaining. `` As I said to somebody the other day,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said with a smile, `` it suddenly struck me Tuesday night that this was all getting kind of serious.'' The governor told a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> news conference that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision Thursday `` means that those of us who continue to be strong contenders are going to be looked at, observed, and listened to even more carefully and more intensively. `` So it's for me, I think, another step in the road, and I hope a good step in the sense that I've got an opportunity now to take my case to the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and ask them to make some choices among the three candidates that now remain.'' Asked about <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s refusal to release his 170 delegates, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` It is his decision really as to what happens now with respect to his delegates. Obviously, I want every delegate I can get.''

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Thursday that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is a possible partner for peace talks and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should take its cue from him. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who is nearing the end of an arduous <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace shuttle, returned from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for more talks with the king and lauded <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s `` constructive'' approach to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan for the second day in a row. Indirectly applying pressure on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` the message of that to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is here is a possible Arab partner in negotiations.'' But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who returns home Friday, acknowledged `` it remains to be seen whether that can evolve'' into peace talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> remains opposed to an international peace conference, which <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has demanded as a precondition to negotiations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he was able to put `` a little life'' into his peace plan since starting out in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. But he said, `` I do n't want to exaggerate the progress that has been made.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative calls for negotiations in two stages. The first would seek to establish some self-rule for Palestinians who live in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The second would deal with the settlement of the 40-year <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Four months of anti-occupation rioting in the occupied lands have left more than 140 Palestinians and two Israelis dead. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke to reporters in al-Bareeda after an audience with Saudi King Fahd in a palace about 300 miles north of the capital, <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. He said the king encouraged him to pursue Arab-Israeli negotiations. `` I found a great measure of support and encouragement,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. On another subject, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was nearing an agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that would permit both sides to keep arming rival factions. `` Its an end-game situation,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, but he declined to verify reports that a deal had already been struck. `` We are in very active touch,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he took up with the Saudis their purchase of ballistic missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has alarmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as possibly sparking an escalation of missile arsenals throughout the region. The rockets, delivered surreptitiously, can strike <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and range even beyond. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters aboard <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s flight to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> gave assurances that the missiles were non-nuclear: `` Non-today, non-tomorrow, non-forever.'' He declined to say whether the Saudis gave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> permission to inspect the sites. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> assurances it would not launch a pre-emptive strike against the missiles. The purchase angered a group of 30 senators who have threatened to try to block further arms sales to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration apparently intends to go ahead with its plan to provide new equipment for U.S.-built AWACS radar planes. `` That's obviously got great value,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, defending the deal. In contrast to <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> efforts, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> evidently has made headway with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> over a new constitution for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said he had `` quite constructive discussions'' with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The Syrians evidently are prepared to help devise new constitutional guidelines that would rearrange the division of power among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s warring factions. Describing the plight of the country, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official traveling with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> recalled that `` people said a year ago, two years ago, this is anarchy, total anarchy. Two years later, it's worse. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s kind words for <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> contrasted with his cool approach to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. On Wednesday, he urged <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to regard negotiations with his neighbors as the most fundamental element in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. In an interview with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> lauded <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as `` a man of peace'' and said the questions he posed about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan showed he was engaged in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort. Sizing up his five-day visit, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` I think it's been worthwhile and we've made a little progress here and there. But it comes very hard and slow and I do n't want to exaggerate the progress that has been made. But it is important to keep at it.''

 A statue showing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in mid-stride was unveiled Thursday as the winner of a competition to select an official memorial to the late president in his home state. His daughter, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON>, unveiled a three-foot plaster model of the bronze planned for the front lawn of the Statehouse. The finished bronze sculpture that will be the state's official memorial to <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> is scheduled to be unveiled May 29, 1989, which would have been his 72nd birthday. It will stand a short distance from a statue of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, the Republican whose son <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> defeated in 1952 in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign that launched his national career. `` There are many memorials to my father in this country and around the world,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON> said. `` But of all of them, this one in the state he loved means the most.'' The winning design in a year-long competition was executed by artist <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlvain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. It shows <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in what members of the selection commission called a classic pose _ mid-stride, eyes forward, elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit pocket. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strode into the ceremony a few minutes late to speak about how <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> inspired his own entrance into politics and, ultimately, his bid this year for the Democratic presidential nomination. Echoing some of the things critics have said about himself, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>: `` People said he was too young, he could n't carry the South, he had a religious burden.'' Longtime <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, a member of the committee that selected the winning scupture, told stories about the 1960 <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> campaign during which the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator startled some visitors with his voice exercises, designed to prevent him from losing his voice at a critical time. Powers said the sculpture reminded him of what E.B. White once wrote of Kennedy: `` He never feared the weather. ... Instead he challenged the wind, to change its direction and to cause it to blow more kindly and more softly over the world and its people.'' Another commitee member, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozol </PERSON>, said she liked Ms. <PERSON> McIlvain </PERSON>'s design because `` there's steadiness, a composure reflected there.'' A fund drive to raise $ 150,000 to build the eight-foot bronze statue began officially Thursday when state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> gave the memorial organizers a check for $ 1,000 from his own campaign fund. House Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON>, the original mover behind the Kennedy memorial commission, said he was proud that none of the money needed to execute the bronze would come from the public treasury. <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON>, a frequent jokester, added that with the state's current tight fiscal situation and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential aspirations, the private fund-raiser was a particularly good idea. `` We want to keep the economic miracle alive in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> at least until November,'' <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> said. For three months, five small clay models of the proposed statues have been on display at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section The other four finalists were by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Markham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Jencks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Legassie </PERSON> of Old Lyme, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Each artist received $ 4,000 to make the models. <PERSON> McIlvain </PERSON>, who attended the ceremony, said she looked forward to executing the bronze. `` I'm delighted to be doing this,'' she said.

 The stakes in the afternoon bingo games were n't exactly high: 75 cents for the first win and a candy bar for the second. But senior citizen centers here have called them off because they're illegal. <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crosse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging, blew the whistle on the unlicensed games. `` I ca n't understand it,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Beguin </PERSON>, director of the <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> Senior Center. `` Nobody can. We've played bingo for 25 years. The center's been in operation for 25 years.'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, who runs a less-popular variation of bingo on Sundays involving food prizes and called `` prizo,'' said she felt she had to report the weekday games. `` I thought I was doing my duty,'' she said Wednesday. `` It is illegal, as you are well aware, to advertise bingo and to play for cash without a license.'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> wrote a letter to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> March 11 informing him of the games. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> responded to <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>'s letter on March 22, agreeing that a license is needed. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> forwarded <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s letter to the senior centers. A license costs $ 10 for each bingo session, plus $ 10 in annual fees, according to <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, one of the bingo control board members with the state office in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. But center officials say the games barely break even, so the state fees would be too much to pay. `` It's not the kind of activity that any prosecutor's office or police agency is going to go out and make arrests for,'' <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` Clearly something can be worked out that could make this legal, although at this time, technically, it is illegal,'' he said. `` Two weeks ago we quit,'' said <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Vollenweider </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't want to get in trouble or get fined.''

 Thirteen white supremacists who were tried on federal charges including murder, robbery and conspiring to set up a new nation in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> were found innocent today of all charges. An all-white jury, which reported itself deadlocked on several counts Wednesday, returned the verdict on its fourth day of deliberations. Asked how the seven-week trial affected the white supremacist movement, defendant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said, `` Who knows? What movement? What's left of it after this?'' `` The government was going to send a message to the movement. The movement sent a message to the overnment,'' said <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, the national chaplain of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON>, who hugged several of the defendants after the verdict was announced. Defendant <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> celebrated his acquittal by going to a Confederate memorial opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he called the `` Zionist occupation government.'' `` There are over 150 other political prisoners being held in <ORGANIZATION> ZOG </ORGANIZATION>'s jails that need to be freed,'' the 41-year-old <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said. `` I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today. I think everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was simply being punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of ZOG.'' Nine defendants were charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by violence. One of the nine, along with four other defendants, was charged with conspiring to kill a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. Two of the sedition defendants were accused of the interstate transportation of stolen money. On Wednesday, the jury returned a verdict in the case of five of the defendants charged with conspiracy to assassinate a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, but reported a deadlock on other counts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> told the jury to continue deliberating. During the trial, government witnesses said blacks and Jews were targets of the conspirators, some of whom hold religious beliefs that categorize <PERSON> Jews </PERSON> as `` the spawn of Satan,'' blacks as `` mud-people'' and the government and news media as under the control of Jews. The government alleged that the supremacist groups robbed banks and armored trucks of $ 4.1 million to finance their activities, including about $ 1 million that is still missing. Defendants contended that there was no conspiracy and that the conspiracy theory was made up by a key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, who led a supremacist group in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and now is serving 20 years for racketeering. According to defendants, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> made up the story to win a sentence reduction for cooperating with the government. Defendants in the sedition case included three leaders of white supremacist groups: Beam, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; Miles, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Maximum penalties for conviction include 20 years and a $ 20,000 fine for seditious conspiracy, life for conspiracy to murder, and 10 years and a $ 10,000 fine for transporting stolen money. When he arrived at the courthouse Wednesday, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> was asked if he had he ever advocated establishing an all-white nation in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. `` Only in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cohoctah </PERSON>,'' replied <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, who is pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>. Six defendants in the sedition case are serving prison sentences for other crimes. Two of them exchanged words with government witness <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> on Wednesday as they were being moved to the <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, a television producer from <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, testified during the trial's first week that he videotaped meetings involving <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> group and defendants <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> also testified about a tape-recording he secretly made of a conversation in which <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> was trying to identify some major telephone facility he could bomb. `` You pervert, homosexual, sell your pictures to Hustler,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> called out as <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> took photographs of the prisoners. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> testified that he wrote an article about his investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebel </ORGANIZATION>, a magazine owned by Hustler publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. `` Your day will come,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> shouted. `` I'll see you in 200 years, <PERSON> David </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> answered, a reference to the 190-year prison sentence <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> is serving on other charges. The government says the supremacist groups robbed banks and armored trucks of $ 4.1 million to finance their activities, including about $ 1 million that is still missing. Defendants contend that there was no conspiracy and that the conspiracy theory was invented by a key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, who led a supremacist group in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and now is serving 20 years for racketeering. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> made up the story in exchange for leniency, the defendants argue.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its warplanes sneaked through Iraqi radar into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Thursday and bombed a military base and oil refinery in the city, killing or wounding dozens of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers. It was the first reported bombing of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital in three years. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied the city was hit, but the ferocity of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attacks later gave some credence to the Iranian claims. Both sides bombarded each other's cities and towns with missiles and reported scores of civilian casualties. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to investigate Iraqi allegations that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in a March 30-31 battle in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons in the same battle. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, met with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to discuss a cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said squadrons of its fighter-bombers dodged <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s radar net and the heavy air defenses around <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> just after 6 a.m. and dropped bombs in two raids, 10 minutes apart. They were the first reported bombing raids on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, a city of 5 million, since March 1985 and came as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> marked the 41st anniverary of the founding of its ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the air raids `` completely caught the enemy by surprise.'' It said warplanes bombed the al-Doura refinery and the <PERSON> Khafaji </PERSON> military camp on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts, `` killing or wounding dozens of soldiers'' and leaving their targets on fire. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all its planes returned safely. It did not say how many were involved in the raid. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted military communiques as saying only one Iranian jet got through but was driven off by anti-aircraft fire before it could drop any bombs. It said the plane was later shot down by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> interceptors over western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In one of their most widespread missile barrages, the Iraqis reported firing 11 long-range missiles: four at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, three at the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, two at the industrial town of <LOCATION> Karaj </LOCATION>, northwest of the capital, and one each at the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION>. It was the first time <LOCATION> Karaj </LOCATION> had been hit by a missile since the war began in September 1980. In retaliation, the Iranians said they fired two long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and 13 short-range projectiles into the ports of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and Umm Qasr, an Iraqi naval base. They also reported bombing <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and Umm Qasr and the northern Iraqi city of <LOCATION> Erbil </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian warplanes attacked <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troop concentrations in <LOCATION> Al-Amara </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, and areas in the southern front. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks between Perez de Cuellar and <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> were the fourth round since the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> adopted a resolution July 20 calling for a cease-fire in the war. The issue of chemical warfare dominated the talks. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> should condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using chemical warfare and `` prevent this very criminal act.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team that arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> last week to investigate Iranian allegations that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical warfare and killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds in fighting last month. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said in a letter delivered Wednesday to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that another team of investigators should visit the village of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, where the alleged chemical warfare occurred.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> refused again Thursday to endorse any of the Democratic candidates for president and implied that he might not back anyone until the primaries are over in June. `` Who cares what ... <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says?'' the governor told reporters. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> also said he had told candidate <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that his attacks on <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be `` ineffective'' leading up to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s April 19 primary. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he talked to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Thursday morning and told the senator that his criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` was n't helping him.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said his no-more-attacks message had also been passed along to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camps.

As he has in the past, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said `` the candidate with a plurality at the end of the process should be the candidate'' of the party. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said party leaders should rally around the leader at that point and find enough votes to give him the nomination. To help with that process, it might be best to remain neutral through the primaries, said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` You're already committed and for the rest of this thing you're committed,'' he said of making an endorsement `` When they look at the whole scene at the end ... maybe at that point there should be some force.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> again refused to rule out accepting a draft for the nomination himself if there was a deadlocked convention.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Government Should Pay Parochial Schools To Teach
Tough Kids</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called on Catholic schools Thursday to enroll the `` worst 5 or 10 percent'' of public school students and ask state or local government to help pay for teaching them. His proposal, made in an address to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 85th annual convention here, was greeted warmly by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators but was challenged as unconstitutional by several leading public education groups. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> dubbed his proposal `` Project Voluntas,'' Latin for good will. Parochial schools already have done an exemplary job teaching minority students, who make up 22 percent of their 2.5 million total enrollment, he told the gathering. But he said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators have not been effective in telling outsiders how much better they've done with difficult students compared with many public schools. `` The challenge is simple,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a parochial school product himself. `` Show educators around this country what works.'' `` Seek out the poor, the disadvantaged, the disruptive, the dropout, and take them in, educate them, and then ask society for fair recompense for your efforts,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. He said Catholic schools should ask state or local governments for `` half the price, or two-thirds of the price, or something like that,'' of whatever it would have cost to teach such students in public school. Governments `` would, I believe, be receptive to constitutionally sound efforts to pay for the education of such students.'' But if government ca n't or wo n't, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` business and others in the private sector would surely want to support such a worthwhile endeavor.'' `` I think there's a good deal of possibility for it,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, director of education for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> which enrolls 180,000 kindergarten through 12th-grade students. `` We do not subscribe to the absolute separation of church and state that others who oppose us do. The so-called wall of separation is not in the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Constitution,'' he said. But `` Project Voluntas'' was condemned by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Administrators: `` Every thoughtful American should be appalled by the secretary's remarks. He constantly hits people in the public schools below the belt and they are the ones who are working hardest to deal with the problems of at-risk youth.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s proposal `` a welcome challenge to Catholic schools,'' but questioned its constitutionality. `` If the Catholic schools are going to do what they are supposed to do, that is, teach <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> beliefs in an integrated way throughout the curriculum, it would be unconstitutional on its face'' to support such schools with public funds, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s proposal is the latest of several he has advanced, largely unsuccessfully, aimed at expanding educational options including the private school sector. His ideas have included tuition tax credits and tuition vouchers that would offer tax breaks or direct assistance to parents of private school children. But with prospects bleak for tax credits or vouchers, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools to take the initiative and prove that they deserve community support. <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest teacher union, dismissed <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s idea as `` a back-door approach to finance private schools.'' `` On the one hand, he's saying that money is irrelevant to a quality education. On the other hand, he's saying the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools need more money to educate at-risk children. Which is it, Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>? Does money matter, or does n't it?'' she said. But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Catholic schools `` have often done more with less.'' Citing studies by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> sociologist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the dropout rate among parochial high school sophomores nationwide is just 3 percent, compared with 14 percent in public schools. Median tuition at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> elementary schools is about $ 700, and $ 1,500 for high schools, compared with an average of about $ 4,500 a year to educate a child in public school, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Still, he said, more than 4,000 parochial schools have closed in the last 20 years, and part of the blame is with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools themselves for being reticent in proclaiming their excellence. `` I believe that it is in your interest to take up this challenge,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` It is also in society's interest. Catholic schools should n't be closing. And disadvantaged children should be getting a good education.''

 Federal budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> pushed the idea of turning over the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to private companies Thursday, as about 100 picketing postal workers accused him of trying to destroy the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail. New Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, appearing at the same meeting, opposed the privatization idea and called for greater discretion for the service to manage its finances and set rates. Picketers said they had no dispute with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> appeared at a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Cato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative policy research organization. `` There is no good reason why -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- should remain part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and no good reason why it should enjoy a monopoly over the delivery of letter mail,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He accused the service of wanting to be a government-protected monopoly when it comes to letter mail and a federal agency when it comes to federal subsidies and other benefits. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> denied allegations from the postal unions and others that his <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> has tried to intrude into management of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is an independent government agency. He said his problem is not with the 800,000 postal workers but with the system which he said is `` not working particularly well right now.'' `` If given the opportunity to compete, I'm sure the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, including its employees, would do very well indeed,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, he's a jerk; privatization just wo n't work,'' chanted members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, who obstructed the front door of the hotel where the seminar was held until police arrived and ordered them to the sides. <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, president of the 365,000-member union, called <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s proposal `` cockeyed'' and said it would cause chaos with the mail and increase costs to the public. `` No responsible businessman has advocated privatization,'' <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> said. Wearing a sign accusing <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of betraying postal reform, <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> stood at the doorway of the seminar room for a few minutes before the budget director arrived. <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> later followed <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> into the hotel and shook his hand, saying he wanted to debate him. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who took over the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> March 1, said it should not be operated for profit. `` It should be the most efficient, reliable, convenient public service in the country,'' he said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he senses even among advocates of privatization a desire to effect only gradual changes. `` I sense a desire to go slowly, a recognition that the mail system, like <ORGANIZATION> Humpty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dumpty </ORGANIZATION>, once broken, could n't be put back together again,'' he said. He said that if privatization means eliminating the letter-mail monopoly, skimming off the profitable segments of the postal business or busting the postal unions, he opposes it. But the postmaster general said he was willing to explore the idea of privatization that would promote efficiency through more sharing of the workload with major mailers and more contracting of non-critical postal services.

 Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Thursday added his voice to that of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> in suggesting that presidential hopeful <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> tone down his negative campaigning. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s suggestions that the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator refrain from further attacks on <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` are helpful and are on course as far as I'm concerned.'' The party chief also said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to suspend campaigning made the remaining Democratic contests all the more decisive. `` The process is doing what it was designed to do: narrow the field and pull from the field the strongest possible contender,'' he told a news conference. Asked whether he thought <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> would have to quit if he does poorly in the April 19 primary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said he did not wish to `` prejudge the results.'' On the subject of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s attacks on his rivals, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said, `` I spoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keep the debate and the dialogue positive and not involved in any negative campaigning.'' `` For the most part, we've been quite successful in that regard. The admonitions that have been addressed to Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> by Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in a positive way.'' On whether <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> himself might become the nominee in a brokered convention, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> insisted the Democratic nominee would be chosen from among the candidates now running. `` There is a game going on on the field. That's where the nominee's going to be chosen from,'' he said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have `` significant representation'' on the party's platform committee, regardless of who eventually becomes the nominee. He disputed a reporter's suggestion that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s influence might result in a more liberal platform than would otherwise be produced. `` The fact that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is running and doing well is an important constructive force within the Democratic party and should not be looked upon as an overwhelming problem,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. At the same time, he appeared to temper slightly his earlier assertion that the party's 1988 platform be kept sparse and bland, saying the party would not `` sound a retreat from'' issues it had championed in the past, including the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> and abortion rights. Asked specifically about abortion, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said, `` I think our party has always embraced the rights of privacy, the rights of individual choice.'' However, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> suggested that the platform would address these issues in a way that would not be divisive and which would give <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates a document `` to run with and not shy away from.'' Although <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s suggestion last December that the party platform be kept vague won the support of other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, it was criticized by a variety of interest organizations. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, chairman of the platform committee, said that state and regional hearings will be held on the platform in the coming months. However, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said he would not permit the platform hearings to turn into an ideological battleground. `` I'd like to think that someone will read it other than opponents. I hate to work on something that will collect dust,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>New Booklet Shows Declining Rural Population in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population keeps growing, but its rural population has shrunk dramatically since the early 1980s, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed Thursday. In 1982, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reported a population of more than 1.01 billion, a record 803.9 million, or 79 percent, lived in rural areas. By 1985 the total population was more than 1.04 billion, but rural residents were down to 662.9 million people, or 63 percent. Population figures and many others are included in a new edition of a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> publication: `` Agricultural Statistics of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, 1949-86,'' by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> and others of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> The new version expands greatly an earlier statistical report on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s agriculture issued in 1984, which was the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s first since the communists took charge in 1949. Although not likely to make this spring's best-seller lists, the 158-page report is expected to be in great demand from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> watchers and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural traders interested in that potentially huge Asian market. The first edition in 1984 was 71 pages long. The report relies on `` the important, although still incomplete, agricultural data that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported during 1949-85, with some updates through 1986,'' the authors said. Some 126 national and provincial tables of figures are included, along with an introduction, explanatory notes, references and suggested readings. Various sections include agricultural production; `` inputs'' such as farm machinery, fertilizer and labor; exports and imports; and consumption and procurement. The provincial tables include <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population by region and province; agricultural areas by crops; hog slaughter; horse and camel year-end inventory; milk production for cows and goats; and consumption by peasants. Officials said the report may be ordered from: Superintendent of Documents, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20402, or telephone -LRB- 202 -RRB- 783-3238.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday spurned a Vietnamese official's invitation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to send food aid to regions where villagers are being asked to search for the remains of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen. `` We are outraged at any suggestion of linking food assistance with the return of remains,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` As you know, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not provide aid to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and does not plan to do so.'' The spokeswoman said there was no official Vietnamese request for food aid and that her response was based on news reports of comments in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> after a visit by Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S. <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is exploring the possibility of assisting <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Food For Peace program. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> was quoted as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might consider offering food to areas of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> where rural people are asked to find <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen's remains. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has ruled out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government assistance to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as well as formal diplomatic relations, as long as Vietnamese troops remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The administration has also accused <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> of withholding information that could resolve what happened to at least some of the 1,700 American servicemen still listed as missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. During an airport ceremony in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Wednesday, 27 bodies thought to be of missing Americans were loaded aboard a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport aircraft for a flight to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> where identification experts will try to identify the remains. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> welcomed the Vietnamese decision to turn over the remains, but she declined to judge whether <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s action satisfied <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s promise last year to do as much as possible to resolve the cases of missing servicemen. The agreement was reached during a mission by retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> promised to encourage private American organizations to provide relief services to Vietnamese war victims. The chief effort involves the supply of prosthetic devices to Vietnamese who lost limbs during the war.

<TEXT>
 Scientists have confirmed the presence of an abnormal protein in normal-looking brain cells in Alzheimer's disease patients, adding evidence that it may be an early contributor to the disease Further study may lead to a way of battling the memory-decaying condition before its effects are irreversible, they said Thursday. `` You can imagine how exciting it would be if we had a way of intervening before there has been much irreversible damage,'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON>, head of the neurology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. There is no known treatment or cure for Alzheimer's disease, which the scientist said affects nearly 3 million Americans and is the single most common cause of mental decline in older people. The results of <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON>'s study, done in collaboration with <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoesen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> and brain chemists at the <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were to be published Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Annals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurology </ORGANIZATION>, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Alzheimer's is centered in cells which transmit signals to and from the memory center in the brain, <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON> said. He compared the disease's action to a computer with faulty input and output lines. That limits the functioning of the computer `` while not doing too much damage to the computer itself,'' <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON> said. The study, done by autopsies on the brains of Alzheimer's patients, shows that the disease is very specific in the brain cells it attacks, <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON> said The protein confirmed by the study was previously idenfified and named A68, by Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> at <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>. `` It looks like the disease knows its way and is very choosey,'' he said.

<HEAD>Amid Missile Attacks, Iran Ready For Parliamentary Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under the threat of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles and air raids, Iranians vote Friday for a new parliament that will be a key factor in determining the course of the Islamic revolution. The election of a new 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, will be vital in determining who will hold power in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dies. He is 87 and reported in poor health. The vote is seen as a test of strength between fundamentalists who support an Islamic-style capitalism and radicals who favor a socialist-style economy. Iranian leaders fear that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will blitz <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other major cities with a barrage of missiles to disrupt the elections, and they have urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s more than 20 million voters to turn out in a massive show of defiance. `` The people will attend the election with God's help, even if they are under missile attack. I will vote under any circumstances,'' <PERSON> Khomeni </PERSON> said last week. He added, `` The people must beware and choose candidates among ... those loyal to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. They must choose their deputies from among those who have suffered from poverty and are real Moslems, not those who obey <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Islam.'' About 1,400 candidates, approved by provincial and city governors controlled by Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, will be running. Tha's about 400 more than ran in the last election in 1984. There will be 30 female candidates. It's the first time women have run for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament. It is the third parliamentary poll since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. Iranian leaders have said the election will be a crucial test for the Islamic form of democracy, and the campaigning has shown sharp differences between rival factions over the future course of domestic policy. The 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war, the country's most pressing problem, has not figured in the campaigning <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s undisputed patriarch, has decreed that the war will not end until his adversary, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, has been toppled The conservatives essentially identify with the religious fundamentalists, who base their concept on a narrow interpretation of the teachings of the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, which protects private property and free enterprise. Their protagonists, seeking tighter state control, are likely to garner widespread support from the increasingly discontented poor who have to cope with runaway inflation and a flourishing black market. Cigarettes cost $ 10 a pack, red meat is about $ 16 a pound, and eggs are $ 8.50 a dozen. House Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s closest aides and considered a pragmatist on most issues, is expected to be reelected along with most of the leading figures in the hierachy. But the hardliners, such as Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, are expected to make some gains, a development that could have far-reaching effects on the shape of the revolution in the post-Khomeini era. None of the candidates is running on party tickets. The last formal party, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s clerics used to gain power in the early days of the revolution, was disbanded by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> last June because it was torn by factionalism. The candidates will represent various shades of Islamic and revolutionary thinking. The results may not be known for 10 days, and the new parliament may not sit until June while a new cabinet is screened and nominees scrutinized by the deputies.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday published its list of candidates for the April 24 presidential elections: one woman and eight men including President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> who leads all public opinion polls. The nine candidates each fulfilled the requirement of obtaining the signatures of at least 500 elected officials and payment of a $ 1,750 fee. French elections are run in two rounds. If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the April 24 first round, as expected, a run-off will be held on May 8. There is little doubt that the 71-year-old <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, seeking a second seven-year term, will win the largest number of first-round votes. Polls show him with about 38 percent. The real race is for the second runoff spot, a battle between conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and former center-right premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>. Polls indicate that <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would easily defeat either <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, 55, or <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, 63, in the second round. Many voters say, however, that they are undecided. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who trailed <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> in the early stages of the campaign, since has overtaken him and now is shown in the polls winning about 24 percent of the vote and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> about 15 percent. Farther back is <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, leader of the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, with about 10 percent, depending on the poll. Others in the race are <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>, 58, official candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, at about 6 percent, and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON>, 58, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Poliburo member now leading a splinter reform movement, who has about 3 percent in the polls. Also on the list are the ecologist candidate, <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waechter </PERSON>, 39, with about 2 -LCB- percent, <PERSON> Arlette </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguiller </PERSON>, 48, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Trotskyist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> movement, 1 percent, and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussel </PERSON>, 67, leader of the new extreme left <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, who has n't turned up in any polls. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was elected May 10, 1981, defeating incumbent President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s popularity, which fell to as low as 27 percent at midterm, has soared in the two years since he no longer has had direct control over the government. The two leading conservatives, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, have agreed not to attack one another so as not to split the right, and to support the top conservative vote-getter in the second round. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who has abandoned most of his Socialist rhetoric and taken pains to distance himself from the party he founded and led for many years, has moved toward the center. That has turned the campaign debate largely into a contest of personalities.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sent a letter to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, expressing concern about the continuing conflict in the war-torn country, an administration source said Thursday.

 A sixth-grader has done in a few months what critics say state leaders have been unable to do for years: solve <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s financial problems. <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did it as a school social studies project. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>, who became concerned last fall when he heard news stories about the state's growing financial woes, said his solution involves changing the `` gross state product'' by increasing the percentage of workers employed in industry. His project won the <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> and is entered in the May 20 state contest. <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> was last year's state fair winner. `` <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is in a desperate time, and it will take patience and tough decisions to bring the state back to prosperous times,'' the 11-year-old said. He suggests building hydroelectric dams, training workers in high-technology fields and lowering the costs of natural resources for in-state users. By 1990, <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> said, the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wo n't have enough electric power, and hydroelectric plants on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s rivers easily could generate power and help the state <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> also needs technically literate workers to attract industries to the state, he said. Included in Fife's research, along with newspaper accounts of the state's indebtedness and legislative performance, are responses from area legislators and an interview with state Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>. `` Sometimes I wonder if we should n't turn the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> over to the sixth-graders of the state,'' said <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr </PERSON>. The younger <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>, however, has no intention of becoming a legislator. He says he prefers collecting baseball cards, playing baseball and taking piano lessons.

 Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, author of the amendments which barred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, is retiring after 36 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've decided to call it a day,'' the 76-year-old Democrat said Thursday at a news conference attended by several dozen of the kids from his sand-lot baseball league _ now retired judges, mayors, district attorneys, and city and county officials _ who helped launch his political career 54 years ago. `` The parades are all over. The give-and-take of the campaign trail no longer beckons and the time has come when the bell tolls on a career that has been for me an exhilarating and fulfilling experience,'' said <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>. He had never lost an election since gaining the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> at age 22. <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1977 to 1985. He was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose hearings produced `` some of the longest days and in some ways some of the most unpleasant of my life.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's frustration with the Boland Amendments inspired the diversion of profits from arms sales to support the Contras. That operation became a focus of the Iran-Contra investigation and the recent indictment of former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the man who would later become the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, in 1952. For more than 20 years, the two friends roomed together in an arrangement they described as a real-life `` Odd Couple'' with <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, the neat and tidy half of the pair. <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> did not endorse a potential successor. <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, former Mayor <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimauro </PERSON>, state Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemanski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> and state Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetmore </PERSON> of <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> have all indicated an interest in the Democratic nomination.

<HEAD>US Soybean Producers Facing Heavy Competition From Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 World demand for high-protein, oil-rich soybeans has led other producing countries into a fierce competition with American farmers, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Thursday. Soybeans have the potential to supplement diets of low-income people in the Third World, where it will be important to gain consumer acceptance for soybeans and soy-fortified foods, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON>, an agriculture and trade analyst in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` A historical view shows that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dominance of world soybean trade, founded on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research and development in the 1940s and 1950s, declined in the 1980s as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, spurred by high prices, developed large-scale production and processing facilities,'' he said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> have been the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitors in the international soybean market. <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> added: `` Their success, mainly in temperate areas, has not been duplicated in tropical areas elsewhere in the Third World.'' The major factors behind the increased demand for soybeans in the Third World are rising incomes and population growth, <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said. As families have more to spend, their demand increases for meat and other food products such as margarine and cooking oil. `` Fierce export competition with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> for these markets, as well as the developed country market, will likely continue,'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said. `` The expansion of large-scale soybean production in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will continue as long as soybean prices are high enough for Brazilian farmers to profitably open new lands for soybeans.'' Further encouragement would be in the Brazilian government's willingness to develop the rural transportation system connecting the new lands to ocean ports, he said `` If the price of soybeans is high relative to other crops, farmers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and elsewhere will find it profitable to switch even more of their existing cropland to soybeans,'' <PERSON> Vocke </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is pursuing delegates to the Republican National Convention even though he has given up a serious contest for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has decided not to campaign in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, dismissed his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection this week and has scaled back his public appearances, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` We did not mean to set off any alarm bells by this,'' she said. She later said, `` We are going to the convention whether we add delegates or not.'' The Secret Service agents are no longer needed because `` we are traveling about two to three days a week instead of the seven days a week we were prior to Super Tuesday,'' she said. Since his poor showing in the March 8 primaries, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has cut his staff from 200 to about 50, reduced his campaigning to those states that choose delegates by caucus rather than primary, and turned his attention from 1988 to 1992. Ms. <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had two rallies scheduled in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Thursday night and Friday and would fly to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on Saturday for campaign stops over the weekend. She said he would also make campaign appearances in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` We are absolutely in this through the convention,'' she said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has estimated he will go to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention in August with 150 delegates. So far, he has 17. Since his campaign was derailed during the early March primaries, when he failed to win any state including his native <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has shifted his emphasis from an attempt to broaden his base of support beyond the religious right to targeting delegates chosen by caucus. With those delegates, he said he will be able to bring a `` strong conservative message'' to the convention. That message would include the adoption of a national platform that supports prayer in school, the strengthening of the American family, and opposition to abortion.

<HEAD>Test Fails To Determine Whether Rape Occurred, Governor Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Genetic tests have failed to determine whether <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> committed a rape that his accuser now maintains never happened, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Thursday. The test, conducted on semen on underwear belonging to <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, may mark the end of attempts to prove whether <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> actually committed rape in 1977, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` At some point, the integrity of the judicial system demands that the proceedings come to an end, and this may be the end,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, 30, now being held for parole violation, had served six years of a 25 - to 50-year prison term when <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> commuted the sentence in 1985 following Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s recantation to time served <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he was not convinced that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was innocent, and <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorney requested that the DNA test be conducted on a pair of semen-stained underwear Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was wearing when she was assaulted. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Thursday that tests at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> failed to shed new light on the case. Dr. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON>, who conducted the tests, said semen that stained a pair of underwear worn by <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> `` was too degraded for analysis'' to determine whether it was <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON> said another type of test might be effective, but <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he was not sure of the credibility of that test and suggested that he was ready to close the books on the case. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, declined to comment on the governor's statements. The test used by <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON> analyzes genetic material unique to each person. In the <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> case, he sought to compare DNA from the semen on the underwear to genetic material in a sample provided by <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON> said he believed the DNA samples recovered from the panties had degenerated largely because the evidence was stored at room temperature from 1977 to 1985. He noted that the DNA test became available only recently. During televised hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, now of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, recanted her earlier testimony that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> had raped her. He is being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on a parole violation after being arrested Dec. 26 and accused of shoving a cook and stabbing her in the hand during a quarrel in a bar. In February, the state <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ordered <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> imprisoned until Aug. 16, when he could be paroled if he undergoes alcoholism treatment and complies with other conditions set by the board. Under the good-behavior terms of the commutation, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> also could be forced to serve out the sentence imposed in the rape case.

<HEAD>Protest Over Alleged Racism Ends Peacefully</HEAD>

 Eighteen black students were cited for trespassing and released after an all-day sit-in to protest alleged racism at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>. The peaceful protest by about 50 members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> ended Wednesday when campus police cited 18 students who refused to leave the campus housing office at the close of the work day. `` This protest is the culmination of a lot of different things that have gone unresolved at the university,'' said ASA President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>. The protest focused on charges by freshman <PERSON> Traci </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who claims she's been harassed by three white male dorm-mates who allegedly damaged her bicycle. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> also said she had suffered a year of racial slurs and jokes. `` They say things like, ` Only 27 percent of you pass anyway, why study?''' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said, referring to a 1987 study which indicated that 27 percent of black students at the university graduate. The protesters demanded the three men be expelled and that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> be refunded her housing expenses for the school year. University spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvig </PERSON> said the white students will be disciplined. `` The Office of Student Conduct did a rapid and thorough investigation and has drawn up a proposed settlement,'' he said. The agreement involves payment by the men for the damage to the bicycle, moving the students to other dorms and requiring them to perform some community service. `` I do n't know about anything else, all I did was hang her bike in the shower because she's my friend,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, identified as one of the students. He called the incident a practical joke. Freshman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisher </PERSON>, also named by the <ORGANIZATION> ASA </ORGANIZATION>, admitted he hung <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' bike in the shower a second time. `` But it was only the bike, it has nothing to do with racism,'' he said.

<HEAD>FCC Dismisses Five Indecency Complaints Against Broadcasters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday dismissed five indecency complaints, including one against a television station that aired a sex-education program for teen-agers and another against a radio station that apparantly aired a reading of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>'s `` Ulysses.'' In four of the cases, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the material involved did not violate the agency's decency standards. It said thre fifth case did not contain sufficient information to determine the context of the material aired. A complaint filed against <ORGANIZATION> KING-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, cited a program called `` Teen Sex, What About the Kids?'' which included what the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> described as `` frank discussions of sexual topics, the use of sex organ models and the simulated demonstration of various birth control devices.'' In a letter to the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> couple who complained, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said that while the program contained references to sexual and excretory organs and activities, the references `` in context, were not ` vulgar,' ` lewd' or ` shocking.' Nor were they made in a pandering or titillating manner.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> judges material to be indecent if it `` depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory organs or activities.'' The agency also says it will examine the context of the material. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has said indecent material may be broadcast between midnight and 6 a.m. because there is little risk children would be in the audience then. Obscene material, however, can not be aired at any time. Such material is defined as appealing to the prurient interest and lacking serious artistic, literary, political or scientific value. Broadcasters are challenging the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old decency standards in court, charging the guidelines are vague. They say the commission has refused to identify specific material that would be deemed indecent under the standards. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has said broadcasters should be guided by the decisions the agency makes in the cases that come before it. A complaint against <ORGANIZATION> WBAI-FM </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pacifica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, described portions of an unidentified program that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said appeared to be a reading from the `` Penelope'' chapter of `` Ulysses.'' Assuming the program was a reading from the classic work, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said, `` we would not expect that the commission would find such -LRB- sexual and excretory -RRB- references, dispersed as they would have been throughout the three-hour reading of this work of literature, to be patently offensive.'' Another complaint the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> dismissed had been filed by the mayor of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, against WTMA-AM, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, for airing a political advertisement opposing his proposal to put a clock on the City Hall. Toward the end of the ad, someone shouts `` clocksucker.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also found the song `` I Want to Kiss Her, But ...,'' aired by <ORGANIZATION> WTRG-FM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was not indecent, despite its use of double entendre. `` The lyrics at issue here are not such that they are capable of only one, sexual meaning. Rather, the lyrics are capable of two meanings _ one innocent, one sexual,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. The commission ruled last April in a case involving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> disc jockey <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> that double entendre and innuendo could be deemed indecent when they were mingled with explicit references that made the material capable of only a sexually explicit meaning. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s series `` Heimat,'' about the life of three German families from the end of World War I to the 1960s, was the target of another complaint because of scenes containing sexual activity. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the complaint, filed against WCET-TV, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, did not contain sufficient information to determine the context of the material. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a WCET executive, said the series that aired on about 70 PBS stations last October and November contained some nudity, but he said it was relevant to the story line and the characters. `` Without those scenes a large part of the content would not have made sense,'' he said.

 The world changed for the Marukis when they left their small plot of land near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> three days after it was destroyed by an atomic bomb. For millions born after 1945, the devastation of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> is history. For <ORGANIZATION> Iri </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Toshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruki </PERSON>, it was a revelation that led to the creation of murals depcting the horrors of war. The two are subjects of the film `` Hellfire: A Journey from <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>,'' produced by filmmaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Junkerman </PERSON> and nominated for a 1988 Academy Award as best documentary feature. <PERSON> Maruki </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> 86 years ago, and his wife, 76, went to <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> on Aug. 9, 1945, the same day an atomic bomb was dropped on <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, to check on family members. He had lost his father, uncle, two nieces and numerous friends in the inferno, which killed an estimated 130,000 people. Both say the death and destruction left by the bomb remains a living memory. `` How can we forget?'' <PERSON> Maruki </PERSON> said. `` The horror is always in our mind. The stench of death was in our nostrils for three or four weeks.'' He and Mrs. <PERSON> Maruki </PERSON> were interviewed Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, which is displaying some of their works _ powerful ink canvases including some of the `` <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> Panels,'' `` <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>,'' and `` The Battle of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>.'' The two are scheduled to receive honorary doctorates from the college. Titled `` Surviving Visions,'' it is the first <PERSON> Maruki </PERSON> exhibition in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1970. The artists, who spent a month in the devastated city, describe this work as `` a procession of ghosts, with hands held before them ... -LRB- who -RRB- pushed on, dragging their burned bodies, falling and piling into one another, groaning and dying. `` One lone child slept innocently, with unburned skin,'' they write in a an exhibit catalog. `` Perhaps it survived, sheltered by its mother's breast.'' One of the `` <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> Panels,'' `` Ghosts,'' completed in 1950, depicts some of the dead and dying, naked, their bodies charred, their faces anguished. `` Death of American Prisoners of War'' is a 1971 canvas depicting a tragedy that was taboo in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for decades, the massacre of 23 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> POWs by enraged survivors of the bombing. `` We trembled as we painted the death of the American prisoners of war,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Maruki </PERSON> wrote. The victims' manacled corpses are intertwined with erotic nude figures of their wives and lovers back home. A dark, menacing mass of enraged Japanese crowds the periphery of the drawings. `` Auschwitz'' resulted from a trip to the former death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 3 million Jews and other inmates were gassed or starved to death by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Completed in 1977, the work's eight somber panels pay tribute to Holocaust victims and survivors. The <PERSON> Marukis </PERSON> said their art educates generations born too late to experience the horrors of World War II. `` The kids do n't know because they're not taught in school,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Maruki </PERSON>, suggesting that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> still was reluctant to come to grips with a painful period in its history. `` I suspect that the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> is somehow maneuvering not to teach -LRB- this -RRB- modern history to children.''

 Scientists have confirmed the presence of an abnormal protein in normal-looking brain cells in Alzheimer's disease patients, adding evidence that it may be an early contributor to the disease Further study may lead to a way of battling the memory-decaying condition before its effects are irreversible, they said Thursday. `` You can imagine how exciting it would be if we had a way of intervening before there has been much irreversible damage,'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON>, head of the neurology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. There is no known treatment or cure for Alzheimer's disease, which the scientist said affects nearly 3 million Americans and is the single most common cause of mental decline in older people. The results of <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON>'s study, done in collaboration with <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoesen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> and brain chemists at the <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were to be published Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Annals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurology </ORGANIZATION>, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Alzheimer's is centered in cells which transmit signals to and from the memory center in the brain, <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON> said. He compared the disease's action to a computer with faulty input and output lines. That limits the functioning of the computer `` while not doing too much damage to the computer itself,'' <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON> said. The study, done by autopsies on the brains of Alzheimer's patients, shows that the disease is very specific in the brain cells it attacks, <PERSON> Damasio </PERSON> said The protein confirmed by the study was previously idenfified and named A68, by Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> at <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>. `` It looks like the disease knows its way and is very choosey,'' he said.

<HEAD>States Try To Get EPA To Move on Acid Rain Reductions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nine states and four environmental groups renewed their attempt Thursday to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to order reductions in emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain. The states asked <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to publish for public comment two procedural findings made by the agency under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> just before he left office: That acid rain originating in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pollution endangers the environment in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; and that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> grants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the same rights to protest air pollution there that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has to protest air pollution here. The Canadian province of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> filed a similar petition of its own, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer representing the province. Those findings must be made before <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> could order the states to require reductions in the precursors of acid rain. Then-EPA Administrator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Costle </PERSON> announced those decisions in early 1981. In a case brought by eight of the states and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, a federal appeals court said the findings, to be valid as a starting point for further action, had to be published as draft agency regulations to give the public a chance to comment on them. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declined to intervene. In asking for quick action _ within 60 days _ on the grounds that the substance of the question had been decided for years, and indeed affirmed in statements by various officials including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the states said, `` These elementary decisions do not involve identification of sources or responsible states, or the prescription of emission reductions or other remedial actions.'' In the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has resisted doing anything about <PERSON> Costle </PERSON>'s letter on the grounds that not enough was known about acid rain to tell the states what to do, or even specify which states should be targeted. The administration has agreed with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to spend $ 2.5 billion, matched by industry, to speed the commercialization of cleaner methods of burning coal. In earlier proceedings, the plaintiffs said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should order emission reductions in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Acid rain results from the conversion of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels into sulfuric and nitric acids in the atmosphere. Though there are many contributors, sulfur dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants and factories is major source of the acid precursors. Many environmentalists blame acid rain for acidifying lakes and streams in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and in eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to the point that fish can not live. In a parallel case, many of the same states are trying to force <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to order other states upwind of them to require emissions reductions from sources within their borders to enable the downwind states to fulfill their own air pollution control plans. That case will be argued for the second time later this month before the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday's petitioners were <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Izaak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.

 Federal agencies involved in housing, hamstrung by a lack of congressional guidance, are doing little or nothing about the threat from cancer-causing radon, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Although environmental officials say radon causes up to 20,000 cancer deaths a year, the housing agencies see little responsibility to respond, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a report. The report scrutinized the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who requested and released the year-long <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study, called its results `` disturbing.'' `` While millions of Americans are at risk, federal bureaucrats ... sit on their hands,'' said <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental oversight subcommittee Radon is a naturally occurring, odorless and colorless gas. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says radon may cause from 5,000 to 20,000 lung-cancer deaths annually. A byproduct of decaying, underground uranium, radon rises from the ground and can seep into buildings. Trapped indoors, the gas poses health threats that can far surpass heavy smoking or inordinate exposure to X-rays. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was assigned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to lead the attack on radon. So far, it said, `` much work remains'' on <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s acceptable, but slow-moving strategy <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> to evaluate the radon response by federal agencies who administer housing or subsidize home ownership. Investigators found an overall lack of response, `` ranging from responding to a few site-specific problems to not being involved with indoor radon at all,'' the report said. Officials of the housing agencies are largely unaware of radon problems. and are uncertain whether they have any legal responsibility, it said. Courts appear unlikely to hold federal agencies liable in cases arising from radon, it added. The report said that while <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s radon mandate is clear, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has said nothing to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the VA or FmHA. In addition, it said, the agencies are further confused by the lack of an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> standard for how much radon is too much. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator should meet to `` define their respective responsibilities and planned actions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, could consider specifying how it wants other agencies to deal with radon. it said. The report's poorest grades went to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the home mortgage insurance program and subsidies for public and Indian housing. It said `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has reacted to radon hazards in a limited, piecemeal manner.'' Department spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Glavin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has no overall radon policy, but has reacted to specific cases of suspected pollution. The VA, which administers a guaranteed and insured loan program for veterans buying homes, has `` no radon policy and essentially is not involved with the issue,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. VA spokesman <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said the agency, in backing mortgage loans, generally defers to state law on housing construction and safety standards. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s highest grades went to the FmHA, which lends mortgage money in rural areas. According to the report, <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> has trained its field workers in radon measurement and mitigation, and is at work on an overall policy. <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ence </PERSON> said, `` We've been on top of this for several years.'' Only the Park Serice, which operates housing for visitors and staff, has pursued comprehensive radon testing at those dwellings and its administrative buildings, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found.

 A meltdown at the <ORGANIZATION> Tarrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> left <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s World On Ice in puddles and hundreds of tiny <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> and Snow White fans out in the cold. After a Tuesday opening that attracted more than 6,000 fans, convention center officials had to cancel two performances Wednesday when a blown fuse allowed the 80 - by 200-foot rink to melt Disney characters _ including <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>, Happy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Dopey and Bashful _ got an unscheduled day off. `` It's unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, executive director of the convention center. `` This has never happened to us before _ or to them.'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ericson </PERSON>, regional marketing director for the show, estimated ticket sale losses `` anywhere from $ 40,000 to $ 200,000. I think there may be some kind of insurance covering this, but I'm not positive. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said convention center workers first noticed the blown fuse had jammed a pump that is part of the ice-making refrigeration system late Tuesday. But they did n't think the problem was serious. By Wednesday morning, most of the rink had turned to slush. A mechanical firm fixed the pump and fuse Wednesday afternoon, but it took seven hours to freeze the half-inch of ice required for the show. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ericson </PERSON> said tickets for the canceled shows would be honored at any of the remaining performances in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and shows next week in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, or they can be turned in for a refund.

 Jurors acquitted 13 white supremacists Thursday of charges including conspiring to overthrow the federal government and to kill a federal judge and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. The all-white jury returned the verdict in its fourth day of deliberations, a day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> refused to accept the panel's statement that it was deadlocked on two of the counts. The defendants included three leaders of white supremacist groups: <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Asked how the seven-week trial affected the white supremacist movement, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said, `` Who knows? What movement? What's left of it after this?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> said he thought the government had proved its case but `` we accept the verdict of the jury.'' Nine defendants were charged with seditious conspiracy, accused of wanting to overthrow the government and start an all-white nation in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Five were accused of conspiring to kill the federal officials, and two also were charged with transporting stolen money across state lines. Six of the defendants are already serving prison terms for other crimes. The jury reached a verdict Wednesday on the charge involving the judge and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, but <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> ordered it sealed until deliberations were complete. The government said supremacist groups robbed banks and armored trucks of $ 4.1 million, including about $ 1 million that still is missing. The defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, who led a supremacist group in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and now is serving 20 years for racketeering. `` The government was going to send a message to the movement. The movement sent a message to the government. The message was the same one God told pharoah, ` Let my people go,''' said <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, the national chaplain of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON>, who hugged several of the defendants after the verdict was announced. <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> said it was not a political trial. `` We were n't after them for what they believed or what they said, but what they did,'' he said. He declined to say whether any investigations of a similar nature are under way and said he did not know the cost of the trial. <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> celebrated his acquittal by going to a Confederate memorial opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he called the `` Zionist occupation government.'' `` There are over 150 other political prisoners being held in <ORGANIZATION> ZOG </ORGANIZATION>'s jails that need to be freed,'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said. `` I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today. I think everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was simply being punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of ZOG.'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON>, fainted and was carried a block to an attorney's office by her husband. Maximum penalties for conviction would have included 20 years and a $ 20,000 fine for seditious conspiracy, life for conspiracy to murder, and 10 years and a $ 10,000 fine for transporting stolen money. The trial started Feb. 16. In addition to <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, the defendants included: <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scutari </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, already serving 60 years after being convicted of racketeering in a trial in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Metalline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, serving 100 years from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for racketeering and 150 years after being convicted in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> of violating the civil rights of radio personality <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> by murdering him. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnhill </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, serving 40 years for racketeering. <PERSON> Ardie </PERSON> <PERSON> McBrearty </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Gentry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, serving 40 years for racketeering. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, serving 40 years for racketeering and 150 years for <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, 57, of <PERSON> Muse </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, sentenced to die for the murder of a pawn shop operator in 1983 and life in prison without parole for the 1984 slaying of an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> state trooper. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION>, Ark <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION>, father of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top aides voiced concern Thursday about the safety of deposed Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and stressed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes him as the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country's rightful leader. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to maintain contact with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in the wake of the arrest warrant issued against him in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, as far as the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is concerned, is the lawful president of that country,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters, `` and we'll be greatly concerned if General -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were to attack the vested authority of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and we will watch that very carefully.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, staying at an oceanside hotel not far from the mountaintop ranch where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is vacationing, said they were still checking out some aspects of the move by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to have <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> arrested. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been in hiding since Feb. 26, when he was toppled from power following a failed attempt to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as chief of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who were traveling to <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cielo </PERSON> later Thursday to brief <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and other issues, said they put no stock in reports that <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, frustrated over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s continued grip on power, was considering giving up his quest to reassume power. `` I've had no indication of that,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. And <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, `` No, in fact his representatives have said that is not the case. He is still very much the president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. We recognize him as such. We know of no plans on his part.'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mariela </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, had said Wednesday that her husband received assurances from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of new steps to dislodge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Asked about that Thursday, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> replied, `` I'm not going to describe what options we may have under consideration or what our conversations have been with President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said `` we're fully prepared to deal with'' contingencies, but he did not elaborate. Asked whether he thought <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was in an increasingly perilous position because of the warrant, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe that is the case, but of course we are in touch with him and we are concerned about his security and we will be in touch with him, make sure he is satisfied with his security. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also said `` we have channels open'' to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but said that `` I'm not going into any detail as to what those channels are or what might be passing -LRB- through them -RRB-.'' Panamanian government prosecutor <PERSON> Alvoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Visuetti </PERSON> announced on television Wednesday night that arrest warrants had been issued against <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>; <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galino </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who remains in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capital The warrant against <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> accuses the deposed president of crimes against the state and the nation's economic security. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny Thursday a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> saying that an interagency task force has recommended that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -LRB- IEEPA -RRB- to stop payments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses and individuals to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or any of its governmental agencies. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, in response to questions, said he did not rule out the possibility that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would invoke the seldom-used law authorizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to seize tax payments and other monies. `` I said we had IEEPA under consideration and we had not made a decision on that.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has slapped a variety of economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> already, including the freezing of its assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the withholding of payments to the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But administration officials have been showing growing impatience with the fact <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains despite the economic, political and military pressure brought against him.

 Sandinista and Contra military delegations on Thursday discussed technical details of providing humanitarian aid to the rebels and controlling zones where the insurgents are to gather during a cease-fire. A spokeswoman for the Contra umbrella organization, the Nicaraguan Resistance, said Thursday the rebels were refusing to discuss giving up their arms. The talks were at the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, where the two sides reached a cease-fire accord on March 23. That agreement requires them to reach a permanent truce to end the nearly 7-year-old war that the leftist government says has claimed more than 26,000 lives. The two delegations decided Wednesday on the number and location of the zones where the rebels will gather during the 60-day cease-fire. It went into effect last Friday, although all the details were not worked out. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> warned Wednesday that the Sandinistas would launch an offensive against the Contras if they fail to comply with the March 23 accord. Under that agreement, the rebels said they would gather in the cease-fire zones while their leaders negotiated a more permanent truce. In exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have pledged to carry out democratic reforms. But the Sapoa talks have been marked by mutual distrust and differing interpretations of the vaguely worded plan. Still unresolved were pledges of security for the Contras inside the cease-fire zones, how they would receive food and other supplies, who would control the areas and how compliance would be verified. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, said the rebels at the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> talks were refusing to discuss the delicate issue of the Contras laying down their weapons. The March 23 accord does not mention disarming, something the Contras vow they will never do, Ms. <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas claim that surrendering of weapons is implicit in the agreement and essential for peace. Meanwhile, pro-government newspapers Thursday described as `` false'' a document circulating in the capital said to be from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The document, marked `` secret,'' appears to have been written earlier this year and outlines party strategy. According to the document, Sandinista troops should stage an offensive along the Honduran border to rid the area of Contras and their supply bases. Such an offensive, it argues, would oblige <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to accept the presence of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops in the border area. `` The incursions by our troops into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in pursuit of the mercenaries will surely provoke imperialist reactions, which we have to watch but not fear,'' the document said. The <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> did carry out an offensive against the Contras in the northern border area in March. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> charged that Sandinista forces had entered his country's territory while chasing the rebels. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded by sending 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for two weeks of exercises. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> denied his troops had entered the neighboring country. The document also noted <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s opposition to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies towards <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It called <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the head of a `` parallel power that has enabled us to tie the hands of the -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Thursday his government sent a letter of protest to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> denouncing a reported offer by <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to allow Contra supplies from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to arrive there. Speaking in a radio interview, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> made itself an `` instrument of American policies'' by acting as an `` illegal springboard for supplies for the mercenary forces.''

 White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Thursday defended the propriety of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secret leasing arrangement for a $ 2.5 million estate and said the first family `` may not like'' all the publicity about the deal The White House refuses to say how much <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, are paying for the three-bedroom, six bath home in the exclusive Bel Air section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that has a heated swimming pool and three-car garage. Real estate sources estimate the monthly rent at $ 12,000 to $ 15,000, based on fair-market value. Moreover, it is unclear why the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> are leasing the home instead of buying it outright. Also unknown are the identities of the 18-20 people who formed a consortium specifically to buy it for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>. The Reagans are planning to move into the home, at 668 St. Cloud Road, after he leaves office next Jan. 20. The 1 \ - acre property, in the poshest area of Bel Air, touches the <PERSON> Kirkeby </PERSON> estate where the `` Beverly Hillbillies'' television series was filmed and is located near the homes of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> and other celebrities, as well as some of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rejected the notion that there was any impropriety in the deal. Responding to reporters' questions at the seaside hotel where he is staying during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vacation, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the president and the first lady went to great lengths to make sure that this was an arms-length transaction, that there was a full appraisal of the rental price of this property and that all of the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` The president and the first lady have handled this in precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate criticism of the transaction.'' Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were upset by publicity about the house, he said, `` Oh, I do n't think so. I think after eight years they've come to understand that that occurs, and while they understand it, they may not like it, but they are not angry about it. A White House statement released Wednesday said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' three-year lease took effect March 1, and contained an option to renew or purchase No purchase price was specified in the lease, the White House said. Before buying the property, the prospective owners sought an opinion from the Office of Government Ethics on the propriety of leasing or selling the property to the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>. The opinion said the Reagans would comply with standards of conduct regulations and conflict-of-interest statutes if they paid a fair-market rental or purchase price for the house, the White House said. It said the lease terms were negotiated by representatives of the owners and the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, based on fair-market value rental estimates from two independent appraisers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics, confirmed that lawyers representing the consortium approached the agency in July 1986 and `` we did make an analysis of it'' and provide an informal opinion letter. Eighteen people were listed in the consortium, all but one described by the lawyers as friends of the Reagans for a number of years, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said. Presidents are not required to adhere to the standards or to federal conflict-of-interest criminal laws, but traditionally have committed themselves to doing so. The property was purchased in August 1986 by the consortium, which has incorporated itself as <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Realtor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> firm of <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that with rising prices since the purchase, the land alone now is worth $ 3 million `` They got a great buy,'' he said. `` The bought it for land value. As far as I'm concerned, they got the house for free.'' Realtor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaroe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the house, built in 1954, still has the original kitchen and bathrooms and needs updating and renovations.

 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> suspended his stalled presidential campaign Thursday but held onto his 170 delegates in hopes of influencing the choice of a nominee at the Democratic national convention in July. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> immediately blasted <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for keeping the delegates, saying many of them were rightfully his. `` In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knows what twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a news conference. `` There will be many encounters with fate before the contest is ultimately decided in a wide-open convention.'' In a quasi-withdrawal, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would no longer actively campaign for the nomination but said he technically would remain a candidate even though he conceded he has `` no illusions that the nomination will come my way.'' `` I want to have an impact on who the party nominates,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` I want to have an impact on the whole process there -LRB- at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention -RRB-, and on where we go.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s move was a less-than-honorable one, and that he ought to release his delegates. `` If one is not in the race one ought to indicate a form of honorable withdrawal at which time whoever got second place in that state will get those delegates. That's what Mr. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> did. It was the honorable and the fair thing to do,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> dropped out of the Democratic race last month. `` I would hope that in time Mr. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> likewise _ now that he has made the decision to leave the race _ will leave so honorably, and hide behind no technicalities to block those as my delegates which in fact belong to me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to nominally remain a candidate and retain his delegates means he holds onto 47 at-large delegates won in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary. Had he formally withdrawn from the race, those delegates would have gone automatically to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Asked whether his move could be seen as an effort to deprive <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of support, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, `` I am sure it is not perceived by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a stop-Jackson effort.'' He said he had spoken to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the other two remaining Democratic candidates _ <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ about his plans. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would keep a lock on the 170 delegates he has won and an aide said he hoped to perhaps attract a few more by the time the party's last primaries end on June 7. At that point, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, he will meet with the delegates and decide what to do next. `` I owe something to those delegates,'' he said. A total of 2,082 delegates is needed to nominate a candidate. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> showed early strength in the Democratic campaign, finishing a close second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s first-in-the-nation caucuses. But he dropped to third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and failed to rebound as the primary season wore on, except for a lone win in his home state. His bid bottomed out Tuesday in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where he finished last with just 5 percent of the vote. He blamed his campaign's precipitous decline on a failure to effectively communicate his message of traditional Democratic party values, and on a lack of money, but said he did not see his failure as a rejection of those values. `` I do belive we have to have a government that cares, and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people believe that, too _ that I know,'' he said to the cheers of supporters who packed a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing room where he made his announcement. `` I really believe the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are ready for a candidate who says let's put unemployed people to work, let's have quality schools for this nation,'' he said. But <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he still is concerned, as he said at the outset of his campaign a year ago, that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could `` become a clone'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by forgetting its past. `` We ca n't build the kind of nation we want if we simply pander to the wishes of the rich and powerful,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 59, stayed true to his liberal background during the campaign. With his trademark bow-tie and claim to the plain-spoken legacy of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, he said often that voters were `` ready for something other than the slick, packaged product.'' He proposed long-term health care for the elderly, a public works program for the unemployed and new education initiatives, and promised that as president he would balance the budget in three years. But critics questioned how he could reconcile promises to set up expensive new programs while also claiming to be a fiscal conservative who would balance the budget.

<TEXT>
 Attorneys for three of four defendants charged in the Iran-Contra case moved Thursday to dismiss the indictment on the ground that prosecution evidence is illegally based on their testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers representing former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> contended that some of the evidence prosecutors used to obtain the 23-count indictment last month came from testimony the three gave to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra committees. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> testified under grants of limited or `` use'' immunity from prosecution that prohibits independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from using their answers to congressional questioning as evidence against them. Even though <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> tried to insulate his staff and grand jurors from publicity surrounding the hearings, `` given the widespread dissemination of immunized testimony throughout our society, the broad use of immunized testimony has been inevitable, undeniable and so pervasive that the indictment must be dismissed as a matter of law,'' the defense lawyers said. They asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to hold a hearing to determine whether grand jurors, prosecutors and investigators on <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff relied on the immunized congressional testimony. `` Never in the history of this nation has the immunized testimony of putative defendants been broadcast live, on all major networks, to tens of millions of viewers and listeners,'' said the written request. The defense contended that use of that congressional testimony or information derived from it `` has been and will be used against them in many ways in this prosecution, in violation of their rights under the Fifth Amendment.'' North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> were charged with conspiring to divert proceeds of the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned American military aid to the rebels. Lawyers for <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who brokered the arms deals with <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and testified on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> without use immunity, charged in a separate motion that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> illegally ignored congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> that would vindicate their client. `` The independent counsel's decision to exalt prosecutorial convenience above General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s Fifth Amendment right to a fair and informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him and requires, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that the indictment be dismissed,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyers said in their brief. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to force the grand jury to consider <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s congressional testimony. Both men told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was acting as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agent, a point the defense says should have been made to the grand jury before he was indicted. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is expected to respond in court pleadings on Friday. The independent counsel must prove that he insulated his staff and grand jurors from the publicity surrounding the hearings. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday to explore the issues sketched out in the defense brief. Before the congressional hearings got under way last spring, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> rushed many witnesses through the grand jury and filed evidence he had obtained under court seal to prove it was obtained independently of the congressional testimony. Among other things, the defense asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to question individual grand jurors to determine if they learned of the immunized congressional testimony from friends, relatives or news reports. The hearing should also determine whether or not grand jurors were exposed to immunized testimony from witnesses who testified in the grand jury. The defense said it planned to challenge the legal authority of former federal judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> to represent <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office on the immunity issue. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> was retained by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> as an outside counsel so that prosecutors on the independent counsel's staff would remain insulated from the congressional testimony. Defense lawyers contended <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> lacks legal authority to represent the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government under the disputed independent counsel law or the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulation that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> received to counter constitutional challenges to the special prosecutor statute.

 Fighting raged for the third day in a showdown for dominance in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between Shiite Moslem militias allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Police said 39 people were killed and 96 wounded. Casualties for the three days stood at 51 dead and 130 wounded, according to police figures The battle is between Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s mainstream militia Amal, supported by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It continued despite repeated cease-fire appeals from the highest Shiite clerics. That may indicate <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> wants to crus <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s challenge to its role as the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where the Syrians have 25,000 troops. A police spokesman said Amal units with armored personnel carriers advanced about noon into the coastal town of <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>, a key <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> stronghold. By nightfall, <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> recaptured the village after `` ferocious house-to-house fighting,'' police reported. They said most of the day's casualties occurred in <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>, five miles south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> said its fighters had captured and disarmed several <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen. `` With the recapture of <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> has established undisputed control over the whole of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as well as the main coastal highway,'' which links the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> south to the rest of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the communique said. Trouble between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> began Feb. 17, when Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who commands <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce observers, was kidnapped near Tyre and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> rounded up dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members it accused of involvement. Shiite militants loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are believed to hold most of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who include nine Americans. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> had seized 11 towns and villages, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters remain entrenched in three hamlets in addition to <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> accused Amal of stopping a convoy of international and <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> vehicles that carried three wounded Hezbollahis from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for treatment in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` The assailants forced all <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> personnel out of the ambulances and then raked the vehicles with gunfire, killing the three wounded men on their stretchers,'' the statement said. Amal denied involvement in the attack, whichoccurred after nightfall near the village of <LOCATION> Aaqbiyeh </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Police confirmed the attack without reporting the politics of the assailants or victims. They said no <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> personnel were hurt. The attack by Amal on <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION> `` obviously aims at stripping <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of its main supply line,'' said the police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing regulations. The road to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been blocked at <LOCATION> Ghaziyeh </LOCATION> since Wednesday, when <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters overran an Amal checkpoint in the town. The spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s 40 fighters in the village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roumman </LOCATION> surrendered to Amal a few hours after <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> seized the adjacent town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> in a `` sweeping attack.'' <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, 18 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, is a mainly Shiite town of 50,000. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw six <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters, their hands up, emerging from a gutted house in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>'s old sector and surrendering to Amal militiamen. Fighting for <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> was fierce. The two sides traded rocket-propelled grenades and mortar rounds until <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s last stronghold at the town's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> school fell to Aamal attackers. The school, occupied by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> when the confrontation broke out Tuesday, was devastated with its walls peppered with shell holes, blown-out windows and fire-blackened wooden desks.

 A major rift appeared Thursday in the opposition to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is getting tough with critics in defiance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic squeeze and a buildup of American forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own anti-government movement. Their leaders argued that the economic sanctions are hurting <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s people more than they are damaging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the civilian government he controls. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, announced formation of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in a break with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of about 200 organizations that has led the 10-month-old effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. They told a news conference their movement also is backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition political party. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has supported the Civic Crusade in its effort to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as chief of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which include the military and police. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, which he denies. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said the new movement rejects any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence. `` For us, no recipe that comes from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been favorable to the Panamanians,'' he said. `` The people of the world know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, never are favorable to the interests of the people.'' He added: `` It is absolutely necessary for Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to abandon his post. For us, this is fundamental.'' Leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations, strikes and other protests of the Civic Crusade, while differing with some of its policies and generally favoring a harder line. Popular Action, for example, refused to join the Crusade, Authentic Panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to a proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the Roman Catholic church. Political parties linked most closely with the Civic Crusade are the Democratic Christians and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Molirena </PERSON>. Those two parties, the Crusade and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> all recognize deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the constitutional head of state. Popular Action and the Authentic Panamanian Party do not. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> orchestrated the ouster of <LOCATION> Delvalle </LOCATION> on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, brother of a former Popular Action presidential candidate, said the movement `` will center its fight on the original principles of the Civic Crusade.'' He and <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON> denied its creation amounted to a split with the Civic Crusade, but rejected a proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop.

<HEAD>Aliens Urged To Apply for Amnesty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday urged illegal aliens eligible for amnesty to take advantage of a citizenship offer that expires May 4. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` urges those who may be eligible to attain this privilege and benefit to do so promptly.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement noted that more than 1.25 million illegal aliens have come forward to seek legal status under the `` general amnesty'' clause of sweeping immigration legislation <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a little more than a year ago. Among the law's amnesty provisions are requirements that the applicant be free of a criminal record and have lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continously since before 1982. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement took no notice of a bill approved March 31 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that would extend the May 4 amnesty application deadline to Nov. 30. The spokesman said that among the more than 1 million aliens who have applied so far for citizenship are people comprising nearly every nationality. `` By their actions in this country over the past six years, they have demonstrated that they deserve the privilege of remaining here in a fully legal status, without having to live in an underground society and fearing discovery of their unlawful existence,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` But the time to apply for citizenship under this ` amnesty' provision will end on May 4, 1988,'' it said `` There may still be those who for one reason or another have not taken advantage of this onetime opportunity.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` calls on all Americans to do whatever is in their power to remind their neighbors, friends, co-workers and others, who may be living outside our immigration laws ... that the time is growing short for them to come forward and join us as recognized members of our nation and society.'' Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> figures show that besides the more than 1.25 million general amnesty applications, there have been roughly 300,000 applications for citizenship under a separate program for farmers and farm workers. Of the applications that have reached the decision stage, only 12,700 have been rejected and 782,000 have been approved. The remaining applications are in the clearance pipeline at INS.

 A special grand jury investigating political corruption indicted 16 <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> political figures Thursday, including two state senators, three former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> members, the county prosecutor and <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>'s mayor. Also indicted were two county commissioners, a current and former magistrate, one former and two current county school board members, and the former county and circuit clerks, a spokesman in the circuit clerk's office said. State Sen. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor, was indicted on a felony count of bribery for allegedly accepting money when he was a county commissioner as part of a scheme to sell the sheriff's job for $ 100,000. <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> was indicted separately from the other 15. All others were charged in a 10-count indictment with various violations of state election laws, as well as with a felony count of conspiracy. The indictment alleges that they `` associated together with <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and others to improperly affect and influence the free election system and the law enforcement system of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, also a Democrat, was indicted on two counts of bribery, one count of conspiracy and one count of filing false accounts _ all felonies _ and one count each of making political contributions exceeding the state limits and failing to report political expenditures, both misdemeanors. <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> and Fanning both were reported to be out of their offices late Thursday afternoon and were unavailable for comment. Also named as defendants are <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, county school board members <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, former Delegates <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> K.O </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON>, and <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Meter </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, County Commissioners <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumora </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohari </PERSON>, Magistrate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, former Circuit Clerk <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, former County Clerk <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapourales </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, a former school board member and former director of the county's anti-poverty agency.

<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> got a message from two <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> heavyweights on Thursday to tone down his criticism of presidential front-runners <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, while Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> put his campaign on hold but kept his delegates in pocket. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ignored the message, making fresh attacks as he campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, one of the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> critics, implied he might withhold his sought-after endorsement and said, `` Who cares what ... <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says?'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> that his negative campaigning `` was n't helping him'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ahead of that state's April 19 primary Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s appeal to the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator `` The admonitions that have been addressed to Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> by Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in a positive way,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, a sometime adviser to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, took exception to the governor's comments. `` Big chief, big blanket, sends up big signal _ like make nice and roll over,'' <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said, adding that he assumed <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was trying to help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who managed only a primary victory in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said he would suspend campaigning, but refused to release his 170 delegates in hopes of influencing the national convention. `` I want to have an impact on who the party nominates,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a Capitol Hill news conference. `` I want to have an impact on the whole process there -LRB- at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention -RRB-, and on where we go.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> added that he had `` no illusions that the nomination will come my way.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't appreciate <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s near-withdrawal. As the runnerup to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he stood to gain the lion's share of 47 at-large delegates if <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> quit cleanly. `` If one is not in the race one ought to indicate a form of honorable withdrawal at which time whoever got second place in that state will get those delegates,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, adding that the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> at-large delegates `` in fact belong to me.'' The remaining Democratic trio addressed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meeting </ORGANIZATION>, the Irish-American Forum and the Democracy Project as they sought support from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials. The state holds its primary on April 19 with 255 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, under attack for criticizing his rivals, charged the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign with fueling a `` stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'' movement. `` I fear that in other camps something else is going on behind the scenes,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told the Democratic meeting. `` Last week the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> director of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Forceia </PERSON>, was quoted publicly as saying, ` A vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.' ... In my opinion that kind of politics is insulting to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, insulting to me and insulting to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let me make one thing clear: A vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, and if the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign wants to start a stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> movement, I want no part of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said that earlier in the campaign it was the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who used similar tactics. `` In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said a vote for anybody but him was a vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` So if the shoe fits, wear it. He's worn the shoe before.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> skipped the state party meeting and stayed in the state capital to deal with a budget crisis. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> found time, however, for a lengthy news conference in which he refused to endorse any of the Democrats and implied he might stay mum until the primaries end in June. `` Every day this -LRB- an endorsement -RRB- means less because we're getting close to the primary Who cares what ... <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says?'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s endorsement would still be relevant, and indicated that he had spoken to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor Thursday morning. `` People in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and across this country care very deeply about what Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> thinks and what other governors think. As I said the other day, that is the decision that he has to make.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> weighed the possibility of meeting with Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to allay their fears about his Arab sympathies. `` Sometimes you ca n't beat your head against the wall. You have to walk away from the wall,'' said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, who is Jewish. On the Republican side, a spokesman for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign said he would continue to pursue delegates through the GOP convention even though he has given up a serious run for the nomination. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> let go his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection because `` we are traveling about two to three days a week instead of the seven-days-a-week we were prior to Super Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>, a campaign spokeswoman. But she added: `` We are absolutely in this through the convention.''

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gunmen who killed 28 peasants at an Easter festival also tracked down eight survivors and murdered them, a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station reported Thursday. Station RCN quoted national police sources as saying drug traffickers were responsible for the massacre of the 36 people last Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Mejor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Esquina </ORGANIZATION>, a village in the northwestern state of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>. It said the information was included in a police report to the defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>. The national police are part of the military. Drug traffickers attacked the village because it allowed a leftist guerrilla group to use it as headquarters for extorting money from ranchers in the area, <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> reported, quoting the national police. Narcotics dealers had bought many of the ranches and were among those from whom money was demanded, the radio said. The hooded gunmen opened fire on peasants as they danced at an Easter festival and shot others as they lay face down in a hut. Among the dead were two boys 10 and 14 years of age. At least 10 people were wounded.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign organizers in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> expressed concern Thursday over comments by some of the state's top Democrats that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can not win the presidency. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, all Democrats, recently said they do not believe <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, if nominated by their party at the national convention here in July, can win the election in November. `` Yes, it does concern me _ it concerns me that politicians of whatever race automatically discount the electability and the credibility of other political candidates,'' said <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mears </PERSON>, co-chairman of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s other co-chairman, state Sen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said party leaders had assured him that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Super Tuesday showing would be properly reflected in the allocation of at-large delegate slots to be filled in May.

<HEAD>Koch Fears He Won't Be A Delegate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Thursday he may not be a delegate to the Democratic National Convention because he favors <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> for president. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he would like to be an uncommitted delegate so he could work to draft <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who is not running for the nomination. However, he said, 15 percent of the voters in the April 19 primary must cast ballots for `` uncommitted'' to empower the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> committee to send uncommitted delegates _ such as <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION> _ to the convention. The mayor has balked at backing one of the candidates, even though his commitment would end after the first ballot. `` I'm not going to endorse before the convention because I still want <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>,'' he told reporters. `` I think it would be unfair for me to endorse someone other than <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> ... and then desert them at the convention.''

<HEAD>Dukakis' Comment Sounds A Lot Like Koch's Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telegram </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is using a line about charisma and competence that sounds a lot like one used a decade ago by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor running for the Democratic presidential campaign, has responded recently to comments that he is on the dull and boring side by saying that `` after eight years of charisma, maybe it's time for a little competence.'' The Telegram said Thursday that in 1977, when <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was running for mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he asked: `` After eight years of charisma and four years of the clubhouse, why not try competence?'' _ a reference to the terms of Mayors <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Beame </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> apparently is not disturbed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to attribute the quote, the newspaper said, and it quoted <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonberg </PERSON> as saying, `` We're not charging for the slogan'' and adding `` it does n't bother him the least. He's aware of it.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, agreed the quote was similar to the one used by <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> but he said there was no deliberate attempt to steal it. `` I think by any measure it was total happenstance,'' he said.

 Four variations of the winter's most prevalent flu type have been circulating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that could pose a tricky question for researchers trying to concoct next winter's flu vaccine, health officials said Thursday. The 1987-88 vaccine did not protect patients against the various viruses as well as it could have against the single virus expected to predominate, said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON>, a researcher with the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` There have been people coming down with influenza who did receive the vaccine,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON> said. Although the current flu season is winding down, some activity continues, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> reported `` widespread'' flu outbreaks last week _ covering areas including more than half the population. Eight other states, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, reported less severe `` regional'' outbreaks. Late last year, as the 1987-88 influenza season began, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> saw evidence of an apparent `` drift'' in the predominant flu type, which this past winter was the one researchers call Type A-H3N2, one of three major types of flu. The predominant A-H3N2 virus, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said at the time, was `` drifting'' away from the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> flu, the A-H3N2 strain the 1987-88 flu vaccine was designed to stop, and toward a somewhat different form. On Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said it had now identified four different variants of A-H3N2 flu virus circulating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent months; they are known as the <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> flu, the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> flu, the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> flu and the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> flu. `` Co-circulation of two or more closely related ... variants in a single season is not uncommon,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. But the four different viruses present something for <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> immunization experts to think about, Ms. <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON> said. Each year, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Immunization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommends which flu types the next winter's vaccine should protect against and which specific strains of those types should be targeted. The reports of the four different A-H3N2 strains circulating this past winter `` will be used in deciding which H3N2 antigen to use'' in next winter's vaccine, Ms. <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON> said. `` They'll take this information, along with information provided from other areas, and put that together and try to determine which strain is most likely to circulate next season,'' she said. A single flu vaccine can not protect optimally against four different flu viruses belonging to the same type, she said. Instead, vaccine experts will try to determine which virus to target and how much protection that vaccine might offer against closely related viruses. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommends flu vaccine particularly for older people and those who might be prone to severe complications from the flu. Type A-H3N2 flu has long been associated with `` excess mortality,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, and many states have reported outbreaks of flu-like illness this winter in nursing homes, where patients might be particularly vulnerable.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Thursday agreement is at hand on ending the Afghan civil war and urged that a formal accord be signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> can begin withdrawing its troops May 15. That would be two weeks before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> begin their summit in the Soviet capital. Agreement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would resolve an issue that has troubled relations for nearly a decade, prompting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain embargo and keeping Americans home from the 1980 Olympics in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> issued a joint statement after meeting in the Soviet Central Asian city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>. `` There is certain to be a signed agreement on political normalization,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying while he toured a collective farm near <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> after the meeting. `` I think both <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will come to agreement, and that we and the Americans will agree to be guarantors.'' The joint communique, distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and read during the nightly news program `` Vremya,'' omitted the usual criticism of positions taken by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> peace talks. This omission could indicate some behind-the-scenes compromise. President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords were ready for signing, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> indicated problems remained. `` There are very difficult decisions and the only good thing _ I think that is important _ is that the political will is obviously there to take them,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after the Soviet-Afghan statement ws isasued. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, said in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said it was the `` first step toward victory'' and a `` defeat for the Russians.'' He said the guerrillas `` will try to intensify'' the war. Draft documents in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> call for an end to outside aid for the rebels and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have pressed for `` symmetry,'' a simultaneous end of Soviet military aid to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, quoted by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s official news agency, said: `` According to unofficial reports, the two superpowers have agreed on the symmetry under which both would be able to provide continued assistance to their respective allies in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' No details of the alleged agreement were given. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, administration sources said the Soviet-Afghan agreement appears to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for ending aid to the warring parties and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was described by his chief of staff, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, as `` cautiously optimistic.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, addressing the issue of symmetry, said: `` We have not yet received a response from the Soviet government on our proposal. Until it's received, we must reserve judgment.'' Soviet officials claimed earlier this week that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s eastern neighbor, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were delaying a settlement. They threatened to make a separate withdrawal arrangement with the Afghan leadership if the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks failed. Moslem insurgents began fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a Communist coup in April 1978. Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 soldiers now are there to help fight the guerrillas. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is involved in the negotiations because about 3.5 million Afghan refugees live there. Most are in border towns and camps that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas, who are armed and trained by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, was asked at a news briefing whether there was a U.S.-Soviet compromise on Afghan aid. `` The situation is evolving,'' he said. He refused comment about <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s statement and would not answer questions about the Soviet-Afghan statement, saying only: `` Let's let the communique work for itself for a while. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared in the eight-point communique they `` believe that the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved in the settlement, and favor their immediate signing.'' They said withdrawal would begin May 15 if the peace package was signed `` within the shortest period.'' Their statement praised <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who has worked to produce a negotiated settlement of the Afghan war since the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks began four years ago. It also said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> `` welcomes the readiness of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' to guarantee adherence to the accords. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, capital of the Uzbek republic, on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not explain the purpose the trip for more than six hours, then said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also had flown there from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had spent four days working with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on a withdrawal plan to be implemented in case the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks failed.

 The Soviet-Afghan agreement under which the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> may start pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by May 15 appears to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions on continuing aid to the warring parties, administration sources said Thursday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was described by his chief of staff, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, as `` cautiously optimistic.'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still `` wants to see the fine print,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is vacationing. `` We think an agreement now is clearly within reach,'' said one administration source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who closely monitors Afghan developments. Administration officials interpreted a statement issued by <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his Afghan ally <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as `` an indication that they have agreed to our conditions, but we want to know that authoritatively,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of annoymity. The administration is waiting to hear from the Soviets on a proposal advanced by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on March 31. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ under what is being called a `` gentlemen's agreement'' _ would continue its estimated $ 600 million a year in covert aid to the Afghan guerrillas as long as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was aiding the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not budged from the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> formula, which embodies what diplomats call `` positive symmetry.'' She said the Soviets had rejected a proposal involving `` negative symmetry,'' in which the two sides would end aid shortly after an agreement was signed. `` Our position is clear,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` Such an agreement must be a comprehensive settlement that provides for the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet troops, an independent non-aligned <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, self-determination for the Afghan people and the return of the refugees in safety and honor.'' Two other administration sources involved with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the next step would be to seek agreement at the United Nations-brokered talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on formation of an interim Afghan government during the Soviet withdrawal. `` The parties are going to work very hard on the interim government,'' said one official. `` It is the next item on the agenda. But it is not clear whether it will be part of the agreement.'' The Gorbachev-Najib communique, issued after a surprise meeting between the two in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, said `` the last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been removed thanks to constructive cooperation of all who are involved in the settlement and favor their immediate signing.'' The declaration said the road was now clear for formation of a coalition government including all political forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, `` including those who are currently opposed to one another.'' Many of the guerrillas balked at <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s previous political overtures, which he has billed as `` national reconciliation.'' The administration has seesawed on the question of ending aid to resistance. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had been pushing for cessation of aid to the guerrillas within 60 days of an agreement. But last December, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would continue sending aid to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas until the last of the 115,000 Soviet soldiers left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, acting on a resolution introduced by Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a 77-0 vote to stick to his guns, and at the beginning of March, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made the tougher line a formal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> The Soviets rejected that, and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> proposed `` negative symmetry,'' or simultaneous cessation of aid, a softer line than advanced by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December. But the Soviets rejected that too, and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> proposed `` positive symmetry,'' which was closer to the positions taken by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last December and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in February. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> applauded the latest turn of events. `` Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has kept me informed of the developments during the last three weeks of negotiations. From our conversations, I believe that my concerns have been met. I want to give this agreement a chance,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said in a statement issued by his office. Another lawmaker who has vocally supported the guerrillas, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, was pessimistic about the chances of the proposed agreement. `` If the option to resupply is not in writing, then the government of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> -LRB- which channels aid to the guerrillas -RRB- is going to find itself in under tremendous domestic and international pressure to pinch or sever the arms pipeline,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> greatly increased its covert arms shipments to the guerrillas, but curtailed shipments of hand-held Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, according to congressional sources who closely track the issue.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest wanted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, should be tried in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the investigating judge said Thursday. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, however, that <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON> was expected to be extradited. <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON>, 46, is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and was arrested by Italian drug police Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION>. He was among 39 people charged in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> last week with participating in a large international heroin and smuggling ring with links to the Sicilian Mafia. <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON> was arrested at the home of an art restorer identified by police as <PERSON> Adria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gialdini </PERSON>. She and her husband, <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santunione </PERSON>, were arrested on charges of aiding and abetting the fugitive and possession of firearms. In announcing <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON>'s arrest Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` The Italian government will turn him over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, probably federal marshals, tomorrow.'' The priest remained in Italian custody, however, and was brought to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for interrogation by investigating magistrate <PERSON> Margherita </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerunda </PERSON>, who issued the arrest warrant March 29. Asked about extradition, the judge replied: `` He was arrested on a warrant issued by the Italian judicial authority. ... He is expected to be tried in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The main judicial authority is in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' Judge <PERSON> Gerunda </PERSON> added, however, that there `` might be some political considerations, perhaps a temporary extradition,'' because <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON> is an American citizen. She said charges against <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> include associating with organized crime, criminal association for drug trafficking, importation of drugs, counterfeiting and illegal exportation of art works. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official said privately that extradition is expected `` in due course'' but `` first you have to go through all the formal procedures.''

 Ethiopian rebels accused <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist government on Thursday of trying to starve people by ordering foreign relief workers out of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, regions hit by drought and war The government told international relief agencies Wednesday to recall all their foreign workers in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> `` to avoid personnel security risks'' from rebels. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it was `` seriously concerned'' about the action. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` We are studying the situation. We are studying what steps to take next. ... Our concern is to have humanitarian aid delivered.'' Two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s overall, $ 145 million food aid program is delivered to about 3 million drought victims through non-governmental aid agencies. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> asked donors and the relief agencies affected by its order to turn over their operations to the <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency responsible for drought and famine relief. The rebels' clandestine radio station said in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> calls on all charitable organizations and those cooperating with them to oppose the dergue's -LRB- <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> leadership's -RRB- inhuman step and to help the starving people in any way possible.'' It said the order was intended `` to starve the people of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON> and cow them into submission. `` For this purpose, the dergue intends to put the charitable organizations' food, vehicles and other services to military use.'' Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the central government in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war. In neighboring Tigre, another separatist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has been fighting for 14 years. The hostilities have disrupted relief efforts in both regions, where crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation. Overall, nearly 7 million Ethiopians face famine without outside help. About 60 non-governmental relief organizations operate in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but only a few operate in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre.

 A fundraising campaign aimed at providing vaccines to immunize the world's children against six deadly and disabling diseases was announced Thursday by several celebrities and two public service organizations. `` There are seven children dying every minute somewhere in the world because of these diseases and an additional seven disabled by them every minute,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pigman </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s immunization task force. `` This can all be prevented if only if we can deliver vaccines in that critical first year of a baby's life _ vaccines that cost well under a dollar for all six'' diseases, he added. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The goal is to immunize all the world's children by 1990. We want to get the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> community involved in promoting this campaign.'' While no specific monetary goal has been set by the two groups, <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON> said the funds raised by their `` Chance of a Lifetime'' campaign will be turned over to <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, CARE, Save the <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, Project Concern and other reputable groups to deliver the vaccines to Third World nations. The vaccines are those meant to prevent measles, polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and tuberculosis, which kill 3 -LCB- million children and disable another 3 -LCB- million each year, <PERSON> Pigman </PERSON> said. Campaign spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said syndicated TV situation comedy stars attending Thursday's kickoff were <PERSON> Dyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortelli </PERSON> and 8-year-old <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, both of `` <LOCATION> Marblehead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>;'' 11-year-old <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>, of `` <PERSON> Punky </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>;'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>, of `` Three's Company;'' and 11-year-old <PERSON> Taliesin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, of `` She's The Sheriff. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeton </PERSON>, who suffered polio and stars in <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Young and the Restless'' soap opera also attended, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON> said his group will arrange for celebrities to solicit donations by appearing on talk shows and to broadcast public service announcements.

 Police returned with a new search warrant Thursday to a house where skulls and bone fragments were found after a man said he was tortured and sexually abused there for four days last week. The owner of the house, flea market merchant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, is jailed without bond on seven counts of forcible sodomy and one each of felonious restraint and first-degree assault. The alleged offenses all involve a 22-year-old man who wore only a dog collar when he escaped from <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s home by jumping from a second-floor window on Saturday. Authorities who arrested <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, 39, said they found pictures of the man being tortured and abused, and similar pictures of other young men, one of whom appeared to be dead. Police have been looking for possible links between <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION> and 11 missing persons cases, including those of two young men with whom he was reportedly seen. His arrest led to the discovery of two human skulls, one apparently a relic, in the home, while another was unearthed from the backyard, along with bone fragments. It has not yet been determined if those fragments are human. Police said Thursday that an interview with a carpenter who had helped build a deck at the back of the house led authorities to believe they might find more skulls or skeletons under the deck. But they began their work Thursday by using power saws to cut through planks of the front porch. `` We do n't want to take a chance on overlooking anything,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. `` We're not going to leave that stone unturned.'' He also said the investigative team working on the case had been increased from six detectives to 11 so police can follow up on calls from people who claim to have known <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>. Police are still trying to identify eight young men in hundreds of bondage pictures found in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s home.

<TEXT>
 A white South African lawyer who was jailed for anti-apartheid activities in the 1960s was seriously wounded Thursday when a bomb exploded in his car, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>'s right hand was nearly severed from his arm in the blast, which occurred as he opened his car door outside his apartment in downtown <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, the agency said. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> was in very serious condition after an operation, hospital sources told AIM. The news agency said a 33-year-old Mozambican man, <PERSON> Ishmael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussagy </PERSON>, suffered a serious head wound from bits of metal flying from the booby-trapped car, and the man's 3-year-old son was slightly injured. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, was jailed by South African authorities for more than three months without charge in 1963. He also defended members of the anti-apartheid group, which was banned in 1960. He was one of the few white people who participated in the congress' 1960 defiance campaign, which urged people to ignore apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1963 after being released from jail. He wrote a book about his experiences, `` The Prison Diary of <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>,'' which was turned into a play in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He worked in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> before going to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where he lectured at the national university in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> until recently. He works for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in the capital, AIM said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, a political scientist at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foremost expert on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> was not working for the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and was not an officer in the organization, which is made up mostly of blacks. The attack is the latest in a series carried out against <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members outside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. At least six <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members have been killed outside the country this year. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has denied responsibility for the deaths, although it repeatedly warns it will cross its borders in pursuit of <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s blacks have no vote in national afairs. The whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Britons freed from a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Thursday the seizure was frightening but the Arab gunmen soon relaxed and became `` quite considerate.'' The 22 Britons were among two groups of hostages freed by hijackers who forced the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which was en route from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, to land early Tuesday at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said all the freed Britons were `` fit and well.'' Several spoke to <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before leaving for home. Various reports put the number of hijackers at five to seven. They demand the relase of 17 pro-Iranian extremists convicted and imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> sheikdom in 1983. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carew-Jones </PERSON>, an advertising executive from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the hijacking began as passengers slept. `` Suddenly there was a lot of shouting and we saw the terrorists with grenades and we were told to put our hands on our heads and look down,'' she said. `` When you see people with grenades and guns you have to fear for your life.'' After 15 or 20 minutes the passengers were `` herded together in one section of the plane'' and told to keep their hands on their heads until the landing at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, she said. `` Then they told us to relax and be calm, and they were fine,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Carew-Jones </PERSON> said. `` They were quite relaxed themselves by then. Nobody panicked.'' `` They were quite considerate,'' she said, allowing her to change seats to sit with her husband <PERSON> David </PERSON>. They gave oxygen to passengers who felt ill when the cabin grew stuffy, she added. Social worker <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, also from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the hostages were `` treated very well.'' There was `` no violence, no aggression,'' he said. `` Obviously we were very frightened and intimidated for the first two or three hours, but once we landed things settled down.'' An Austrian businessman among those released said the gunmen were brutal when they seized the plane but later treated the hostages well. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON>, 53, who manages the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, said all the hijackers wore masks and they spoke English to non-Arab passengers. At the outset, crew members were forced to lie on the floor with their hands behind their heads and some passengers were handcuffed, <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON> said. `` At this stage things were quite brutal,'' he said, `` but they told passengers repeatedly to be calm, not to worry. They were really very friendly to us.'' <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON> said the air conditioning system failed to work at times and it became very hot inside the aircraft, but `` the treatment was excellent otherwise, with plenty of food and water.''

<TEXT>
 A jury was selected Thursday in the trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> after four days of questions about attitudes towards drugs and the prominence of the defendant's mother, former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24, is charged with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover agent. Opening arguments in the case are scheduled for Friday morning, and attorneys said the trial could last three days. The 12 jurors and two alternates were selected from more than 60 <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION> area residents, who were also questioned about their attitudes toward undercover police work. Among those dismissed was a man who described people interested in police work as fascist. District Court Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> had initially refused to dismiss the potential juror, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON>, on Wednesday, despite objections from the prosecutor. Under questioning, <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON> had said, `` I have often felt that some people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background. They like to have power.'' On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> renewed the argument, telling the judge that <PERSON> Mayka </PERSON> `` has preconceived notions about police officers. He feels police officers generally are on power trips.'' The feelings about police are important in the case because the defense wants to show that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was entrapped by an undercover police officer acting only on a rumor that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> might be selling drugs. Jury selection was prolonged by the wide publicity given the case. Most potential jurors said they were aware of the case, prompting lawyers to repeatedly ask whether this knowledge would affect their deliberations. Only one juror was dismissed for acknowleging that the prominence of <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> could affect his view. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, were present for the questioning.

<TEXT>
 About 180 tons of material, presumed to be components for cluster bombs, were shipped from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since June, police said Thursday. Italian law forbids sale or supply of arms to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> or to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which have been at war in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since September 1980. Officials here said two men were arrested and a third was sought. The shipments were halted with the March 24 seizure at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> da Vinci airport of nearly 27 tons of bomb parts about to be loaded on an Iraqi Airways jet bound for <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, said officials of the carabinieri, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s paramilitary police force An added 33 tons of parts, waiting to be transported to the airport and eventually to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, also were seized recently in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the police said. Customs declarations were falsified to describe the components as parts for furniture or spare parts for home appliances or plumbing repair, the police said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said documents examined by police showed the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> ordered the shipments and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government provided, for export agents in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, a letter of credit for $ 8 million to cover dealings with Italian factories manufacturing the parts. Cluster bombs, designed to spread shrapnel over a wide area, are an effective anti-personnel weapon. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used such bombs to break up mass Iranian ground assaults. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped cluster bombs in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> against villages which it says were also hit by chemical bombs March 16-17. Police reported finding <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government documents outlining which components were needed for the cluster bombs. A police official said other bomb components, 16 tons in all, were seized at 27 small factories that received the Iraqi orders. A few factories are in the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> area; others are in <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION>. No one answered at the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> when called for comment. Police said Thursday the two men arrested were charged with construction, export and illegal holding of war arms. Both worked for an import-export firm in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> that police said arranged the bomb parts delivery. Officers identified them as Iraqi-born <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kodasi </PERSON>, 30, an Italian citizen, and <PERSON> Hamoudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasim </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Police said they a third man sought is an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION>. They said no charges have been brought against factory officials. The parts ranged from metal tubes and cones, which the factories described as plumbing pieces, to plastic connecting parts listed on the inventory as table legs, police said. Several investigations are being carried out in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> into the alleged supply of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by Italian arms manufacturers.

<TEXT>
 The government on Thursday night apparently backtracked on its claim that the army killed `` four <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> terrorists'' in an attack on a house in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> 10 days ago. A South African television report indicated only one of the dead was an operative of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and that any connection between two of those killed and the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was uncertain. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> itself on Thursday, in a letter from the office of President <PERSON> Quett </PERSON> <PERSON> Masire </PERSON>, demanded an apology and compensation for `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s unprovoked act of aggression.'' It earlier called the attack `` cold-blooded murder of four innocent people in their sleep.'' The South African <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said March 28 that the three women and one man killed in its pre-dawn assault on the house, which was blown up, were all <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> `` terrorists.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen refused to say at the time who they had killed but insisted the identities were known. The <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> government said the three women were Batswana civilians and the man was a South African refugee who had been in the country since 1979. All were buried Thursday in <LOCATION> Gaborone </LOCATION>, the capital. Government-run South African TV said Thursday night in reporting on the burial that the dead man was a senior <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> commander and that `` at least one -LRB- of the three women -RRB- was involved with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> identified the man as <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Molefi </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Naledi </PERSON>, and said he was <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> regional commander in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> said the man was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, a South African refugee, and that neither he nor the three women were <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members. It called <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s identification of the man `` deliberate fabrication.'' <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s government supports the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of ending white-minority domination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but says it does not allow guerrillas to launch cross-border attacks from its territory. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> also said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` has failed to substantiate its allegation'' that <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> was being used as a transit route for <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, wages a bombing and sabotage campaign trying to overthrow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government. Since the March 28 raid, several South African tourists said they were harassed while visiting <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. `` The Department of Foreign Affairs wishes to lodge strong protest ... for the aggravated actions launched by the <ORGANIZATION> Botswana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> against tourists,'' said a diplomatic note sent to <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has not responded to <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s demand for compensation for the attack.

 Armed Jewish settlers vowed revenge Thursday and shouted `` Expel the Arabs!'' as they buried an Israeli girl killed in a clash with Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Troops killed an Arab in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, the town where 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was slain the day before. The army said he disobeyed an order to halt. Autopsy results released by the army showed that the girl, <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, was shot in the head and also struck in the head by a stone or large object. An army official said the cause of death could not immediately be determined. Shortly after <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> died Wednesday, the army said she was killed by a bullet, but then said she was stoned to death by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villagers. An <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television report raised the possibility that <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was inadvertently shot by a Jewish settlers during the clash. Soldiers arrested hundreds of Arabs and blew up five homes Thursday in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, while armed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians rampaged through two nearby villages, beating Arabs, breaking windows and firing shots in the air. An army announcement said the Palestinian fatally shot Thursday was a suspect in the attack on 16 Israeli teen-agers the day before. The group was on a holiday outing accompanied by two adult settlers armed with automatic rifles. In addition to <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON>, two Arabs were killed in the Wednesday melee. Two Arabs were wounded and 13 Israelis injured. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted army investigators as saying <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was shot, but also struck in the head by a stone hurled by the mother and sister of an Arab killed in the clash. The radio report said the two women were under arrest. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> cited an unidentified military source as saying <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was wounded by a bullet fired by the gun of one of the Israeli settlers. The army said that during the clash, villagers in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> wrested guns away from the Israeli guards. However, the army source said the magazines of the two weapons probably were empty at that time. He gave no details. There was no indication any other weapons were fired during the clash. `` <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>'s only crime was taking a walk in her country,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told about 9,000 mourners who gathered under heavy guard at the region's Jewish cemetery. `` God will avenge her blood.'' <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> lived in the <ORGANIZATION> Elon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moreh </ORGANIZATION> settlement overlooking the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The girl, killed during the weeklong Passover celebration, was the first <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian victim of the 4-month-old violence in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 war. At least 141 Arabs have died, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was stabbed to death. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on Thursday, the last full day of his second shuttle to promote a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan. About 100 Israeli soldiers were stationed along the 15-mile route of the funeral procession Thursday from <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreh </PERSON> to the <PERSON> Karnei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> cemetery. The procession inched through the heart of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, then passed a dozen <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villages whose streets were deserted. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzover </PERSON>, president of the settlement council, said Jewish settlers would protest daily in front of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office until the government toughened its policies in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where 65,000 Jewish settlers and 850,000 Palestinians live. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, army commander in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were rounded up in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> and surrounding villages. Rabbi <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> should be demolished. `` When an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> village carried out a pogrom on Israeli children, there's nothing to do but destroy the village, to wipe it out from the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON> declared. Some people shouted `` Revenge, revenge!'' and `` Expel the Arabs!'' Others hit news photographers, accusing the media of feeding the violence. After the funeral, <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreh </PERSON> settlers entered the adjacent <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Deir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatab </LOCATION>, and fired shots into the air until troops ordered them out. Jewish settlers went on an overnight rampage in nearby <LOCATION> Hawwara </LOCATION>, breaking windows and beating some Arabs. `` Every house on the main road is in danger of attack now. They want to kill us,'' said <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawwara </LOCATION>. He had a swollen lip and a cut on his right cheek. He said settlers beat him and broke seven windows in his home and his car windshield.

 Police arrested 53 people and broke up a Canadian car theft ring that made $ 3.25 million in seven months and peddled stolen car parts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> provinicial police spokesman said Thursday.

By then a car, bearing the badly needed part, would have been stolen,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The arrests were made in 77 early-morning raids Wednesday following a seven-month investigation. All of the suspects are Canadians, mostly from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said they faced a variety of charges in court. He said one is an official of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s vehicle bureau who will be charged with complicity in the marketing of stolen cars and parts. `` It's the biggest organized -LRB- car theft -RRB- ring ever smashed in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said police still were investigating some of the garages that ordered the parts to determine if they knew they were obtaining stolen goods.

<HEAD>Up to $9.2 Billion Needed To Upgrade Existing Public Housing,
Report Says</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> estimates it will cost up to $ 9.2 billion to make the nation's existing public housing `` decent, safe and sanitary.'' The estimate, in a report issued for publication Friday, is based on inspection of 2,196 units and 3,120 buildings at public housing projects across the country at the end of 1985. It took more than two years and $ 5 million to compile and review the final report which was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Since then, said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> deputy assistant secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON>, $ 3.9 billion has been spent. He said another study to be completed this summer will show how much needs to be spent each year to keep public housing at mandatory <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> standards. The study released by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said repair and renovation of existing units among the 1.3 million dwellings nationwide will cost between $ 7.5 billion and $ 9.2 billion. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is committed to restoring the public housing stock to decent, safe and sanitary conditions in every instance where that housing is viable,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. The report indicates that only 5 percent to 10 percent of public housing is not viable and not worth modernizing. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> mandatory modernization standards include repairs and changes to `` preserve public health and safety, ensure bulding integrity, meet local code requirements and meet federal standards for accessibliity for the handicapped as well as reduction of hazards associated with lead-based paint,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> statement accompanying the study. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said half the nation's public housing has been in service for between 20 and 40 years. He said that after the backlog is met, additional funds will be needed from federal, state and local governments. The 283-page report, `` Study of the Modernization Needs of the Public and <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION>,'' was based on data gathered by <ORGANIZATION> Abt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Its estimates cover 11,000 public housing projects, where low-income families live, paying about 30 percent of their incomes as rent. Individual housing authorities own the units, aided by federal assistance and financing. Officials say 3 million Americans live in public housing.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it was suspending its effort to mediate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis as the first major split appeared in the opposition to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said in a statement he was withdrawing his mediation offer for three reasons: _ Opposition groups refused to talk to the government until it showed it was willing to discuss the departure of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ The archbishop had not received <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` explicit and personal backing of the initiative'' in writing _ There were no assurances that the four international leaders who proposed the talks could be present The breakdown came a day after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ordered the arrests of several leading opponents. The general has defied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to force his resignation. In another development, banking and diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks would not reopen Friday, and possibly not next week. The government said last week it hoped to have banks functioning again Friday. A major rift appeared Thursday in the anti-Noriega opposition, as two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own anti-government movement. Their leaders argued that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions are hurting <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s people more than they are damaging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the civilian government he controls. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, announced formation of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in a break with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of about 200 organizations that has led the 10-month-old effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. They told a news conference their movement also is backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition political party. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has supported the Civic Crusade in its effort to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as chief of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which include the military and police. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, which he denies. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said the new movement rejects any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence. `` For us, no recipe that comes from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been favorable to the Panamanians,'' he said. `` The people of the world know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, never are favorable to the interests of the people.'' He added: `` It is absolutely necessary for Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to abandon his post. For us, this is fundamental.'' Leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations, strikes and other protests of the Civic Crusade, while differing with some of its policies and generally favoring a harder line. Popular Action, for example, refused to join the Crusade, Authentic Panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to the proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the Catholic church. The dialogue was proposed by Presidents <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and ex-presidents <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Political parties linked most closely with the Civic Crusade are the Democratic Christians and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Molirena </PERSON>. Those two parties, the Crusade and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> all recognize deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the constitutional head of state. Popular Action and the Authentic Panamanian Party do not. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> orchestrated the ouster of <LOCATION> Delvalle </LOCATION> on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, brother of a former Popular Action presidential candidate, said the movement `` will center its fight on the original principles of the Civic Crusade.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not continue economic and military action against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arosemena </PERSON> said. `` The Panamanian people are capable of solving their own problems.'' Banking and diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said bank would not open Friday even on a limited basis. They said bankers feared the government would use their deposits if they reopened. The government, whose deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks have been frozen, has not met public payrolls since the crisis began. The last of 1,300 additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers arrived Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, completing a buildup meant to provide greater security for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, American installations and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Late Wednesday, the government said it had issued arrest warrants for three leading opponents, including <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It also asked <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the international police organization, to arrest <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON>, a former ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s envoy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and remains there. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would regard any efforts by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime to attempt arrests or prosecutions of President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and the others for their activities in urging and supporting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions as the unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime.''

<HEAD>Student Posters Criticize Educational Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading university put up posters this week criticizing government education policy, but unlike student protesters in 1986, they made no sweeping calls for democracy. The official response so far also has been more restrained. The posters have been allowed to stay up for days on <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s main bulletin board. In 1986, tens of thousands of students at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and schools in other cities put up posters and took to the streets demanding more democracy. Authorities were lenient at first, but cracked down when they thought the students became too bold. Posters were torn down and students were ordered back to campus. The authorities' decision to leave the latest posters alone appeared to be an example of a new government openness which is being promted during the present session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hao </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s student association, noted that most of the opinions advanced in the posters have been expressed by congress delegates or printed in the official press. He said it was normal that students should raise such complaints. He and other students said the posters contained no radical ideas and should not be interpreted as signs of widespread student discontent. A lengthy `` open letter'' directed to <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> delegates was posted Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and on Thursday other posters were put up which picked apart official educational policy and proposed reforms. Students said an `` open letter'' would be presented to the congress demanding that more money be spent on education and charging that leaders were neglecting education in their attempts to modernize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Some of the posters opposed a proposal from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> which would require students and faculty to earn money for their universities by running their own factories or hiring themselves out to other businesses. Students regard the idea as further evidence that the leadership is unwilling to invest in education and instead wants students and teachers to fend for themselves. One poster called on students to express their displeasure with the idea by going to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to earn money by shining shoes. About 80 students were gathered at about noon Thursday, reading and discussing the posters. Most seemed to agree with the criticisms. Presidents of four of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s major universities, including <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, told the English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> last week that state funding falls far short of their operating needs.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Thursday ended their annual military field training exercise involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from the American continent and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> areas, a military announcement said. The 10-day field exercise, which was held at various parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, was the highlight of Team Spirit 88 which involved about 200,000 troops from the two countries. The announcement from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said that all deployed forces will return to their home bases by early May. The command said Team Spirit, which was first held in 1976, was designed to improve defensive readiness of South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces through joint operations. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has attached a special meaning to the joint exercise because <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> threatens to disrupt the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Games. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> has refused to take part in the Games unless its demand to be made a cohost is met. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said Tuesday while on a visit here that the exercise was `` a valuable demonstraton of our commitment to preserving peace ... and timely in this year of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has pledged to provide necessary security support to prevent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from disrupting the Games. Also on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to introduce at least 24 more F-16 fighters this year to improve combat capability of its tactical fighter wing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said its 51st Tactical Fighter Wing here would replace F-4E Phantom II fighters now in service with F-16 fighters this fall. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the introduction of F-16 <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> would help meet military threat from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the modernization of the Soviet military in the region. Currently, 12 F-4E Phamtom fighters are assigned to two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air bases in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> each: the 36th <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Osan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> 497th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, they said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> statement said the 36th TFS will receive 24 F-16C and D models in October 1989 to improve and modernize its combat capability and readiness. The 497th TFS in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> will be deactivated early next year in line with budget cuts, with its 12 F-4E Phantom fighters to be released for foreign sales, the statement said.

<TEXT>
 The men in `` Borderlines,'' the umbrella title for two new one-act plays by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, sure have their problems. `` Right now I'm having trouble connecting to things,'' admits <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the protagonist in the evening's pretentious curtain-raiser. It's called `` Borderline'' without the `` s,'' presumably to mark its anti-hero's precarious state of mind. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is a yuppyish marketing specialist who sells things like shampoo and toothpaste, but his mind is not on his work. He worries about his stale marriage, frets about the big basketball game he blew in high school, commiserates and drinks with a crude co-worker, sleeps with a young secretary and finally kills the woman's jealous boyfriend. In between these episodes, a lecturer appears on stage to outline <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' violent family tree which she traces back several centuries to the border wars between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. His ancestors made their way to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where they were involved in one disastrous episode after another _ from <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> wars in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to battles between cowboys and sheepmen in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and fights over land in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> suggests that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' homicidal nature was preordained. It's in man's genes and no amount of moping about and worrying is going to change things. Much of the same anxiety pervades `` Keepin' An Eye On <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>,'' the second and much more successful half of the evening. This time, the man at sea with himself is <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>, a policeman who keeps a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mobster named <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> under surveillance. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> is just as miserable as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> but in this play, the dialogue crackles with blue-collar banter. There are a lot of jokes about members of the mob with first names like Bananas or Tomatoes or <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Also enlivening the proceedings is the appearance _ in drag _ of <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>'s recalcitrant son-in-law, who has decided to help the police and identify members of the mob. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> also ca n't communicate with his wife. The reason is never made clear, although the playwright paints a picture of a man closer to his job and his fellow police officers than the woman he married. It's an unsatisfactory portrait. The cast is first-rate, particularly <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as the distraught executive in the first play and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> as the unnerved policeman in the second. They bring a conviction to their roles that is not supported by the writing. Despite those performances and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s fluid direction, `` Borderlines,'' which arrived Thursday at off-Broadway's <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repertory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, never becomes much more than two morose, murky tales of male menopause.

 Jurors acquitted 13 white supremacists Thursday of charges including conspiring to overthrow the federal government and to kill a federal judge and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. The all-white jury returned the verdict in its fourth day of deliberations, a day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> refused to accept the panel's statement that it was deadlocked on two of the counts. The defendants included three leaders of white supremacist groups: <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Asked how the seven-week trial affected the white supremacist movement, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said, `` Who knows? What movement? What's left of it after this?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> said he thought the government had proved its case but `` we accept the verdict of the jury.'' Nine defendants were charged with seditious conspiracy, accused of wanting to overthrow the government and start an all-white nation in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Five were accused of conspiring to kill the federal officials, and two also were charged with transporting stolen money across state lines. Six of the defendants are already serving prison terms for other crimes. The jury reached a verdict Wednesday on the charge involving the judge and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, but <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> ordered it sealed until deliberations were complete. The government said supremacist groups robbed banks and armored trucks of $ 4.1 million, including about $ 1 million that still is missing. The defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key government witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, who led a supremacist group in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and now is serving 20 years for racketeering. `` The government was going to send a message to the movement. The movement sent a message to the government. The message was the same one God told pharoah, ` Let my people go,''' said <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, the national chaplain of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON>, who hugged several of the defendants after the verdict was announced. <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON> said it was not a political trial. `` We were n't after them for what they believed or what they said, but what they did,'' he said. He declined to say whether any investigations of a similar nature are under way and said he did not know the cost of the trial. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, national chairman of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said in a statement from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the verdicts were `` a real setback in the war against organized hate.'' `` Although many of the defendants are already serving prison terms growing out of their extremist activities, the others, including the most important leaders, will now be free to once again promote their anti-democratic and bigoted aims. The outcome means that we must and will remain vigilant,'' <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> celebrated his acquittal by going to a Confederate memorial opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he called the `` Zionist occupation government.'' `` There are over 150 other political prisoners being held in <ORGANIZATION> ZOG </ORGANIZATION>'s jails that need to be freed,'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said. `` I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today. I think everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was simply being punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent of ZOG.'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON>, fainted and was carried a block to an attorney's office by her husband.

 A grand jury Thursday indicted two state legislators, the mayor and 13 other political figures in a mountain coal county already wracked by charges of job-selling and drug-dealing by local officials. One indictment charged a state senator who was a former county commissioner with bribery in the alleged sale of the <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's job in 1982 for $ 100,000, and another indictment accused 15 others of violations of state election laws and conspiracy. The 15 are accused of conspiring with <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, the former sheriff and former county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and others to influence elections in 1984 and 1986 and law enforcement in the county. `` The indictment charges this group of people with attempting basically to subvert the free election system in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said special prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Colburn </PERSON>. `` They conspired ... by illegal campaign contributions, by illegal campaign expenditures, by bribery, by false accounting, and by conspiring to do all these things.'' <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the site of the Hatfied-McCoy Fued between mountain clans after the Civil War, is a coal-mining county of 37,000 people along the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, the largest town, has about 6,000 residents. A federal grand jury indicted several current and former county officials over the past year, including current Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, in connection with his appointment as sheriff. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, who has pleaded guilty, said he accepted a $ 20,000 down payment on the $ 100,000 bribe from <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, then persuaded the three county commissioners to accept his resignation and appoint <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> in exchange for half of the bribe. Former Commissioner <PERSON> Rastie </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> also has pleaded guilty and will be sentenced with <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> on April 18, the same day <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> is scheduled to enter a plea in a drug case as part of an agreement with prosecutors. In the drug case, authorities say a drug ring openly run by a small-town fire chief, police chief and their families was protected by a web of bribes to officials. Commissioner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, the only member of the 1982 <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> still in office, was indicted earlier on one count of bribery. He has denied the charge but is not running for re-election. The third commissioner, state Sen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON>, was indicted Thursday with one felony count of bribery. Arraignment for all defendants is scheduled Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Mingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> was charged with two counts of bribery, one count of conspiracy and one count of filing false accounts _ all felonies _ and one count each of making political contributions exceeding the state limits and failing to report political expenditures, both misdemeanors. <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was indicted on five felony counts, three counts of bribery and one each of conspiracy and filing false accounts, plus two misdemeanors. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapourales </PERSON> was indicted on two felony counts _ bribery and conspiracy _ and two misdemeanor counts. <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> denied having anything to do with sale of the sheriff's office `` I received no money or benefit as a result of this transaction,'' he said. `` I was not there when the commission voted on these matters, nor did I agree with anyone at any time not to be present at that meeting.'' Fanning was out of his office late Thursday afternoon and was unavailable for comment, a person answering the phone in his office said. Neither <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Kapourales </PERSON> was in his office and could not be reached for comment by telephone. Also named as defendants are county school board members <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, former Delegates <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> K.O </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON>, and <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Meter </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, County Commissioners <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumora </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohari </PERSON>, Magistrate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Clerk <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, former County Clerk <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, a former school board member and former director of the county's anti-poverty agency Also indicted Thursday was <ORGANIZATION> Goodwill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a used car dealership at <LOCATION> Delbarton </LOCATION> owned by former county commissioner and county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> Justice.

 Airport workers in northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> refueled a Kuwaiti jetliner and its Arab hijackers said they would take off Friday morning with about 50 hostages held for three days, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s news agency reported. The plane was refueled after the hijackers fired at security guards at the <LOCATION> Masshad </LOCATION> airport and threatened to force the pilot to fly with the little fuel left in the jet's tanks, said the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It first quoted the hijackers as saying the plane would leave at midnight -LRB- 4:30 p.m. EDT -RRB-, in a dispatch filed only two minutes before that time, and said later the departure had been delayed until 6 a.m. -LRB- 10:30 p.m. EDT -RRB-. The second departure time passed with no new word from <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. No destination was given. According to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, Iranian officials asked the hijackers for the extension to provide time for the Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers, <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, to talk to <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials in an effort to convinve them to accept the hijackers' demand The hijackers, said to number five to seven, want <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to free 17 pro-Iran extremists convicted and imprisoned in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> sheikdom for bombings at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> spoke by telephone with Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Thursday. It said <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> his government wanted to end the incident without `` any unhappy event,'' but added: `` Of course you should know that our possibilities are limited and therefore we hope the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government will understand the restrictions in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> and fulfil its humanitarian duty, in trying to bring the problem to a peaceful end.'' Thirty-two people were released from the plane early Thursday and, along with 25 freed earlier, left <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the agency reported. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said early Friday that the passengers had arrived in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The hijacking occurred early Tuesday, as the plane with 112 people aboard was flying from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported the original departure time, it said `` there are still obstacles on the runway,'' placed there earlier by airport officials to keep the jet from taking off. On the third day of the drama, the hijackers said they placed explosives throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which still had 55 passengers and crew aboard, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Among the hostages are three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family. One appealed to Iranian authorities to provide jet fuel, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're very tired and our brothers -LRB- the hijackers -RRB- are very serious in their threat to blow up the plane,'' <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> told the control tower by radio, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The hijackers fired several shots out of the plane Thursday after repeating their demand for fuel, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not mention casualties. Iranian media and some of the freed hostages have described the hijackers as masked, Arabic-speaking men armed with pistols and hand grenades. One of the passengers, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Degeorgi </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the gunmen carried handguns and claimed to have hand grenades. He said there were seven and that all wore masks. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, freed British passenger <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefton </PERSON> was quoted Thursday as saying that two of the hijackers offered her pillows and drinks and chatted with her daughters in English. `` We did n't have time to be frightened, things happened so fast,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sefton </PERSON> told <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> had reported that Iranian officials were refusing to supply fuel or food to the hijackers unless the passengers and crew were released. But the refueling went ahead without any more releases reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> paraphrased an Iranian negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Ali-Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Moayyeri </PERSON>, as saying a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> negotiating team in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> `` does not take the issue -LRB- of the hijacking -RRB- seriously.'' <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has rejected the hijackers' demands. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that the government sent a letter to <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> praising <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s efforts to end the hijacking but opposing any moves to allow the plane to leave. Numerous acts of terrorism in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have been blamed on Shiite Moslems acting with backing from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which acccuses <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the Iran-Iraq war. Kuwaiti diplomats were brought home after their embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was ransacked. <LOCATION> Bahraini </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said passports held by five alleged Bahrainis aboard the plane must be fake. They said that when the passport numbers were provided by authorities in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and checked in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, they did not match with the names given. No positive breakdown by nationality of the remaining hostages was possible, due to discrepancies between lists released by <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> and by the airline's offices in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>.

 Winds howling across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Wednesday with gusts to 75 mph defaced <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> landmarks and caused widespread damage and power outages across <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and neighboring states. More than 60 windows cracked or blew out in the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the world's tallest building at 1,452 feet. A 13-foot spire plummeted 28 stories from the top of the white, terra-cotta-covered Wrigley Building overlooking the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The winds, which were expected to diminish overnight, whipped up waves as high as 20 feet on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said meteorologist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, which serves 3 million northeastern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> customers, reported 30,000 without power at midafternoon, but said most would have their electricity restored Wednesday night. The winds disrupted transportation in the region by flooding low-lying roads, downing trees and creating hazards for tractor-trailers and other high-profile vehicles. Delays of about an hour were reported at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and Midway airports. Wind gusts up to 50 mph kicked up 14-foot waves on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, more than 2 inches of rain flooded roads and sent small rivers over their banks, the weather service said. In northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, gale-force winds gusting as high as 92 mph carried marble-sized hail, heavy rains and even snow, just a day after afternoon highs had reached the 80s. Two truck drivers were injured when their rigs were blown onto their sides on Interstate 70, and flying glass from shattered windows injured at least two others in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, authorities said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police cordoned off the streets around the 110-story <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, and some workers there moved out of their offices as high winds assaulted the windows. `` With some 16,000 windows in total, although the number of windows broken or damaged is a significant number ... it proves that the basic design is good,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Across town at the Wrigley Building, the metal spire fell to the sidewalk, which was then cordoned off. `` There's never been anything like that happen,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> of the Wm. Wrigley Jr.. Co The wind began rising late Tuesday, and six people were treated and released for injuries suffered when a store window blew out in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Trees were uprooted, and extensive damage was reported to planes and hangars at the city airport, and to roofs of homes there.

 Police ended a three-hour siege Wednesday by fatally shooting a suicidal 20-year-old man who had held his young girlfriend hostage apparently with a fake gun, authorities said. Israel <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> died Wednesday afternoon of a single gunshot wound at <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he had been taken for surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said. The hostage, a 14-year-old runaway whose name was withheld by authorities, was not injured. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> had held what appeared to be an automatic gun to the girl's head, which was covered by a pillowcase. Authorities originally said that a police sharpshooter fired at <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> after the hostage taker said, `` I am now going to kill her.'' But film shot by WGAL-TV in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was hit by a bullet moments after he swore at police and said `` I'm coming out.'' Both <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>' hands were on a window ledge, no gun was apparent and the girl was out of view. As soon as <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was shot in the abdomen, the teen came to the window shouting for an ambulance. Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hose </PERSON>, who was not present at the shooting, said the initial accounts may have been wrong and that the incident was being investigated. State police were called in to assist. The chief said a handgun and an Uzi-type rifle found in <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>' apartment appeared to be fakes The sharpshooter's name was not released. During the siege, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> tossed radios, a stereo, pizza boxes and shoes from the window as he swore at police and asked whether he should beat his hostage.

 Working indoors may be hazardous to your health after all, suggests a study that says modern, energy efficient buildings may significantly increase the risk of communicable respiratory infections.

But the researchers said the findings may apply to office buildings and other structures designed for maximum energy efficiency.

<HEAD>ABC Drug Documentary a Combo Effort With Affiliates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> decided to do a documentary on just how pervasive the drug problem is all across the country, the result was an unusual collaboration between the network and about 40 of its affiliates. `` Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land,'' airs Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. It is anchored by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and features several network correspondents, but includes on-camera reports by local correspondents as well as a lot of affiliate-provided tape. The opening montage, set to the urgent rock beat of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, includes footage from 14 affiliates showing drug busts in small towns, drug busts in big cities, police breaking into crack houses and emergency workers picking up victims of drug-related gang wars. `` What we have done for the first time, I think, is created a news network division as opposed to network news division,'' said executive producer <PERSON> Av </PERSON> <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>. `` We've put together in one place in one hour at one time the resources of our 212 affiliates, plus the resources of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> to bring to the public in a concentrated way a clear demonstration of what drugs are doing to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' CBS' `` see-it-now'' - style `` 48 Hours on Crack Street'' has become the definitive drug documentary of late `` A Plague Upon the Land'' has a completely different focus, said <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>. `` ` 48 Hours on Crack Street' made it sound like it -LRB- the drug problem -RRB- was in one place, and it was kind of an adventure, and our team was right in there and is n't it terrible?'' said <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>. Although he praised the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> documentary, he said viewers, at the end of it, could be expected to say, `` Well, that's on 42nd Street. That's on Crack Street. It's not in my town.' `` This is a call to action,'' <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> said of his documentary. `` We are angry.'' In delivering the conclusion of the documentary, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> is less angry than inquiring. `` We do n't have specific answers to the crisis we've identified tonight,'' he says. `` But like you, we're kind of angry and we have a lot of questions. If this is a war on drugs, and everyone from the president on down has called it that, should n't it be fought like a war?'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> lists, and then discounts, some of the wilder suggested solutions _ such as the death penalty for drug dealers or search-and-destroy missions to foreign lands that produce drugs. The documentary makes no attempt to ask why people, even privileged people, take drugs in the first place, and how a society can convince poverty-stricken, disenfranchised youths that taking drugs, and taking money for drugs, is wrong. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> suggests presidential candidates should come up with some answers, but he does say, `` One thing we should keep in perspective: you ca n't win the war against drugs unless you attack poverty and illiteracy. And remember, for the poor coca farmer in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> as well as the poor kid dealing drugs in our streets, it's the only way they're making any money. `` This is not a broadcast about how it comes in across the border,'' <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> said. `` It is not a broadcast about why Americans use it. It is a broadcast about the fact it is here in terrifying amounts and it is destroying the fabric of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The documentary is indeed effective in demonstrating the pervasiveness of the drug problem. It would seem if you do n't get gunned down in the cross fire of a gang war, you might get on a plane whose pilot is under the influence or get left sitting in a hospital emergency room with your broken arm while the staff is occupied with restraining a psychotic PCP user. `` None of us is safe, no matter where you live,'' says the father of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officer who was shot to death as he guarded the home of a drug trial witness. It was that slaying that prompted the documentary, <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> showed a rough cut of the documentary, he provided a running commentary: `` Local correspondent ... network correspondent ... local pictures, our correspondent ... local video ... network video ...'' He said the final cut of the documentary will have a graphic crediting each affiliates, who were paid for their contributions.

<HEAD>Former State Supreme Court Chief Justice Has New Careers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` I've never been an ideologue,'' says <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, who was voted out of office for being, in the minds of many, exactly that. As a fledgling television commentator, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s former chief justice says her biggest problem is reading cues `` with emotion and feeling, after you've learned to be more reserved and also to be less expressive as a jurist.'' She's also editing a book of essays, `` A Sense of Justice,'' working on a second, more autobiographical book, and preparing for a modest return to the legal profession as a part-time mediator. One subject Bird will not discuss is the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ the old liberal court, cast out when she and Justices <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynoso </PERSON> were defeated in a bitter 1986 campaign, or the current court that has been busy narrowing or undoing its predecessor's work. `` I am not going to use my -LRB- television -RRB- position as an opportunity to redo the election of 1986,'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, 51, said in an interview. `` I said from the very beginning that I was placed under a microscope and allowed no breathing room when I was placed on the court. I would not do that to anybody else. For over a year I have not made any comments on the new court. I'd never put anybody through what I went through.'' Her second book will be `` a historical analysis of what took place and why'' in the election, she said, but added, `` I'd like to see some years pass before that is published.'' A public defender, law professor and state cabinet officer before her appointment in 1977, <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> is resuming her legal career by joining a <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, firm, <ORGANIZATION> Dispute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, that will negotiate out-of-court agreements in business and labor-management disputes. Other mediators will include former court colleagues <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON>, now a law professor, and <PERSON> Reynoso </PERSON>, a Sacramento-based lawyer. In February, she ended a year of virtual public invisibility by becoming a twice-a-week commentator on evening news programs on <ORGANIZATION> KGO-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Advertised in advance by <ORGANIZATION> KABC </ORGANIZATION> as `` the most controversial woman in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> was portrayed by both stations as a liberal counterpart to <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Herschensohn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate who appears on two other days. But while a typical recent <PERSON> Herschensohn </PERSON> commentary found numerous similarities between the Democratic and communist platforms on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> has been far less partisan. Her topics have sometimes been provocative _ the power of the press, the destruction of rain forests, the World War II internment of Japanese-Americans. But her conclusions have generally been mild _ the press should be aware of its influence, people should `` treat the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> with the respect it deserves,'' the internment must never happen again. <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s tribute to the Japanese-Americans in her first show, in the form of a poem she had written and recited publicly several years earlier, got some critical catcalls. `` A Rose in prose would be much sweeter,'' declared TV critic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, who also advised her to try `` less-safe topics.'' But recently, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' TV columnist, described her commentaries as `` forceful, thoughtful and eloquent'' and said she was offering viewers `` her version of the big picture.'' `` Rather than comment so much on political issues and tell people how to think about them, I'd rather comment on more of the human condition,'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said. `` I just am not a rabid person who believes there's one way to look at things.'' That self-assessment seems to fit her television presence. But it might shock anyone whose impressions of Bird were formed in the 1986 election, when she was portrayed by opponents as a rigid, ideologically driven opponent of the death penalty, law and order, and judicial restraint. An overwhelming majority of viewer responses were negative at first, but now include nearly an equal amount of praise. Many comments have focused on who Bird was rather than on what she has said. One writer from <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> promised to stop watching <ORGANIZATION> KGO-TV </ORGANIZATION> if it continued to show `` THAT creature who was the friend of criminals.'' A <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> resident cited the death penalty, a subject Bird has not mentioned on the air. `` The response has been tremendous, both positive and negative,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crofoot </PERSON>, news director of <ORGANIZATION> KABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's good TV, that there's something to react to. Bird gets little editing on her two-minute scripts, but plenty of coaching on her television delivery. She is `` tentative right now'' but writes well and learns fast, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinnick </PERSON>, the assistant news director in charge of the 6 o'clock news at <ORGANIZATION> KGO-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` She's fun to have around a newsroom.'' The job has given the former chief justice a better understanding of the reporters who used to cover her. `` With deadlines and one-day stories,'' she said, `` it presents enormous problems in trying to give depth and full coverage, where everybody wants to know at the moment what the headline is.''

<BYLINE>Did You Pay The Cleaning Woman's Social Security?
^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you employ a cleaning person on a regular basis you must deduct Social Security taxes of 7.51 percent from the paycheck and, in addition, contribute a like amount as the employee's portion of the tax. This is one of the touchiest areas of American tax policy. Many employers of household help are ignorant of their obligations. Many domestics are equally unaware. And in many instances, either side elects to ignore the obligations. But those obligations, and others, are very real. They could lead to fines. They could lead to more costly problems if an ex-employee sues to reclaim benefits that should have been paid, but were not, over a period of years. It is a growing challenge to families, since many are able to exist only by having two breadwinners, each working at a fulltime job and therefore unable to handle household chores without the help of a domestic. Since there is already enough confusion about the obligations of those who employ domestics, a concerned household should describe its specific situation and accept guidance from an accountant or tax authority. The key word is `` employee.'' A young person who rakes your lawn once a year is n't an employee. But a domestic who cleans your house once a week is almost certainly an employee for whom you must pay taxes. Specialists at <ORGANIZATION> Spicer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Oppenheim </PERSON>, an accounting and tax firm, define a domestic as someone who performs service in or about a private home, including housekeepers, maids, cooks and babysitters. Payments made for the performance of such services are generally subject to the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or Social Security. An exclusion exists, says the accounting firm, for all payments under $ 50 made to an individual for occasional domestic help during a calendar quarter. Also excluded are payments in the form of lodging or meals. Otherwise, you might be liable _ and, again, it is wise to check with an accountant or tax adviser about your specific case _ for deducting your employee's portion of FICA and adding in the employer's identical FICA payment. Your tax responsibilities might not end there either. You might also be responsible for collecting both federal and state unemployment taxes. Wages paid for domestic service are subject to federal unemployment tax, says the firm, if cash paid to a performer of domestic service totals $ 1,000 or more in any quarter of a taxable year, or in a preceding taxable year. The maximum tax rate is 6.2 percent of the first $ 7,000 in wages. For state unemployment tax purposes, each state establishes its own quarterly requirements. But, whatever is paid to the state may earn a credit deductable from the federal tax. Almost needless to say, one reason many households ignore these tax laws is that they have more paperwork than time in which to do it, and more legal and financial complications than they feel competent to contend with. There is a way out of this one if you hire domestic help through an agency in the business of furnishing the actual services. Then, the agency is viewed as the employer responsible for all taxes. For the agency to qualify, and for you to be relieved of taxes, the agency must claim to be in the business of providing domestic services. It must fix compensation levels. Its income must be derived from its employee's income. By that definition, a company listed with the state as an agency that merely furnishes domestic workers to prospective employers for a fee _ that is, an employment agency _ does n't meet the requirements. Final advisory: Check with a tax authority or an accountant about your specific situation.

 The gullible among us believed that actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> died in the wreckage of his low-slung Porsche Spyder on a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> highway 33 years ago, but readers of Private Lives magazine were not fooled. `` He did n't die. He lives on, maybe right next door to YOU. And someday soon perhaps <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, in his own way and in his own good time, will once more come back and face the world that waits for him,'' the magazine suggested at the time. Private Lives was not alone among the exploitation magazines in suggesting in the weeks and months after <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s accident on Sept. 30, 1955 that the 24-year-old actor was alive. `` I think people wanted to believe that <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was alive,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Betrock </PERSON>, editor of `` The Best of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> in the Scandal Magazines, 1955-58,'' a collection of <LOCATION> Jamesmania </LOCATION> from such magazines as Whisper, On the QT, Anything Goes, Hush-Hush and Uncensored. `` I think this happens whenever someone with a fairly rabid following dies at an early age,'' <PERSON> Betrock </PERSON> said. `` Remember, after the assassination, there were those who believed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was brain-damaged and living in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, something that was n't too supported by facts. <PERSON> Betrock </PERSON> has reproduced the pages of the scandal magazines in full, along with ads for shrunken heads `` molded of virgin rubber'' and photographs of a woman named Lolita: `` If you like'em BUXOM, maybe you'll like my photos.'' The articles are also accompanied by many pictures of <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, the wreck and shapely starlets such as <PERSON> Pier </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Andress </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who were linked romantically with the star of `` Rebel Without a Cause'' and `` East of Eden.'' The actor's death in the crash on old state Highway 466 transformed him from a movie actor on the brink of stardom to the patron saint of young American rebels. His portrayals of vulnerable and moody young men who openly expressed fear and pain became standards for a generation. His mystique has endured. Rock songs such as the Eagle's `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Essex </PERSON>'s `` Rock On'' evoke his name The movie `` 9-30-55'' studied the reactions of contemporary fans to <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s death. A Broadway play, `` Come Back to the Five and Dime, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>,'' took aim at the hopeless nostalgia created by some fans. Some magazines knocked the `` Dean is not dead'' stories. Lowdown magazine reported that the deceased <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> received 8,000 love letters a month. `` This is gruesome mental illness of the unhealthiest order,'' wrote the editor. To prove the point, <PERSON> Lowdown </PERSON> printed a collection of letters. `` My sweet darling: When night falls and my stupid fat husband snores at my side, I hold you closely in my arms. I know you are not dead. You are disfigured and ashamed to show your face,'' writes one woman, who promises to leave her husband and five children and shower <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> with her $ 4,500 fortune. The scandal magazines covered every angle. On the QT asked, `` Did <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> leave a son? A persistent story coming out of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> claims that the teen idol fathered a carhop's baby shortly before he died.'' Did he commit suicide? Did black magic woven by ex-girlfriend <PERSON> Myla </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurmi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> TV personality also known as Vampira, have anything to do with the wreck? Did Dean steal an Oscar from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>? These questions are posed and authoritative answers are posited. A whole slew of articles purport to be the accounts, first-person and otherwise, of <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s secret friend, fiancee or wife. Most of them are pictured wearing few clothes. `` He told her, ` You know, in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> I see the most glamorous girls in the world. Expensive faces and bodies. But you're wholesome and like a good piece of bread to a hungry man You're like sweet well water to a thirsty man. That's the way he always spoke to <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON>,'' Lowdown reported. <PERSON> Betrock </PERSON>, who previously edited `` The I Was a Teen-Age Juvenile Delinquent Rock' n' Roll Horror Beach Party Movie Book,'' does not take all of this very seriously. The book's cover promises that its contents are `` Exclusive! Amazing! Fully Illustrated! Possibly True!'' But <PERSON> Betrock </PERSON> says the sordidness of the Dean stories makes an important point about a time that is often portrayed as an era of sweetness and naivete. `` I've always been interested in the darker side of popular culture,'' the 37-year-old record producer and editor said. `` The 1950s are often described in terms of <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and hula-hoops, but there was a whole undercurrent, the underbelly of Americana.''

<HEAD>Theater Group Gives Former Prisoners Chance to Make Clean Break</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> remembers the 2,022 bricks in her tiny cell. Sue <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> can still hear the clink of locks and keys. The sights and sounds of prison are vivid years later. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON>, both jailed on drug charges, do n't forget. Through an unusual theater group called Clean Break, they and other female ex-offenders are leaving their experiences behind by putting them on the stage. Begun nine years ago in a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prison, Clean Break has grown into a theater group which has toured in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, performed on the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage and produced more than a dozen plays. For the women, it's a chance to perform, to produce plays about the traumas of lives that led to jail sentences and, most of all, an opportunity to speak out about an experience many others try to hide. `` One of the most important things women ca n't do when they come out of prison is articulate their experience,'' says <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>, who helps run a reform group called Women in Prison and wrote one Clean Break play. Prison `` floats around in the back of your head,'' she says. `` If people can articulate crime it puts it behind you, and Clean Break makes a unique contribution. `` Apart from that, it's great fun,'' adds <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>, who served three years for check fraud. `` It's not everyone sitting around thinking, ` God, I'm a victim.''' Still, prison life is not the stuff of comedy. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has only 1,755 women in jail, out of a total prison population of nearly 49,000 cramped into an overcrowded prison network. But women prisoners are disciplined twice as often as men, are punished more often for violence and injure themselves more often than men, studies by the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders -LRB- NACRO -RRB- show. `` Women's prisons have never really been considered; they're run like men's prisons but with women in them,'' says <ORGANIZATION> NACRO </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>. `` The main question is why are they there,'' she says. `` It's terribly expensive, it's so destructive, it's such a waste This is true for men but more true for women.'' <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, who co-founded Clean Break in 1979 with a fellow inmate, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holborough </PERSON>, at a low-security prison, says leaving jail does n't mean the problems end. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Holborough </PERSON>, with the support of a liberal warden at Askhams Grange prison, expanded the annual Christmas show into a theater workshop, then a troupe. With a 21-strong group, they became the first British prisoners to perform outside jail, presenting a play in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>. Of the group, only <PERSON> Holborough </PERSON> had had any prior experience in the theater. `` It was an absolutely freeing activity from the bordom and general uselessness of prison,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. Now, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> works mainly with Creative and Supportive Trust -LRB- CAST -RRB-, a group for ex-offenders that shares Clean Break's drafty basement rooms in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and is closely allied with the theater group. Most productions have small casts and a barren set, and Clean Break can afford only one annual tour of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> fringe theaters. However, the actresses have union cards and salaries, and the group, which numbers about 30 permanent members, has expanded its activities. With its first public grant in 1986, Clean Break took <PERSON> Holborough </PERSON>'s play `` The Sin Eaters'' on an American tour including stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> prison and a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> women's festival. It has also toured in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. The group has performed at psychiatric hospitals, drug and alcohol rehabiliation centers and detention centers, opened its ranks to former inmates and sought the help of several professional actresses. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> actress who worked on `` The Sin Eaters,'' has for more than a year led writing workshops with therapist <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Last year, she combined a cast of RSC and Clean Break actresses in performing a collection of writings from both former and current prisoners called `` Voices From Prison'' at the Barbican, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage of the RSC. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also recently directed the latest production affiliated with Clean Break, 27-year-old <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s passionate account of how the therapy she demanded in prison helped her accept her heritage as a Maori, the indigenous minority of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. As Clean Break enters its ninth year, those involved question whether its main role is theatrical or therapeutic. Still, for many, Clean Break remains a dramatic help. `` It's a refuge,'' says <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON>. `` It was real therapy.''

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Delain </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Choteau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, became pregnant last year, she called her local doctor _ and learned he'd dropped obstetrical services to save on spiraling malpractice insurance costs. He was the last doctor delivering babies in the town of 1,700, so Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> had no choice but to look for a doctor in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, a 100-mile round trip. Even there, she found few doctors taking new patients. `` I had to wait three months before I could see one.'' But nine days before her first appointment, her baby was born at home, three months premature. The 2-pound, 15-ounce girl was taken in the Jan. 4 cold to the <LOCATION> Choteau </LOCATION> hospital, airlifted to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and later transferred to a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital, where she remains while her lungs develop further. Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> is one of many women affected by a national shift by doctors abandoning obstetrical services, many citing malpractice costs. For women in large metropolitan areas it's an inconvenience; in the country it can mean life or death. `` It happens in cities, but when it happens in cities, there are plenty of alternatives around. When it happens in rural areas, already there are n't very many doctors providing that care,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said there have been informal discussions in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the possible use of special pools of doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to assist hard-hit areas. `` Somebody's going to have to do something pretty soon, or we're going to end up having to rebuild those systems of care out there,'' he said `` We're concerned that ... we'll end up with higher infant mortality.'' A survey last year by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> found that just over half of its members who delivered babies had stopped doing so, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the organization's general counsel. One-third of those who quit blamed malpractice insurance costs. `` We're very concerned,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` The whole concept of a family doctor is to take care of the whole family. The big area of concern is in some of these isolated areas.'' Not everyone agrees malpractice coverage is the villain, and yet the national average annual premium for doctors delivering babies has risen from $ 10,946 in 1982 to $ 37,015 now, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists. Premiums average $ 52,000 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. She said about 12 percent of OB-GYNs each year stop doing deliveries, and that the age at which they stop is getting lower. Mirroring the national trends is <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. At least 60 of the approximately 250 doctors delivering babies in the state three years ago have quit that service, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. The vast expanse of rural <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> has never enjoyed an abundance of physicians. Now, there is too often a disheartening search for medical care that is basic yet unattainable. In <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, on the north central plains, only a part-time obstetrician remains. Women travel 90 miles to <PERSON> Havre </PERSON> or 70 miles to <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> to see a doctor who delivers babies. In <LOCATION> Thompson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, in the western mountains, no doctors do so. The journey is 100 miles to <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION> or 90 miles to <LOCATION> Sandpoint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> doctors say they are victims as well, paying soaring rates despite the fact that none has been hit by a fabled multimillion-dollar verdict. Insurance executives say they've been forced to increase rates not only to cover the higher and more frequent settlements in malpractic suits, but also to build up reserves in anticipation of future damages. But doctors pay the tab despite flawless records. Four years ago, Dr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sidney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, paid about $ 7,000 for a malpractice insurance policy that covered claims made at any time for treatment he performed that year. This year, he faced a $ 19,500 insurance premium that would cover him only for claims brought by the end of the year. If he quit the practice, he would have to pay an additional $ 36,000 to cover any claims brought in the future. In 12 years of practice, <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> has never been sued for malpractice in connection with a delivery. Such cases are rare in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, in fact. But malpractice claims and payouts for obstetrical cases have been increasing here. And insurers point to those increases to justify their rates. `` Obstetrics are our loss leader without question,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oslowski </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which insures about 200 doctors in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` It's probably damn near everyone's loss leader.'' About 15 percent of the malpractice claims in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in the last five years have been obstetric cases, but <PERSON> Oslowski </PERSON> said such cases accounted for 25 percent to 50 percent of insurance losses. Precise figures on losses in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> obstetrical cases are not readily available. But insurers say it is the fear of huge verdicts that not only forces them to charge higher premiums, but also to settle malpractice claims out of court frequently. Figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> show that since 1982, actual payments to malpractice claimants in the state rose steadily from $ 1 million that year to a high of $ 3.8 million in 1985. They dropped to $ 3.3 million in 1986. Doctors and their insurers want to deal with the problem by altering the legal system that resolves torts, or wrongful acts, such as medical malpractice. They say if tort reform is enacted to make the system more predictable, insurance rates will stabilize or drop. An advisory council appointed by <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> is studying the issue and most likely will recommend tort-reform measures to the 1989 Legislature. But others question whether the rate increases are justified and whether reforming the system will really solve the problem of costly insurance or doctors quitting obstetrical services. Dr. <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said many physicians stop delivering babies because of the inconvenience of being on call at all hours. `` It's easy to blame everything on the malpractice insurance crisis, but it ai n't so,'' he said. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Englund </PERSON>, an attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, added, `` Everyone has looked at -LRB- the problem -RRB- only in terms of tort reform. That may result in lowering of insurance rates for doctors ... But it certainly does n't solve the whole problem of the availability of health care in rural communities.'' That problem may not be solved until lawmakers feel the pressure from women who need medical care and ca n't find it, said Plains physician <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lulack </PERSON>. `` If you took a thousand pregnant women and had them sit on the Capitol steps, we'd have this problem solved in a minute,'' said <PERSON> Lulack </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> gets paid federal tax dollars to serve the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people as chief naturalist for Rocky Mountain National Park. He helps the 2.7 million citizen bosses who visit each year to understand the 414 square miles of national patrimony located 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. It's <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>'s job to tell us what it all means: What are those funny looking birds? Will this mushroom kill me if I eat it? What time do the rangers turn off the waterfalls? His is a five-page, single-spaced job description. He supervises two visitor centers, two museums, four amphitheaters, two information booths, a 2,000-volume library and an outpouring of new books and pamphlets; oversees six park employees, more than 30 seasonal workers and 50 volunteers, and administers an annual budget of $ 400,000. He is park spokesman for good news, such as international wilderness conferences, and bad news, such as people falling off mountains. A 25-year veteran of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, he earns $ 43,891 annually and lives with his wife, <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON>, a pianist and caterer, and their two teen-age children, in a government-owned house five minutes' walk from his office. His burning ambition is to return to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, ideally as a park superintendent. Assigned for five years to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Volcanoes National Park, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> says: `` I left my heart there. It's the first place on Earth that really sang to me.'' But the return will have to wait. In mid-May, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> begins work as chief of interpretation for the park service's <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> region. He'll be based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, a beautiful place, even if not his paradise. If <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> did n't exist, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> would invent him. At 46, he reports for work dressed like the Boy Scout he once was, yet often spends his days immersed in cosmic dilemmas such as the future of the ozone layer. He is an acrophobic who tries, and fails, to overcome his fear of heights by climbing mountains. A painter of tropical scenes, a wearer of Hawaiian shirts, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> lives in a landlocked alpine valley where winter lasts seven months. He describes himself as a diffident man, yet he boldly creates five-year plans for his department. Tall and gangly, with a monk's fringe of hair, he is a solitary outdoorsman but seizes every opportunity to attend grand opera with crowds Growing up in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> decided he wanted to spend his adulthood in the outdoors. So, straight out of <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1963, he joined the park service as a naturalist at Crater Lake National Park. There were n't many interpreters back then. `` Rangers were hugging trees or working with three spine sticklebacks -LRB- an ugly little fish -RRB-. They were n't big on people or communications skills.'' Today hundreds of workers on the federal payroll do nothing but explain the nation's parks to its people. `` What I try to do is get people to realize a park is not protected by boundaries on paper and a handful of rangers,'' <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> said. `` But we ca n't go out and say, ` YOU MUST SAVE THIS NATIONAL PARK!' `` We must lay out information and let people make up their own minds. In the long run, parks are protected by the peer attitudes of society.'' <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> believes one of the best ways to educate Americans about their natural treasures is through art. That notion, and an old log cabin, inspired him to create Rocky Mountain National Park's artist-in-residence program in 1984 The cabin, once owned by the late <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> newspaper editor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, has a breathtaking view of 14,255-foot Long's Peak Every summer <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> selects `` creators and communicators'' to spend from one to three weeks in the cabin, doing their own thing. The park provides housing and firewood, guests provide groceries. `` <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> broke through the inertia of ` This is the way we've always done it' and came up with a great idea,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON>, chief of the park service's <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region interpretation office in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON> attributed the program's success to <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>'s enthusiasm _ he raised money for the restoration and contributed his own elbow grease _ but added, `` There are quite a lot of those folks in government.'' Participating last summer were four journalists, three artists, two composers, a photographer, a writer and an actor. `` Artists need time to goof around, and <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> understands that,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pianist and composer who stayed in the cabin after he was commissioned to create a score for a park service film. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> taped wildlife, water and wind sounds to help him write a piano composition. He also practiced daily on the piano <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> moved into the house for his tenure. `` The cabin was offered with no strings attached. The guy was genuinely offering an experience to us to see what we would do with it,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` At first it seemed too good to be true, but I learned that <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> is a truly gentle man who has a very sincere respect for artists.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> plans to return to the park later this year to premier his musical work. `` This is the best thing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has ever done for me personally,'' the pianist said, speaking of the opportunity <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>'s program presented `` I feel I've been given a great gift.'' Art, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> says, has helped change Americans' perception of their land _ `` from fear and loathing of wilderness to embracing and positively administering it.'' <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> writes magazine articles and a column in the local newspaper. In one recent piece, he gently warned readers about world overpopulation and dwindling natural resources, and cautioned of a growing scarcity for future generations. He wished them freedom from the regimentation of overcrowding, access to beauty in nature, clean air and water, and the opportunity to achieve their potential. `` Above all,'' he concluded, `` I want them to know of their history and their responsibility, for in their action is the future of their lives.''

 Sometimes its hard to get from <LOCATION> Frogfuzz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> over to <ORGANIZATION> Blitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where the courthouse is. Or up to <LOCATION> Wrathgrape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> has the family in for Sunday dinner now and then. Most often rural people who are too poor or infirm to drive a car have to find a friend or relative to take them around. You do n't trot or teeter down to the corner to catch a bus or train because there are n't any. And sometimes people who live in the countryside, in the thousands of small towns and hamlets that make up rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, simply stay home when they're lonely or really should see a doctor. Railroad whistle-stop passenger service, the `` local'' or milk train of yesteryear, has long passed into history. Stagecoaches mostly gave way to buses by World War I, and even the buses are now becoming hard to find. `` Increasingly, if one lives in a rural community, efficient bus service may be only a distant memory, nor may rail or air service be available,'' says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. That's why <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> are joining with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to discuss a solution to rural transportation problems. Two regional meetings will be held this spring, in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, April 20-22, and in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, May 18-20. A national conference will be held in August in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stommes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> said the government's major financial aid involves the `` Section 18'' funds provided states by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- DOT -RRB- under the Urban Mass Transportation Act. The money has totaled around $ 75 million annually and is apportioned to states under a formula to help improve passenger transportation systems available to rural people. No increase in federal money is being talked about at this point, Ms. <PERSON> Stommes </PERSON> said in an interview. Instead, she said, the conferences will be focusing on `` coordinating the resources that are out there and trying to bring together the private and public sectors.'' It's sort of a hodge-podge of programs right now. States are contributing to rural transportation programs, along with the federal government. Local transportation providers, mostly non-profit groups, often have authority to operated within a single county or a certain multi-county region. To some extent, these contract with human services agencies to provide specialized transportation, to health facilities, for example. But in order to qualify for Section 18 funds, general public transportation must also be provided. `` One of the things that we're trying to encourage ... is the coordination of schedules between these providers and the intercity carriers,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stommes </PERSON> said. `` That is not happening in a great many places.'' But there are exceptions, she said. For example, `` Greyound is establishing what they call their rural connector program, in which local or non-profit providers are feeding their passengers into the intercity network,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stommes </PERSON> said. Improving rural transportation is not a new or novel idea. It has been the goal of countless community efforts since Americans started heading West. Any small-town <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> worth its salt has had a plan, prospectus or lobbying effort on behalf of gaining or keeping its railroad service, bus station or airport. Much work already has been done at the federal level. In the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, a White House Rural Development Initiatives project included `` ways to overcome isolation by improving transportation in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> in 1979 took the lead with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for the Transportation Disadvantaged in turning out a handbook, Rural Rides, for starting and operating a rural public transportation system. A point made by the 1979 handbook is the relatively scant amount of federal money available for rural transportation: although nearly 30 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population lives in rural areas, only about 1 percent of the federal money spent on public transportation goes to rural needs. The handbook, although dated in many ways, sounded a call for coordinating the fragmented transportation services that did exist _ exactly what Ms. <PERSON> Stommes </PERSON> said is one of the priorities of the 1988 effort. `` Coordination is good for the taxpayers and contributors who foot the ultimate bill because waste, inefficiency and duplication of effort should be eliminated,'' the handbook said. `` And it's good for everybody in the participating town, county or area because the savings can be passed on to the public in the form of increased transportation services.

<HEAD>Britain Baffled by Deaths of 10 Scientists Involved in Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Since August 1986, 10 British scientists, all with some connection to security projects or establishments, have died in unusual circumstances. There is no evidence _ or at least evidence that has been disclosed _ of a direct link, or a cloak-and-dagger conspiracy, but the deaths have baffled coroners, the widows, politicians and others who can not believe it is merely a coincidence. Opposition lawmakers have called without success for a government investigation into the so-called `` Mystery of the Dead Scientists.'' The authorities deny there is any mystery. `` Is it simply overwork, or is there something more sinister afoot?'' asked <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> after the latest death _ that of a computer engineer working on guided missile research; he was found dead March 25 in a fume-filled car. `` It is very alarming,'' said <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>. `` What is the link between all these?'' The government acknowledges the string of unexplained deaths is odd, but says investigations have been left to the police. Computer News, a respected industry periodical, has conducted an investigation and plans to release a detailed report shortly. What does link the scientists, other than their connection to the sometimes murky world of defense or security work? _ All 10 victims were men _ Four were in their early 20s _ All died in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, some far from their homes _ Five worked for <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> or its related companies Marconi is an electronics subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading defense contractor not related to the American company. _ Four worked for <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government or military installations Most of the deaths resemble suicides, although only two have been ruled as such so by inquests. In several cases the families said the scientists suffered from nothing more than overwork. The mystery began Aug. 5, 1986, when <PERSON> Vimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dajibhai </PERSON>, 24, was found dead in the gorge below <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Suicide was suspected, but a coroner's inquest reached no decision about the cause of death. In the next eight months, until April 1987, there seven more deaths, then a lull until one each this February and March. <PERSON> Dajibhai </PERSON> was a junior engineer checking torpedo guidance systems for <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. No one has determined what he was doing in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, 105 miles away. Three months after <PERSON> Dajibhai </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Ashhad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, a computer systems analyst working on a defense project for another <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> unit near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, died in a park near <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>. An inquest ruled that <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, 26, killed himself by tying a rope to a tree, looping the other end around his neck and then driving off in his car at high speed. Coroner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> called it suicide, but he, too, wondered why it happened in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>. In January 1987, computer designer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> was found dead in his home east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The circumstances were never explained, but a jury ruled it was accidental death during sexual experimentation. <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, 37, had previously worked on <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> contracts. Also that month, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittam </PERSON>, a 52-year-old computer expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armaments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Establishment </ORGANIZATION>, was found dead in his garage with his car engine running. <PERSON> Brittam </PERSON> previously worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciene </ORGANIZATION>. A month later, a senior metallurgy lecturer at the college, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peapell </PERSON>, was found dead under his car with the engine running. The government said <PERSON> Peapell </PERSON>, 46, was working on an unclassified project studying recent trends in beryllium in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In March 1987, computer expert <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> drove his car, its trunk loaded with tanks of gasoline, into a vacant restaurant and was burned to death. Sands, 37, worked for Easams, a <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> associate, on a tender for an air defense systems contract. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, called for a government investigation following Sands' death. He wrote in a letter to the Conservative government: `` I do not wish to be accused of inventing plots more suited to a TV thriller than real life, but I think the circumstances of these ... cases stretch the possibility of mere coincidence too far.'' In April 1987 two more scientists were found dead. One was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, 25, a computer specialist at a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> weapons-testing base, who an inquest ruled committed suicide by placing a plastic bag over his head. The other was a Marconi scientist, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 46, who an inquest determined died of a drug overdose. <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> was working on computer software for the Tornado fighter plane and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had worked on a night vision project for the British army. The mysterious deaths stopped until this past Feb. 2, when police found the body of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 23-year-old junior scientist, halfway down a cliff. Police said they found a note in his car in a cliff-top park but refused to say what was in the note. They have declined to speculate on the cause of his death. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> worked for the ultra-secret <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingdom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harwell </LOCATION>. No one has determined why he was at Land's End, 150 miles from <PERSON> Harwell </PERSON> Finally, on March 25, another Marconi employee, 52-year-old <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, was found dead in his fume-filled car in <LOCATION> Harpender </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He was a computer engineer working on guided missile research at Marconi headquarters.

 <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> has trouble recreating the jumbled events of April 10, 1963, the night she was told the USS Thresher, a nuclear submarine carrying her husband and 128 other men, had not resurfaced from a dive 220 miles off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast. She is n't quite sure who came to her home or what they said. She thinks friends helped put her five children to bed and turned away reporters clamoring for reaction. She thinks a <ORGANIZATION> Portsmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> chaplain told her he would be there if she needed him. There is one thing, however, <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> did remember as she reflected last week on Sunday's 25th anniversary of the nation's worst submarine disaster: `` I just did n't think that they would n't come up again But the submarine, powerless with a crippled nuclear reactor, never had a chance, sinking deeper and deeper in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> until fierce water pressure crushed its hull and killed all aboard. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Axene </PERSON>, Thresher's commanding officer until three months earlier, was returning to <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> when he heard on the radio a submarine was missing. He drove immediately to the shipyard, which <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON> had left two days earlier. After midnight, <PERSON> Axene </PERSON> began calling family members, many of whom were close friends and had faith in the 278-foot submarine that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said could `` dive deeper, move faster and carry more weapons than any other submarine in the fleet.'' `` It was a great ship and it had a great crew,'' he said. `` When I was reassigned, I fought to stay on it.'' <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON> had three years of success when it left for tests the morning of April 8. Accompanied by the submarine tender <PERSON> Skylark </PERSON>, Thresher's 112 military personnel and 17 civilian technicians were looking for minor glitches in the machinery after a routine overhaul. But the problems were more severe than anyone suspected. At 9:02 a.m. on April 10, the Skylark received a message from Thresher, 1,000 feet below the surface: `` Experiencing minor difficulties.'' Garbled radio messages followed saying <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON> was `` exceeding test depth,'' then `` attempting to blow,'' a naval term for resurfacing. At 9:17, Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, listening to <PERSON> Skylark </PERSON>'s radio, `` heard the sounds of a ship breaking up _ a dull, muted roar.'' Then silence. <PERSON> Skylark </PERSON> radioed that <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON> was missing. `` It was a terrible experience, a terrible thing,'' Axene, now retired and living in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said of calling crew families. He plans to attend Sunday's memorial services for the first time in 24 years, but the memories are still too painful for his wife. Some crewmen's wives, like <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON>, did n't believe <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON> was lost and told reporters to print the good news when their husbands returned. <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> finally went to bed that night. `` I had three babies -LRB- and two other children -RRB- and they had to be taken care of, so you just go on,'' she said. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> told her the sub was lost, she told shipyard officials to leave her husband's car waiting at the pier. `` You would think that you would react immediately to something like this, but you do n't,'' she said. <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> was n't alone. Some speculated that crewmen might be alive, sustained by air bubbles trapped in the wreckage. Another sub detected what some believed were hull noises, prompting the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to declare the night after the tragedy that `` there is absolutely no possibility that there might be survivors.'' But the truth did n't register with <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> until days later when friends told her ships had spotted an oil slick _ the telltale sign of wreckage. `` I finally realized what was happening, and I went into orbit,'' she said. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> board of inquiry pieced together what went wrong. The board considered 120 witnesses, 225 exhibits and 1,700 pages of testimony before concluding problems probably started with a leak in the saltwater piping. The board said water had shorted out electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor, leaving Thresher powerless. `` The Thresher presumably blew main ballast, started to rise, then slowed and began to sink,'' Vice Adm. E.W. <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON> wrote in a 1964 analysis of the disaster. When the sub sank below its `` collapse depth,'' water pressure crushed the hull. In August 1964, a research submarine found and photographed the wreckage, about 1 -LCB- miles down. A witness described the ocean floor as resembling `` a huge automobile junkyard with big pieces of heavy metal all over the place.'' <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON>'s sole surviving crew member, who took leave just before the sub left because his wife had had an accident, said he still believes the submarine could have been saved. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON>'s reactor officer, said he might have been able to use the sub's momentum to prevent its plunge. He would have sacrificed the reactor to save the submarine, he said. After Thresher, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> developed a submarine safety program based on the board's findings. The program includes strict construction methods and testing for saltwater piping, more initial shallow-water sea trials and design improvements. `` My feeling is that progress is expensive and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has certainly learned from Thresher,'' <PERSON> McCoole </PERSON> said last week. `` It's a hard way to learn, however.'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, who was 4 when his father, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, perished, agreed. `` A lot of good came out of that sad day,'' said <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, who spent three years on a submarine himself and now is an instructor at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training center in <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> has read names of the dead at several Thresher services and helped plan this year's service, expected to be the largest since the tragedy. Despite the pain of growing up without his father, <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> said mourning is n't the main purpose of the service. `` I take the memorial service very seriously and it's a big deal to me every year,'' he said. `` But from my point of view, the Thresher incident and what impact it had on national defense is really why it's important. `` It made subs a lot safer. Many, many lives have been saved because those guys gave their lives.'' <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> will be at Sunday's service. After working years in a school lunch program and as a nurse, <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> decided in 1986 to honor her husband with a plaque in Arlington National Cemetery. `` I finally decided it was time to have our own service'' for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, she said. `` I felt that by then everyone would understand the situation.'' Aided by veterans benefits and Social Security, <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> has raised her family. This spring, her last child will graduate from college. `` You do what you have to, and the good Lord guides you,'' she said.

 A stronger dollar and weaker interest rates sparked Wall Street's second best day of 1988, with stock prices rising so strongly they triggered the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s self-imposed limits on one type of trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 64.16 points to 2,061.67 on Wednesday, its biggest gain since the widely-watched market barometer rose 76.42 points on Jan. 4, the year's first trading day. In Wednesday's only major economic report, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Big Three automakers reported that dealer sales incentives paid off with strong late-March and first-quarter sales increases. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, nearly three stocks rose in price for every one that declined as <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume rose to 189.76 million shares, from Tuesday's 135.29 million. By swinging more than 50 points, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> industrials triggered an <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> restriction on computerized program trading for the first time since the so-called `` collar'' was announced on Feb. 4. Program trading, a technique used to profit on price differences between stocks traded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and corresponding stock-index futures traded in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures markets, has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market and frightening investors. Analysts said Wednesday's gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar in foreign exchange, which in turn prompted a decline in long-term interest rates in the credit markets. The dollar moved higher, analysts said, on speculation the major industrial nations may be moving toward a fresh agreement to support the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. A meeting of the industrial powers is planned for next week. The dollar rose to 126.03 Japanese yen late in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 125.28 yen late Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond ended the session up nearly $ 10 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, slipped to 8.75 percent from 8.84 percent. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported more than 18 percent jumps in daily sales rates for the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the top seller, reported a nearly 10 percent rise.

 Hopes continue waning in the oil markets that an upcoming <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee meeting will result in actions to stabilize crude prices. In quiet trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, crude oil futures prices finished marginally higher while refined oil products were mixed. Contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, edged up 2 cents per barrel to $ 16.81. Other contract months gained between 1 cent and 3 cents. Among refined products, wholesale heating oil for May delivery rose 0.14 cent a gallon to 45.34 cents, while most longer-term months declined. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for May fell 0.22 cent a gallon to 48.42 cents, but longer-term contracts advanced. Crude prices failed to reach the $ 17-a-barrel level, which they had tumbled below Tuesday following reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' pricing committee would not recommend a full ministerial conference of the cartel at its April 9 meeting. The upcoming meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, earlier had incited hope that the 13-nation cartel would act aggressively to stabilize prices and enforce production limits to curb excessive supplies. `` The market is no longer expecting great shakes'' from the April 9 meeting, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an oil analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said prices were supported by the latest weekly statistics on the nation's oil supply and demand, which showed a jump in oil imports and a substantial drawdown of oil stocks from the previous week. The data, released late Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were construed as indicating continued robust demand for oil.

 Stock prices have jumped sharply in response to optimism over the outlook for inflation and interest rates, propelling the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its second biggest gain of the year. The Wednesday rise in the Dow was sharp enough to trigger a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> restriction on computerized program trading for the first time since the limit was announced Feb. 4. But stocks kept rising even after the restriction _ effective once the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> industrials moves more than 50 points up or down from the previous day's close _ kicked in late in the session. The Dow industrials finished 64.16 points higher at 2,061.67. It was the average's ninth-biggest gain ever and the largest since it rose 76.42 on Jan. 4. Nearly three issues rose for every one that fell among NYSE-listed issues. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> trading volume grew to 189.76 million shares from 135.29 million shares on Tuesday. Analysts said the market's rise was triggered by a news report from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that officials of the seven major industrial countries likely would agree on a plan to support the dollar in foreign exchange. A strong dollar would diminish inflationary pressure, which in turn could ease upward pressure on interest rates, analysts said. Recent expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would tighten credit and push interest rates higher had depressing stock market psychology, said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, a market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But some analysts were skeptical about how long the strong gains would last, given the market's recent volatility. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> program trading restrictions took effect after the Dow industrials passed the 50-point gain mark at about 3:19 p.m. EDT, a spokeswoman for the exchange said. Program trading is a technique used by big investors to profit on price differences between stocks and the corresponding stock-index futures. It has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market, frightening investors away and harming the securities industry.

 Crushing trading volume during last year's stock market crash has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to broaden the planned expansion of its trading systems, with a daily capability of 1 billion shares targeted by the end of 1989. `` At a time when many firms are cutting costs, we believe the securities industry needs to take action to insure the ability to handle high volume,'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Birnbaum </PERSON> said Wednesday. The exchange now can efficiently process the buying and selling of 200 million shares a day. It initially planned to broaden its capacity to 400 million shares a day this year, but increaesd that target following the October stock market crash. Volume exceeded 600 million shares on both Oct. 19 and 20, representing 200 million shares more than the system's current theoretical capacity. The exchange now expects to be able comfortably to handle daily volume of 600 million shares by June, according to its operations advisory committee, which is coordinating the upgrading of the securities industry's trading and communications systems. Last year trading volume averaged 197 million shares a day. Among additional measures the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> has taken to upgrade its systems capacity since the October market crash are: _ Increasing and restructuring the Designated Order Turnaround -LRB- DOT -RRB- System's memory for more efficient order processing _ Program changes to the limit order systems to reduce bottlenecks during peak volume periods A 50 percent capacity increase is targed for this month. _ Adding 20 printers to the trading floor, thereby increasing capacity by 20 percent, and increasing the number of electronic display books on the floor by 25 percent _ Replacing the automated pricing and reporting system Since 1982 the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> has spent more than $ 250 million upgrading its systems and technology. The exchange has budgeted another $ 200 million to be spent on improvements over the next five years.

 Growing confidence in the economy and plentiful buyer incentive offerings boosted domestic car and light truck sales in late March and the first quarter of 1988, according to manufacturers and industry analysts. Sales of domestically-manufactured cars in the 10 selling days of March 21-31 totaled 332,721, up from 282,358 in the nine selling days during the late-March period last year. Domestic sales for the quarter totaled 1,914,022, up from 1,666,748 a year earlier, according to manufacturers sales reports released Wednesday. Import car sales, reported monthly, totaled 255,867 for March, up from 237,677 in March 1987, and 700,572 for the quarter, up from 639,403 in first quarter 1987. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Certo </PERSON>, an automotive industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the sales figures indicated that buyer incentives offered during the month were very effective at drawing customers. `` Sales are robust for the month, continuing what was going on in January and February,'' <PERSON> Certo </PERSON> said. Buyers appear confident in a strong election-year economy and unworried about last October's stock slump, she said. `` Cash-allowance buyer incentive programs are in effect a temporary price cut and the buyers are reacting to the bargain prices,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vice president. <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> also said: `` The solid economic conditions of high employment and strong consumer confidence are a major part of their total purchase process.'' First-quarter sales of imported light trucks slid to 168,908 from 204,424 in the 1987 first-quarter, while domestic light truck sales jumped to 1,044,984 for the quarter, compared with 840,073 in the year-earlier quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> both reported more than 18 percent jumps in daily sales rates for the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the top seller, reported a 9.5 percent rise in its daily rate. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sold 159,728 domestically produced autos in the March 21-31 period, up from 136,082 in the 1987 late-March period. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> quarterly sales rose to 942,830 autos from 849,470 in first quarter 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold 93,590 domestic cars in the 10 days, up from 79,249, and 553,545 for the three months, up from 462,629.

<HEAD>Mexico Will Press Ahead With Efforts to Erase Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will continue pursuing efforts to pare its $ 100 billion foreign debt despite the limited success of its novel program to swap some loans for U.S.-backed bonds, according to the nation's chief debt negotiator. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON>, director of public credit for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told foreign reporters that the nation's debt outlook had improved dramatically since the beginning of the crisis in 1982. But, he said, `` the matter of the foreign debt continues being a matter of fundamental importance -LRB- and -RRB- great worry for Mexican authorities.'' `` It's obvious that today we have a situation drastically different -LRB- from 1982 -RRB-, and obviously from a positive point of view,'' he said. `` The situation is much better, it is more comfortable,'' he said. But foreign debt remains a problem because of the hefty amount of interest <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> must pay its creditors. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> paid $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion in interest on its debt last year, second-highest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON> talked to foreign reporters late Tuesday on the condition that his remarks not be released as a matter of `` courtesy'' before he spoke to a panel of the Mexican legislature on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials were pleased with the concept of the program to erase some of its foreign debt by exchanging old loans for special U.S.-backed bonds. But he acknowledged February's auction of the bonds had not lived up to expectations. The operation was `` smaller than what we had expected, certainly smaller than what we had wanted,'' <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON> said. The program involves exchanging some of the debt <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year-old bonds issued by the Mexican government. The bonds are backed by special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities and carry a higher interest rate than <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is paying on the old debt. During the Feb. 26 auction, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> received bids from 139 banks in 18 countries but rejected 45 percent of the bids. The bids that were accepted will result in retiring $ 3.66 billion in debt at an average discount of 69.77 cents on the dollar, offering $ 2.56 billion worth of bonds in exchange. That sale will reduce the Mexican debt by $ 1.1 billion, a small amount in comparison with the total oustanding credit. But the cancellation of debt will mean savings of $ 1.5 billion in interest charges over the next 20 years, the government said. <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON> said officials were pleased with the discount on the loans. Mexican debt has been selling for about 50 cents on the dollar in the secondary market. In his remarks to foreign reporters and the legislature, he emphasized <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s desire to erase some of its foreign debt, while capturing more new money to use in developing the economy. `` The balance is difficult to achieve and the final objective even more so: to reduce the burden of the debt without closing off to the country doors to possible support that will be required in the future,'' he said in remarks released by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Sales of Imported Cars in Japan Surge 41.1 Percent In Fiscal 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of imported cars in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> surged by 41.1 percent in the fiscal year ended in March to a record 104,340 units, partly because of the rising yen and government efforts to simplify inspection procedures, an industry group announced today. Import sales surpassed the previous record of 73,924 units in fiscal 1986, according to officials of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Automobile Importers-Association. German-made cars topped the list, accounting for 78,468 units of the total sales, followed by 7,541 British and 4,675 U.S.-manufactured cars. The group said that in March, overall import car sales rose 26.1 percent from a year earlier to 11,976 units, also a record. March marked the 51st consecutive month in which sales rose from the year-earlier levels, officials said. German-made cars accounted for 74 percent of the total import sales in March, they said. The group said the rise in import car sales, both in fiscal 1987 and in March, stemmed from lower interest rates on auto loans and the yen's sharp appreciation, which makes imported goods cheaper. They also said the government simplified inspection procedures as part of its attempt to bolster imports and cut the nation's large trade surplus, while foreign car makers stepped up marketing campaigns in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by establishing local subsidiaries

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Following Wednesday's Rally, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was higher in early European trading today, still boosted by a report that finance ministers of the seven major industrialized nations will set a floor for the American currency at a meeting next week. Gold prices were lower but steady following Wednesday's falls. Dealers said foreign exchange markets had calmed down considerably following the dollar's frantic rally Wednesday after the Japanese report that the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> would set a bottom rate for the dollar of 125 yen. Although traders said they doubted the group has set a specific minimum for the dollar, the market appeared to be reluctant to sell dollars before the meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next Wednesday. `` Until the Group of Seven meeting, it probably wo n't go any lower,'' one dealer at a European bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said. While the group may not have specific targets, one trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said, `` it is clearly the intention of the central banks, especially of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to maintain the dollar stable in order to avoid a negative impact on the stock market.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.67 yen to a closing 125.70 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted fractionally higher at 125.85 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6787 West German marks, up from 1.6700; 1.3890 Swiss francs, up from 1.3775; 5.6975 French francs, up from 5.6570; 1.88325 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8720; 1,244.50 Italian lire, up from 1,236.50; and 1.2445 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2401 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar also gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.8685 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.8790 late Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 446.60 a troy ounce and at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 446.25, both down from Wednesday's late bid of $ 449.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 446.40, down from $ 449.50 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 5.56 to close at a bid $ 447.65. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.45 a troy ounce, down from late Wednesday's $ 6.57.

<HEAD>Nikkei Index Hits All-Time High, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices surpassed their pre-crash best levels and reached an all-time high today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while the dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 195.82 points Wednesday, gained another 258.05 points, or 0.97 percent, closing the day at 26,769.22. The overnight surge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> helped release bullish sentiment pent up for several days because of concern over how Wall Street would fare if the dollar fell further or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates rose, traders said. The Nikkei average close today was more than 100 points above the previous high recorded just before the worldwide stock market crash last Oct. 14, when it closed at 26,646.43. `` Share prices rose almost across the board,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The key market barometers regaining their pre-crash levels indicated the strong fundamentals of the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, he said. Prominent among gainers were electricals and automobiles. Financials were also firm. Volume of the first section trade was a heavy 1.6 billion shares. Meanwhile, the dollar closed the day at 125.70, the day's high, up 0.67 yen from its close of 125.03 yen Wednesday. It had opened the day at 125.60 yen and ranged between 125.40 and 125.70 yen. `` Trading was mixed in dollar-buying and selling, but the market was generally quiet,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He attributed the quietness to participants sidestepping the market in advance of the meeting of seven major monetary nations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week.

 Millionaire industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, sentenced for tax fraud to create a $ 3 million project to aid the homeless, insists he wants to go ahead with the plan despite the objections of a federal prosecutor. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, 69, faced what could have been up to a 40-year prison term after pleading no contest to inflating that value of land donated to a college in order to deduct it from his tax return. Instead, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> financier was ordered to set up the $ 3 million project to aid the homeless and pay $ 4 million in back taxes, interest, fines and court costs. While the $ 4 million part of <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s sentence wo n't be changed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, who did not prosecute <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, has argued the sentence gives the appearance that the wealthy can buy their liberty. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said in his motion he was `` duty-bound to call to this court's attention the fact that this court does not have the power to order a criminal defendant to make charitable contributions as a condition of probation.'' At a hearing Wednesday, Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> required the 69-year-old <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to state under oath that he did not wish the sentence set aside and that he was going ahead with the plan `` freely and voluntarily.'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and a 10-member blue ribbon committee met Wednesday in <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>'s courtroom to discuss the first stage of the program, a study of the homeless in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Since February, I have been studying and learning about the problems of the homeless both nationally and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said in a brief statement. `` All the studies in the world will not help one homeless person. I will come to you with what will solve the problem.'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, must formally reply within 30 days to <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>'s motion, which was filed Monday, <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said. The initial study will include a six-part census of south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s homeless; an examination of subpopulations such as alcoholics, the mentally ill and families with children; and a review of how government policy affected the problem and what services are available to the homeless in each community. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said he did n't plan to take an active role in the committee's deliberations but suggested that the initial study not use more than $ 500,000 of <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s donation. Findings are scheduled to be available by May 16, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fike </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Barry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which was chosen by <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to administer the study because of its social work program. Sister <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Loughlin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Barry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, praised the tycoon's ideas and said she hoped that <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s donation would be the nucleus of a program that might grow to $ 300 million. `` He has a very fast mind,'' she said. `` He's creating solutions even before we give him all the data.''

<TEXT>
 Stock prices jumped on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange Thursday, boosted by the previous strong gains on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> markets. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 22.2 points, or 1.3 percent, at 1,767.0 at midday. Volume was 261.9 million shares, compared with 220.9 million shares at the same point Wednesday. Share prices were marked up as soon as trading started in reaction to the strong rises in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. All three markets were helped by an unconfirmed Japanese report that the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations' finance ministers would seek to maintain a floor for the dollar at around 125 yen at a meeting to be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday. However, banking shares were sharply lower after <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a major British bank, announced it would raise 921 million pounds, or $ 1.72 billion, by offering its shareholders the opportunity to buy one new <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> share at a substantial discount for every two they already own. But news of the issue had little effect on the market overall, which remained focused on the Wall Street and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> gain. Dealers said rumors of a large issue were circulating late on Wednesday, reducing the impact of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION>' announcement.

A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the link between the two exchanges will be the first cooperative effort between a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese exchange. `` The <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region is extremely important to the entire futures industry,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>, adding that the exchange plans to open an office in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> later this year. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grede </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said the two exchanges are n't discussing a trading link that would permit contracts to be bought at one exchange and sold at another Instead the two exchanges will work together in developing the contracts to make them more appealing to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and overseas traders. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> exchange will license use of its `` Topix'' composite index to the CBOT. Topix futures have yet to receive Japanese regulatory approval, but the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> could begin trading the index contract as soon as it is launched in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Taiwan's March Trade Surplus Lowest Since January 1983</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> registered a trade surplus of $ 163 million in March, the lowest monthly surplus in six years, the government reported Thursday. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the island's largest trading partner, totaled $ 298 million in March, down sharply from $ 1.27 billion a year earlier, the government said. The monthly surplus was down sharply from $ 994 million in February, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, Accounting and Statistics. Exports totaled $ 4.51 billion, up 10.9 percent from March last year, while imports amounted to $ 4.35 billion, up 67.6 percent, the report said. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s monthly surplus has not been that low since April 1982, when it was $ 60 million. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in January replaced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the country sending the most goods to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports reaching $ 1.3 billion in March, up 152 percent from a year earlier. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> equaled $ 1.6 billion, down 10.5 percent, the report said Trade officials attributed the surplus decline to tariff reductions on 3,500 items and the 39 percent appreciation of the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollar against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar since January 1986, which has made American products less expensive here. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has been under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to reduce its massive bilateral trade surplus, which totaled a record $ 16 billion last year, the third largest surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after those of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, its second largest trading partner, totaled $ 601 million in March, up 27 percent from the same month last year.

<HEAD>Mercantile Exchange Votes To Implement An S&amp;P Opening Limit of
Five Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Board of Governors of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to implement an opening limit of five points in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 futures contract, officials said. The opening limit was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last week and will be effective April 19. It isdesigned to coordinate any imbalance which may occur at the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The opening limit was one of a series of proposals the exchange made to the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> in early February designed to address concerns raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that investigated the stock market crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is the first exchange to implement daily price limits on its stock index contract. Traders and market users will be briefed on the opening limit before its implementation. The new rule specifies that there will be no trading at a price more than five index points above or below the previous day's settlement price If triggered on the opening, the five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of scheduled trading or until the contract trades off the five-point limit, whichever happens first. After 10 minutes or if the contract trades off the limit, the regular daily limit of 15 index points becomes effective.

He said <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> face a decision. `` I'm looking forward to sitting down with both of them,'' <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> told reporters during his tour of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> headquarters tower. He began meeting with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> executives, saying he hopes many of them will choose to stay with the company, which operates more than 650 stores nationwide and had $ 11.1 billion in sales last year. <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> has said the Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> will streamline <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, combining purchasing, marketing and other operations now done independently by <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s store groups. Some Allied executives will be relocated to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, but others will remain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> has said. <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON>, 46, a retailer of 17 years' experience, is president of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the retailer purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sold off many Allied divisions to pay off its debt in that purchase and analysts have said they expect <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> will do the same with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> repeated <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s intention to keep <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` crown jewel'' store groups: <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> He said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also plans to keep <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION>, a Los Angeles-based supermarket chain. <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> retailer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> beat out in the fight for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, completed an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> last week under which <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> will buy the Los Angeles-based <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s stores and the San Francisco-based <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> store <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has said it agreed to sell the Houston-based <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s store group and the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s store chain to <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>UAW Members Still Wrangling Over Chrysler Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members moved closer to wrapping up demands for mid-April <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> contract talks, but continued wrangling internally over whether to extend the contract's protections to some former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers. About 140 delegates from 49 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> local unions approved contract proposals Wednesday that closely mirror economic and job-protecting provisions in contracts signed last fall with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The union's main strategy in talks set to open April 18 is to return to uniform bargaining with the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers by imposing the Ford-GM pattern contract on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and by limiting the contract to two years so that all three contracts expire together in 1990. `` We've had a pattern settlement before us now for almost a year. ... It should not take a long time for us to put this together,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said of the coming negotiations after addressing the delegates. The strategy prevents the union from seeking to win <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers any significant improvement on the GM-Ford pattern in this year's talks But it will strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s bargaining power in 1990, when its members' jobs will be further threatened by as many as eight Japanese-owned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories capable of building up to 2.5 million vehicles a year. The decision against asking for pay raises breaking the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> pattern angered some <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bargainers. `` We're stuck with something that was negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, unit chairman of Local 573 of the Office and Clerical Workers, told The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not getting any raises, and the membership does n't want it.'' Like the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> contracts, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> proposals would give workers yearly bonuses equal to 3 percent of their annual wages, forbid plant closings and prevent layoffs for any reason except a drop in sales. But unlike the two earlier pacts, the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> proposal also would forbid sale of plants or operations during the life of the contract, an attempt to force <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to back further away from plans to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary. The council was scheduled to finish approving demands today and to vote on whether to include nearly 1,000 former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> workers at an engine and stamping plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, under the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract or to leave them to bargain for themselves, as they did before <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> last August.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has won a second federal court injunction blocking hostile suitors led by British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The scale comes down on the side of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wrote in issuing a preliminary injunction Wednesday preventing the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group from proceeding with its $ 1.7 billion tender offer before April 15. The Beazer group said today it would extend its $ 60-a-share offer, launched March 3, from its scheduled expiration at midnight today until midnight April 15. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> issued an injunction Monday blocking the hostile $ 60-a-share offer indefinitely on antitrust grounds. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> succeeded in overturning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ruling, his order immediately blocks the offer until April 15, when he intends to rule on <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' claims that the tender offer violates securities law. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 87 -LCB- cents to $ 55.37 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> last Friday rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group's request to invalidate <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' `` poison pill'' takeover defense, which greatly would increase the cost of a hostile takeover. It was not immediately clear how the hurdle raised by <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> will affect the tender offer from <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the takeover company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. BNS attorney <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishkin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> the investors were prepared to extend the tender offer _ scheduled to expire at midnight tonight _ until his ruling. BNS had contended that delays in closing the deal could jeopardize its financing. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> testified before <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> Wednesday that he expects the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> board eventually to reject as inadequate the $ 60 offer as it did <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier bids of $ 45 and $ 56 per share. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> board stated Tuesday it would take no position on the latest offer immediately due to the pending litigation and the company's ongoing attempts to seek alternatives to the hostile buyout. The 64-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> chairman said he expected someone to beat the $ 60-a-share offer, but `` I'm not sure I could hazard a guess as to when.'' <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> testified that the board was considering selling an interest in all or part of the company, which has operations in construction materials and services and chemicals. Management prefers to sell no more than 20 percent to 25 percent of its valued construction materials and services group, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has said it also was considering a recapitalization plan, or the sale of the entire company. `` Some management people have talked about a leveraged buyout,'' of the chemicals businesses _ which <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> has indicated he would sell if successful in his takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> _ although pollution cleanup obligations make that option less likely, <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> officially ended a year under bankruptcy court protection today, completing its epic legal fight with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> but facing continued pressure from dissident shareholders and takeover strategists. Under a reorganization plan approved March 23 by a federal bankruptcy court judge, the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based oil giant transferred $ 3 billion to a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> bank account in <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s name today. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> also will begin making another $ 2.6 billion in payments to its other creditors. The four wire transfers to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> began at 10:03 a.m. CST today and took 10 minutes to complete, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said. In exchange for the $ 3 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> will drop its claim to a $ 10.3 billion judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> that Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> was holding when <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors on last April 12. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said it took that action to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond while appealing the judgment awarded <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> by a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury in November 1985. The jury found <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had improperly interfered with a January 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> acquisition of part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, then bought all of <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> itself. Following <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON>'s approval of the plan _ worked out in December by the two companies and committees representing <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> creditors and shareholders _ <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> borrowed $ 2.7 billion from a consortium of banks The loan was to be repaid today once the $ 3 billion is deposited in <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s account at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said today that no company celebration was planned to mark the occasion, but he added he was glad to see the case finally end. `` It's obviously been a very protracted affair,'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. `` I think it is important that all the parties concerned move into the mainstream of what we really do best, and that's run our companies.'' The money <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> borrowed has been invested in short-term securities such as government securities and high-grade corporate bonds, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> borrowed the money before actually getting the cash so the company could invest it `` in an orderly manner.'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said he does not expect any immediate major investments by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our board really wants to take a look at all the options out there,'' he said. `` We've been looking at various opportunities. Our board will meet in early June to assess various possibilities.'' Officials of both companies have said they chose to settle the matter so they could get back to their businesses without the prospect of endless litigation. Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who holds 14.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and is its largest shareholder, last week filed an appeal of the reorganization plan objecting to certain financial conditions and provisions giving legal releases to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials. But <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> stressed he never opposed the plan as a whole. `` I'm glad they came out of bankruptcy, and did not want to stand in the way of that event,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> added that he thought it was `` wrong that shareholders were forced to give releases to those involved -LRB- in the Getty Oil acquisition -RRB- without having to vote on the releases separately.'' His objection _ joined by other shareholders _ has been that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was throwing away a chance to recoup some of its losses by suing the people who were responsible. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also opposed a default provision of a loan <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will use to help fund the reorganization. Under a provision of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with a consortium of about 25 banks providing up to $ 3 billion in credit, the loans would be callable, on a vote by two-thirds of the banks, if control of the company changed hands. Attorneys representing <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and some shareholders criticized the indemnity and change-of-control provisions as devices for entrenching <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management. But <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON>, in approving the plan, cited contentions by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> that the indemnities were necessary to end the litigation. He also cited testimony that the banks insisted on the change-of-control provision as a requirement for granting <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> the $ 3 billion loan.

A weakness in the cash prices of soybean oil and meal undermined the bean futures complex, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Slack export business pressured corn futures, which also suffer said <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>. Wheat futures were mixed, with some support coming from the export trade. On the opening, wheat was -RCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.08 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $ 2.06 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 cents lower with May at $ 1.63 a bushel; and soybeans were -RCB- cent to 6 cents lower with May at $ 6.65 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .27 cent lower to .10 cent higher with the April contract at 73.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .10 cent higher with April at 79.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .40 cent higher with April at 45.50 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to .43 higher with May at 53.65 cents a pound.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has imposed fishing sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in reprisal for alleged violations of an international whale conservation accord. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been granting permits allowing the killing of its minke whales in the Antarctic for research purposes. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, an official from the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said his government would seek to lift the sanctions through discussions with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. He said that the issue of fishing rights in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters had nothing to do with the whaling accord. `` The feeling is that we've been hit through some irrelevant issue,'' he said. Invoking the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to withhold 100 percent of the fishing privileges that would otherwise be available to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in an exclusive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing zone. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund, said Wednesday the announced fishing sanctions would hurt the Japanese to a degree. But he said the punitive measures come too late to save any of the 300 minke whales that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> plans to take in this year's research program. In his letter to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had been granting the whale-killing permits despite a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> resolution against this practice. That resolution recommended that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> refrain from issuing further permits `` until uncertainties in their scientific research proposals were resolved.'' The president's letter said the commission adopted a second resolution since the finding of non-compliance by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, in which the panel again recommended that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> discontinue the practice. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had no evidence that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` is bringing its whaling activities into conformance'' with the whaling commission recommendations. He said that because of this, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would deny <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s request to fish for 3,000 metric tons of sea snails and 5,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> whiting. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will be `` barred from any future allocations of fishing privileges for any other species, including <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> cod, until the secretary of commerce determines that the situation has been corrected.'' He called the sanctions `` the strongest possible'' under existing law. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, however, stopped short of moving against Japanese fish products imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying the steps he took represented the `` most effective means of encouraging <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to embrace the <ORGANIZATION> IWC </ORGANIZATION> conservation program.''

<TEXT>
 A Danish investment group plans to set up <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first alligator farm in southern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to produce skins and meat for export, the project's organizer said Thursday. `` The baby alligators would come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and be bred at the farm in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but it would take three to four years before production and export of the reptiles' skin and meat could begin,'' said <PERSON> Leif </PERSON> <PERSON> Skovgaard </PERSON> in a telephone interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skovgaard </PERSON>, a chartered accountant who is organizing the project for a group of seven Danish investors, said 10,000 to 12,000 alligators would be bred yearly at a farm near the town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roque </LOCATION>. European Alligator Institue, as the project is called, is seeking financial support from local and state governments in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The farm, which the group hopes to open by the beginning of 1989, would employ about 100 people, <PERSON> Skovgaard </PERSON> said. `` As alligators are dangerous at any age, our personnel will be specially trained to cope with them so they do n't lose fingers,'' he added. The investors hope to develop a nature park where visitors can observe the animals, which can grow to 15 feet in length, in an outdoor environment. Alligator meat, according to Skovgaard, tastes like something between veal and chicken, and is popular in American, British and French fish restaurants. The skins are used for shoes, handbags and other leather assessories. <PERSON> Skovgaard </PERSON> said he did not anticipate protests from animal protection or environmental groups. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> banned hunting alligators because the species was disappearing. but the ban was lifted recently after the alligators made a strong comeback.

 <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a major British bank, said Thursday that it would raise 921 million pounds, or about $ 1.72 billion at current exchange rates, by offering its stockholders the opportunity to buy new shares. A spokeswoman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, meanwhile, denied rumors that the bank was raising money to persue a friendly acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank holding company resisting a hostile takeover from rival <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` No talks are going on and we have no interest,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotrone </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> said the stock issue _ its largest ever _ will be used to expand domestic and international business, `` with particular emphasis on the major economies of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' Under the one-for-two rights issue, <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will be able to buy one new <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> share at a substantial discount for every two they already own. The bank said it will issue 369.5 million new shares at a price of 250 pence, or about $ 4.68, each. Expenses will be deducted from the total raised. News of the issue sent <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> shares tumbling on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The shares were down 48 pence each at 434 pence.

 Nearly two-thirds of American families of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> background have more than two people holding jobs, well above the national average, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports. Leading are Americans of Tongan descent, with 71.6 percent of families reporting multiple workers. But Filipinos were close behind with 71.4 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported in releasing final <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islander </LOCATION> statistics from the 1980 census. Overall, 63.3 percent of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> families and 57.6 percent of those from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands had multiple workers. By comparison, 54.2 percent of all families in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have multiple workers. While Tongans had the most workers, their median family income of $ 16,717 lagged behind the national average of $ 19,917 at the time of the count. Filipinos, on the other hand, reported median family income of $ 23,687, third among Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> ethnic groups. Tops in family income were the Japanese at $ 27,354, followed by Indians with $ 24,993. Koreans were most likely to be self-employed at 11.9 percent, well ahead of the 7.9 percent for Japanese. For the nation as a whole, 6.8 percent of people are self-employed. Cambodians were most likely to be foreign born, at 93.9 percent, followed by 93.7 percent of Laotians in this country. Only 6.2 percent of the overall population is foreign born. In terms of education, Pakistanis led with 58.4 percent being college graduates. Overall, 32.9 percent of Asians and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> in this country have college degrees, about double the 16.2 percent for the nation as a whole. The study covers all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents reporting their descent from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> or the islands of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, regardless of how long they had been in this country.

 Buoyed by favorable court decisions and growing political support, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' labor leaders say they believe they've got the momentum in the battle to save the financially troubled carrier. `` There's a new sense that the right people are finally listening to what we're saying,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of mammoth <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's very heartening to a lot of employees,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` Up until not long ago, everyone thought -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was unbeatable.'' `` I have felt a lot of confidence all along that we were gaining momentum, that we were going to get justice,'' added <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, veteran leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents 12,000 maintenance and ground workers in a company with 33,000 employees. `` <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was just arrogant ... thumbing his nose at justice. We've been able to hold the resistance movement together very effectively.'' Speaking in his union office less than five miles from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> offices of the Contra rebels _ the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> resistance _ <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> smiled as he realized his description of the unions as `` the resistance movement.'' `` We're an occupied country right now,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 54, a 32-year veteran of Eastern. `` It's our airline, we built it up. But we've been invaded.'' Eastern management officials declined to be interviewed about the recent developments. Spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the situation was too uncertain to speculate. But he said the unions have exaggerated the significance of court rulings and added that management still considers reducing labor costs crucial to salvaging the carrier, which has lost $ 900 million in the past 10 years. `` It still comes down to this: ` Do you pay baggage handlers $ 47,000 a year?''' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declared March 10 that Eastern was in contempt of court for trying to sell its profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle to another unit of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said he has accepted a report from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials that the airline no longer planned to sell off the shuttle and would not find them in contempt if they follow through with that pledge. On March 28, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, also in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, granted a preliminary injunction sought by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots which would prevent Eastern from using its planes to train pilots from <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern management hoped to use the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> cargo line to fly Eastern routes in case of a strike. The rulings were crucial to halting what the unions believe are two major pushes by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who began taking over Eastern two years ago following his successful takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and has since swallowed up <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and other small carriers. Stymied by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> unions in 1983, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> shut the airline down, took it into federal bankruptcy reorganization, got union contracts voided, and emerged with a low-cost carrier. The <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> injunction halted the `` spin-off'' of the shuttle, which the labor leaders see as part of a strategy by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to cannibalize <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. The Eastern reservations system was bought by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> last year, and planes and gates have also been sold off. The Parker injunction against training <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> pilots sets back <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s strike contingency program. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> warned machinists last December, when labor talks deadlocked, to be ready for a management-provoked strike that he said was aimed at crushing the union. But the federal mediator sent in for the talks has so far declined to classify the talks `` at an impasse.'' If he makes that declaration, a 30-day cooling off period must follow. The unions, in a national election year, have rallied political support. Democratic presidential candidates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management during February campaign appearances here. Congressional hearings have been held into Eastern safety practices and some congressmen are calling for a federal probe into the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> takeover. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> should correct `` deeply rooted and pervasive problems'' before gaining <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> permission to fly Eastern planes. Other unions have joined <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees in `` Jobs for Justice'' rallies on the Capitol steps and other locations. `` The attitude in other unions is if <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s model for destroying unions is successful, it may well spill over. It threatens most unions,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. The unions have numerous court cases, including lawsuits from fired employees and hundreds of pending grievances. The Machinists filed a new federal suit March 31 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> charging <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and other defendants with systematically violating federal securities and labor laws. More than a year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management called for a 30 percent reduction, or $ 490 million, in labor costs. Union leaders responded that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees have made concessions for years and are tired of paying for bad management. The employees say they want to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and run the airline themselves. `` Eastern has everything it needs to be a success: an established name; dedicated professional employees, good routes, major airports. We could make it the airline it should be,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Currier </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants local. Takeover strategist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> last month expressed interest in helping the unions realize their dream of taking the airline from <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. Independent analysts have said such a takeover seems unlikely but could intensify pressure on <LOCATION> Lorezno </LOCATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> empire is $ 5 billion in debt.

 Investors led by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> Thursday extended their $ 1.7-billion hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> until April 15, when a federal court ruling is due on whether the offer violates securities laws. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> said he was shocked that <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> board of directors has not yet given shareholders any advice on the $ 60-a-share offer, which has been on the table for two weeks. The board declared as inadequate <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s previous offers of $ 45-a-share and $ 56-a-share. Analysts said the Pittsburgh-based cement and building products company has strengthened its position by shifting the battle from the stock market to the courtroom. `` It looks like <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has won a lot of the early skirmishes,'' said an analyst at a Wall Street investment house who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Arbitrageurs who speculate on stock prices during takeover struggles are `` getting nervous,'' he said, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' `` stock has not been performing well. In late trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> rose 75 cents to $ 56.125 a share. As of Tuesday, 137,154 common shares out of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' 28.5 million outstanding shares had been tendered under <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, the suitors said Thursday. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> complained in a statement that the board is denying shareholders `` the benefits of an offer that neither it nor its financial advisers could conclude was inadequate.'' Observers say that the offer makes a fair valuation of the company. `` I think it's a very generous offer,'' said the Wall Street analyst. `` I think management should accept it.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Wednesday barred the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group from proceeding with its offer until April 15, when he plans to rule on <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' defensive lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> said his preliminary injunction will not take effect unless <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> succeeds in overturning a similar injunction issued Monday by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on antitrust grounds. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the takeover company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, failed to persuade a federal judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to revoke <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' poison pill, a shareholder rights plan that would greatly increase the cost of a takeover <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> testified before <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> Wednesday that he expects the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> board eventually will reject the $ 60-a-share offer and that the bid will be topped by some other bidder. But <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> added: `` I'm not sure I could hazard a guess as to when.'' <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has said it is considering selling all or parts of the company, borrowing heavily to recapitalize the company, or paying special dividends to enhance shareholder values in order to keep <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> away from <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s cut-throat business world, the highest acknowledgment of success is to be recognized as the `` taipan'' _ the Big Boss Himself. Later this year, a transplanted <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION>, 38-year-old <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, will assume the title _ the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> to do so _ only two years after arriving in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> as an executive with <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, the venerable trading company whose history is intertwined with that of this British colony. When the <LOCATION> Massapequa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> native becomes the company's senior representative in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> later this year he will inherit the prestigious title, which means big boss in the Cantonese Chinese dialect and traditionally is reserved for the local head of <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>. The company was founded in nearby <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> in 1832 by Scottish surgeon's mate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Highlander </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>. It moved to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in 1841 when the colony was established. <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>'s origins were in the opium and tea trade with the decaying Qing dynasty and the title taipan still brings to mind the early merchant ships plying the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The company has since evolved into a diversified international conglomerate that includes hotels, shipping management, vast lnd holdings and pizza parlor franchises. Throughout the company's rich history it has been led by Scotsmen, most recently by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Keswick </PERSON>. But when <PERSON> Keswick </PERSON> announced in March that he would step down as taipan, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> was named as his replacement. `` The fact that I was American was either neutral or to a negative ... probably more neutral,'' <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said in a recent telephone interview about becoming taipan. He added that he first learned of the title `` when everyone else did, with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavell </PERSON>'s book. <PERSON> Clavell </PERSON> authored `` Taipan'' and `` Noble House,'' two fictional accounts of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s business elite that romanticized the position of taipan. After studying economics at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and earning a law degree at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> joined the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Debevoise </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Plimpton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gates in 1975, handling corporation mergers and acquisitions. He then joined the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> as financial counsel. In 1981, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wolfensohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which he described as a `` ` boutique' merchant bank; very small with very large clients.'' He provided financial and strategic advice on mergers and acquisitions and in early 1982 was asked to help <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keswick </PERSON> was impressed with Powers' performance and in 1986 the American joined the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> company as executive director responsible for group strategy, corporate finance and financial services. Powers, a sandy-haired man who exudes confidence and good humor in his appearances at news conferences, quickly was named managing director of <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> and its three principal public holding companies, and joint managing director of its property arm, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Land </LOCATION>. On March 25, <PERSON> Keswick </PERSON> made public what had long been suspected, Powers would become the top <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> official in the colony. <PERSON> Keswick </PERSON>, chairman and managing director of <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> since 1983, said he would return to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after the annual general meeting in June and serve as the company's non-executive chairman. His family still retains control of the company through stock holdings. `` When one sees them -LRB- <PERSON> Keswick </PERSON> and Powers -RRB- operating together, clearly there is tremendous empathy, they seem to feed off each others' strengths,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurrier </PERSON>, a consultant to <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> who worked in the group for 13 years. `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s not only a strategic thinker but he's a doer.'' Powers, who speaks furiously fast and displays total recall, said he is excited about becoming taipan. `` Before I do anything there are always two things I ask myself: Do I think I'll enjoy it and will it be challenging.'' Powers takes over a company was nearing bankruptcy in the early 1980s largely because of a collapse in the local property market and a shipping slowdown. But it earned $ 101 million last year, up 64 percent from 1986. <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> employs more than 23,000 people in 22 countries while its affiliates have 53,000 people. About three-quarters of its business activity is in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but overseas operations are expected to expand, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. `` In terms of new busineses, of the acquisitions necessary to allow us continued growth, we have to look to overseas markets,'' <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. `` This is a natural pattern because the big groups with big capital and the family-controlled businesses in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> limit buying ability.'' For example, he noted that after two years of searching, the largest <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> business <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> could find worth purchasing was the 37-outlet Optical Shops. The price tag was $ 35 million. Other interests in the conglomerate include the Mandarin Oriental hotel group, life insurance, 7-Eleven convenience stores and Pizza Hut franchises. All this makes Powers `` excited at the big challenge of a multifaceted, diversified business'' that involves `` not one big issue but a series of issues to be faced every day.'' Powers, who will head the empire from his 48th-floor office above the colony's famed harbor, also said he's glad to be facing these challenges in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a teeming territory of 5.7 million people, whom he describes as `` wonderfully pragmatic.'' He has stressed the company headquarters will remain in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> even though <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> set up a firm in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> four years ago as the group's ultimate holding company. The move was made to ease the anxiety of trading partners about <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s future after 1997, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> regains sovereignty over the territory The new taipan was born Aug. 25, 1949, `` so that makes me an ox,'' he said in reference to one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. People born under the sign of the ox are said to be marathon workers and empire-builders. Powers and his wife, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>, have a son, 8-year-old <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON>. The new taipan enjoys tennis and golf, frequents the theater and has a fondness for <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> cellist <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>. Powers taught at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> before entering the business world and says he would one day like to return to teaching.

 For the next 18 months, those in a hurry here can fuel up their cars and themselves in one stop in what's believed to be the nation's first combination fast food, gasoline outlet. The city was chosen as the test market for an 18-month joint venture, which began Thursday, by Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Basically, we're both in the energy industry,'' said <PERSON> Suanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Map </PERSON>, a Burger King spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> provides food for the car and we provide the food for the body.'' <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Knake </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> marketing specialist, said both companies' clientele are similar `` Our typical customer is between 18 and 49. So that means our customers will match up pretty well with <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s customers,'' he said. `` And the typical <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> and Burger King customer wants speed. They want to save time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s end of the operation consists of four pump islands, a security booth and a cashier. The Burger King restaurant sits at the rear of a 150-foot lot and consists of a drive-through and walkup window but no sit-down service. Burger King customers can use their <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> credit card to pay for food. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> first approached Burger King in early 1986 with the idea, <PERSON> Knake </PERSON> said. He said the operation will be evaluated during the next 18 months. `` There are no plans to roll it out, because we do n't know how it's going to work,'' he said. `` We're going to have to evaluate it.''

<HEAD>Japanese Investment In U.S. Real Estate To Remain Strong, Bank
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Japanese appetite for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate is expected to remain strong this year but may not exceed the $ 6 billion they invested last year, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` At minimum, we expect Japanese investment to be equal to or slightly below 1987 levels,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, managing director of the bank's <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese remain concerned about volatility in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market as well as the nation's huge trade and budget deficits. But <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said in a statement that if there is improvement in `` the global economic and political issues that are causing'' those concerns, the amount invested in this country could be substantially higher than last year. Investment will continued to be focused on the west and east coasts, but the Japanese increasingly are looking beyond the major cities for opportunities. Among the new spots to draw attention are: _ <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> More than 150 Japanese companies have established subisidiaries in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, and that will serve as a magnet for more Japanese investment. _ <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tenn </PERSON> The bank cites <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> officials as saying about 10,000 workers are employed by Japanese firms within the state. As in the case of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, that is likely to lead to additional real estate investment there. _ <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore The city is becoming `` an increasingly well-known market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' largely because of its own promotion efforts, the bank noted. _ <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> noted that this city is particularly convenient because of simple airline connections to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Delaware Supreme Court Upholds TWA Against Howard Hughes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has upheld damages and interest awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in a 25-year legal battle with the late <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In a ruling dated April 4, the state's highest court upheld an award of more than $ 48.3 million in damages plus interest against the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON>. A Chancery Court in January last year awarded <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 17.2 million plus pre-judgment interest of about $ 31.1 million. Post judgment interest was allowed only on the damage award. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> filed the lawsuit in 1962, claiming the defendants had breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty by deliberately interfering with <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial success to benefit themselves. At that time, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> owned 78 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> stock. According to the ruling, <ORGANIZATION> Toolco </ORGANIZATION> used its control position to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s detriment. It said that because of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' evasive nature, <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> was slow to order jets <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> needed to remain competitive. <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> filed a cross appeal. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> sought to have post-judgment interest calculated on both the damage award and pre-judgment interest. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the claim was without merit because <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts `` have traditionally disfavored the practice of compounding interest, and we see no reason to depart from that rule here.'' <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> appealed on four issues, including a clain it did not breach its fiduciary duty to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> through its failure to place an earlier order for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets. <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> did not need that type of jet. <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> contended it should not be held accountable for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s lost profits due to <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON>'s failure to order such aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held that <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON>'s argument `` ignores the fact that the intrinsic fairness test placed the burden upon <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> to prove that it was not the cause of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s lost profits,'' and <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> failed to meet that burden. <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> also disputed the inclusion of accounting changes made by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> in late 1963 in calculating damages. The ruling said, however, that `` there was no error or abuse of discretion'' by including the accounting changes in calculating the damages through 1963. In its final argument, <PERSON> Toolco </PERSON> claimed it was erroneous to use an interest rate in excess of the legal rate in calculating the pre-judgment interest. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is a court of equity and `` has broad discretion, subject to principles of fairness, in fixing the rate to be applied.'' In <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the `` legal rate is a mere guide, not an inflexible rule,'' the ruling said. `` In selecting the interest rate the trial court considered the nature of the plaintiff, the nature of the wrong remedied, and the peculiar facts of the case. Each of those factors was appropriate, and there was no abuse of discretion in the court's choice of rate,'' the ruling said.

Cazenove, which acted as <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' broker during the Distillers bid, reaffirmed on Thursday a 1987 statement in which Cazenove denied that any of its representatives broke the law or offered `` improper indemnities or inducements'' to purchase Distillers shares.

 Stock prices gained ground in an erratic session today, getting a bit more mileage out of Wednesday's strong rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 64.16 points on Wednesday, rose another 7.46 to 2,069.13 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.

 Four years and two months after the start of an epic legal battle between two oil industry rivals, it took just 10 minutes Thursday for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to deliver a $ 3 billion settlement into the bank account of <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A half-dozen tight-lipped executives from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank-Houston </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> huddled around a computer terminal in a sterile bank office, waiting like expectant parents for the green computer screen to signal the beginning of the largest cash settlement in the nation's judicial history `` I'll be glad when it's over,'' a tense <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>, assistant treasurer of <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` It'll be a relief.'' Bank officials warned about a dozen reporters and photographers before escorting them into Room 1760 of the bank's <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division-Funds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> that the place was a high-security area and they would not be allowed to wander. Ironically, the bank is two blocks south of <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters and two blocks north of the downtown Texaco Building. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Somers </PERSON>, an operations officer at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly punched in the Pennzoil account number on her terminal to see if the Texaco money electronically appeared on the bank ledger. `` This is the largest one I've ever handled,'' she said. To get an idea of how much $ 3 billion really is, consider this: If you spent $ 1 every second, it would take 92 years to go through $ 3 billion. If comprised of $ 1 bills only, the stack would reach 203 miles high and weigh 3,061 tons, according to <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Polikoff </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s Bureau of Engraving and Printing. At <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which handled <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s end of the transaction from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Witkins </PERSON>, a senior vice president, gathered the cash from 26 or 27 banks using a task force of four people. `` It's not really the raw money itself, it's the sensitivity and the technicality,'' he said. `` You want the thing to shut out in one day. Three billion dollars works out to about a half a million dollars a day in interest. Money like that does n't sit around idle.'' At 10:03 a.m CDT, the first payment _ $ 600 million _ came in to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` So far, so good,'' someone said. <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> smiled faintly. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials notified Manufacturers Hanover the payment had been received. Then they waited, eyes still glued to the computer screen. There was little small talk. The minutes dragged. A bank spokesman explained that the next wire transfer probably was hung up in the computer queue behind other business. Mrs. <PERSON> Somers </PERSON> typed in the Pennzoil account number again. Payment No. 2 arrived at 10:10 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had another $ 800 million. <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> smiled a bit more. He and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, director of treasury operations for <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, scribbled notes on legal pads. At 10:12 a.m., another $ 700 million appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> account. <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>'s smile grew. Just a minute later, at 10:13 a.m., the fourth and largest single payment _ $ 900 million _ arrived. `` There it is,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Somers </PERSON> said. `` It's all in.'' <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> flashed a $ 3 billion grin. A few people began applauding. `` We're all very glad it's all over,'' <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> said, accepting congratulations, but hurrying out of the room. `` Going to call the boss?'' a reporter asked. `` Exactly right,'' the assistant treasurer said. A few blocks away, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON>, the colorful <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> legal team and stands to make millions from the case, was in court, trying another case. `` I do n't have any gloating feeling,'' he said. `` I'm just glad that the system of justice prevailed and we won. Now I hope they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- quit crying about it.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> and Sons, the fast-growing maker of beachgoer garb, has found itself the victim of shifting tides of fashion. The Orange County-based surfwear company sought protection from creditors by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal court on Tuesday, listing liabilities of $ 7.1 million and assets of $ 2.5 million. The company listed more than 200 creditors in court documents. `` We just needed the Chapter 11 to get over the cash-flow glitch that was created from the fall line not doing well,'' said the company's attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON>. `` Fortunately for us, the demand for <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> and Sons clothing right now is extraordinary. The company's problem is ... finding the cash to buy the merchandise to fill the orders,'' <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON> said. Under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code, a company is protected from creditors and permitted to continue operating and restructure itself under court supervision. The surfwear industry is fast-growing but highly volatile, made up mostly of tiny entrepreneurial companies. Sales industrywide this year are expected to be between $ 1 billion and $ 3 billion. <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> and Sons is considered a leader in the industry even though its annual sales are only $ 12 million.

 Foreigners continue to own just under 1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural land, slightly more than the level of a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said its 1987 year-end review of reports under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act found 12.5 million acres of agricultural land in foreign hands, 202,000 acres more than reported in 1986. Of the land owned by foreign interests, 50 percent was forest land, 17 percent cropland, 28 percent pasture and other agricultural land, and 5 percent used for non-agricultural purposes or unreported. Corporations held 80 percent of the foreign-owned land, with the balance held by individuals, partnerships, institutions and other entities. As in the past, much of the ownership is concentrated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Those countries combined to account for 69 percent of the foreign-held acreage, the agency said. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign ownership, with holdings of almost 1.79 million acres, mostly timberland, or more than 14 percent of the total. `` Ninety-three percent of the foreign-owned acreage will remain in agricultural production, according to foreign owners,'' the report said.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 26 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 17.06 a barrel; heating oil was .39 cent to .71 cent higher with May at 45.73 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to .40 cent higher with May at 48.82 cents a gallon. Livestock futures were mostly lower, while pork bellies advanced at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The cattle market is basically on the fence,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A recent bull market appears to have stalled because the profit margins of processors and retailers are very thin and they see larger supplies later in the spring, he said `` So they're not willing to commit themselves in a big way to feature or push beef.'' This means processors are resisting paying top dollar for live cattle, but at the same time there is no surplus of market-ready animals, so the producers are n't willing to drastically cut their prices. Pork futures are stymied by their high price compared with the cash market, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. `` The premium -LRB- about $ 7 a hundredweight -RRB- is about as wide as it's been any time in the 1980s,'' he said. `` So before they can move ahead, futures need cash prices to catch up,'' said <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>. Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with the April contract at 73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower with April at 79.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .45 cent lower to .27 cent higher with April at 45.35 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .08 cent to .40 cent higher with May at 53.32 cents a pound. Soybean futures prices put on a late rally and pulled corn a little higher at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A large speculator who had driven prices up earlier in the week came into the market as a buyer again, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. This forced traders, who had sold earlier in the hope of prices would decline, to start buying to limit their losses. Trading in the grains was relatively quiet. Corn was helped by the rally in beans while wheat has some underlying support from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bidding on a half million tons of the grain and the expectation that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> may be interested in buying some. Wheat settled 2 -RCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with the May contract at $ 3.13 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 \ cents higher with May at $ 2.07 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.65 a bushel; and soybeans were 5 -RCB- cents to 7 \ cents higher with May at $ 6.73 a Gold futures moved higher while silver was a little lower at the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 1.40 to $ 1.80 higher with the June contract at $ 452.70 a troy ounce; and silver was 3 cents lower with May at $ 6.435 a troy ounce. Stock index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index contract settled .20 point higher at 267.60. The underlying spot index closed .67 point higher at 266.16.

 All three measures of the nation's money supply rose in late March, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 768.3 billion in the week ended March 28 from $ 766.3 billion the previous week. Ther central bank said a broader measure known as M2 rose $ 4.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 2,979.5 billion from $ 2,974.9 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 3.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,746.7 billion from $ 3,743.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 760.2 billion, a 3.7 percent rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks.

Poor lending practices were cited in the demise of both banks.

Nationwide, 48 banks have failed and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has provided eight assistance transactions.

 The dollar finished lower against most major currencies Thursday, as transitory hopes of an international agreement to support the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency faded. Gold prices rose slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 448.85 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 448.25 late Wednesday. The dollar had risen earlier in the week, propped up by news reports that finance ministers of the seven major industrialized countries were likely to set a floor for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency at a meeting next week. The advance continued Thursday in the Far East and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but later ran out of steam in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as a modicum of bearish dollar sentiment returned. The Group of Seven, due to meet next Wednesday, is comprised of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Currency dealers noted that the dollar's decline was moderate and trading was fairly light. `` The dollar was fairly firm,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the currency's fall was cushioned somewhat by encouraging remarks on the nation's trade deficit by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The dollar has been hammered in recent months by negative news on the trade deficit _ which has indicated to traders that the currency might have to fall further in order for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to be sufficiently competitive. Besides the Group of Seven meeting, currency dealers are also looking toward the April 14 release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade data for February. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.67 Japanese yen to a closing 125.70 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted fractionally higher at 125.85 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 125.72 yen, down from 126.03 yen late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $ 1.8670 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.8790 late Tuesday. But later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.8756 from $ 1.8716 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6775 West German marks, down from 1.6790; 1.3864 Swiss francs, down from 1.3893; 5.6885 French francs, down from 5.6925; 1,243.75 Italian lire, up from 1,243.12; and 1.2483 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2416. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6810 West German marks, up from 1.6700; 1.3897 Swiss francs, up from 1.3775; 5.7022 French francs, up from 5.6570; 1.8865 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8720; 1,246.50 Italian lire, up from 1,236.50; and 1.2448 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2401 On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion rose to $ 450.80 a troy ounce from $ 449 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold dropped to a late bid price of $ 447.75 a troy ounce, down from $ 449.50 bid late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, it also fell to a late bid of $ 448.00 an ounce, down from $ 449.50 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 5.56 an ounce to close at a bid $ 447.65. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.40 a troy ounce, down from late Wednesday's $ 6.57.

 Dairy farmers complained Thursday they are not sharing in the agricultural economy's rebound from the devastating farm recession of the mid-1980s. `` Dairy farmers are facing a rough year while the rest of agriculture is prospering,'' a farmer told Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, following the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>'s remarks to the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairymen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The farmer, who rose from the audience at the meeting of the milk marketing and processing cooperative to question the senator, complained that the price of grain for feeding herds had climbed while the price paid farmers for their milk has declined. `` I ca n't say I do n't disagree,'' <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> replied. But he noted a `` healthy turn of events'' and added that in all his years as a farmer and member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he'd `` never seen a time when all segments of agriculture do well at the same time.'' The government this year reduced dairy price supports by 50 cents a hundredweight and another cut is possible next year because of surplus production that continued despite an earlier government herd buyout program. <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> told the meeting that the dairy industry may yet be able to provide alternatives to future cuts in price supports, despite efforts to reduce huge federal budget deficits. He encouraged dairy farmers to work with cattlemen, as they recently did in supporting a beef promotion referendum. `` The agriculture bloc has become fragmented in recent years, leading to a dangerous reduction in agriculture's political support,'' the senator said in his speech to the group. `` The diverse chorus of voices representing agriculture creates difficult choices for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. As <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> warned competing factions more than 200 years ago: ` We must all hang together or we shall all hang separately.''' Despite the call for unity, delegates later amended a resolution that would have encouraged members of the cooperative, with assets of nearly $ 367 million, to support the beef referendum. Instead, the group voted to be neutral on next month's beef vote. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, a senior vice president of the cooperative, said that change in position will be a bargaining chip in negotiations with cattlemen to seek their support for dairy programs. One recent example of unity in the dairy industry was a unanimous recommendation from its <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Dairy Policy, presented March 31 to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Secretary of Agriculture. The proposals by the 18-member panel of dairy farmers from around the country was the first unified industry proposal in more than a decade, said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> farmer who is chairman of the commission and president of Dairylea Milk. `` Everything we've done in the past has been a quick fix,'' <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said in an interview after he addressed the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairymen </ORGANIZATION>. He said the commission tried to come up with a dairy policy to carry the industry through the end of the century. `` The commission concluded federal policy should create an economic environment that makes profitability possible _ but not guaranteed _ for the nation's milk producers,'' he told the `` Those who are efficient, innovative and industrious will benefit under the commission's plan.'' He also noted that while the recommendations were unanimous, they also were controversial, adding, `` There is something for everyone to dislike.'' For example, it favors an end to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s separate manufacturing allowance for milk made into butter, cheese and nonfat dry milk. Among its major proposals, the commission recommended: _ Giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority to raise or lower dairy price supports by 5 percent, with a one-year limit of 50 cents a hundredweight _ Giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority to impose production controls when government purchases of surplus milk exceed 5 billion pounds in one year, and requiring production controls if surplus stocks rise to 7.5 billion pounds _ Providing the secretary of agriculture with two options for future production controls: a herd buyout program similar to the one that removed 1.1 million cows and heifers from the nation's herds in 1986-87 or a `` two-tiered'' price system that would provide a reduced price for any milk marketings above a set _ Support of quotas to limit imports of dairy products to keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from becoming a dumping ground for world foreign dairy surpluses Delegates at the 20th annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairymen </ORGANIZATION> later adopted their own legislative goals that included a call for de-emphasizing the use of price supports as a means of controlling dairy supplies.

 Stock prices worked their way higher in an erratic session Thursday, getting a bit more mileage out of Wednesday's strong rally. As has been the case for much of the time this year, smaller stocks turned in a better showing than the big-name blue chips. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained 64.16 points Wednesday, edged up another 0.50 to 2,062.17. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 988 up, 541 down and 473 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 177.84 million shares, against 181.76 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index rose .52 to 150.28. Over the past three days the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average has gained 81.47 points. Analysts said new signs of stability in the dollar had touched off rallies in stock markets around the world. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market climbed Thursday to new highs, having recovered all the ground it lost in last year's crash. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market showed less life. Prices of long-term government bonds declined slightly, putting their yields in the 8.75-8 .8 percent range And brokers said many traders were reluctant to chase after stocks while talk persists that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be leaning toward a tighter credit policy, and that leading banks might soon raise their prime lending rates.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced price reductions Thursday on nonrefundable fares for tickets purchased by April 17, joining two other airlines which cut prices earlier this week. None of the fares exceed $ 198 roundtrip, including those for transcontinental travel, and they apply to <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flights between noon on Mondays and noon on Thursdays throughout the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> route system. The fares are available for flights scheduled between April 18 and June 15. `` The timing of this sale is perfect for parents hoping to attend their children's graduation ceremonies at distant colleges and universities, for couples planning budget honeymoons to extend their travel range to include a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> resort, and for kids to get an extra visit from their grandparents,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>'s senior vice president of marketing. Once tickets are purchased, plans can not be changed. The fares may not apply to some routes served by <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> regional and commuter airline partners. The price reduction comes two days after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's sixth-largest and fifth-ranked airlines, respectively, said they were cutting some fares in anticipation of a slack period coming up for leisure travel. Although there are some minor differences, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> introduced similar programs. The non-refundable tickets must be purchased by April 14 -LRB- starting Tuesday for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Wednesday for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, and used for travel from April 18 through June 15. Passengers must travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday. Round-trip travel and a Saturday night stay are required. Those restrictions limit the program to eight travel days in April, 18 days in May and nine in June.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has rejected a takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that could have created the nation's largest supermarket chain, officials announced Thursday Lucky's board said in a statement it had unanimously rejected <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' unsolicited tender offer of $ 1.74 billion, or $ 45 a share, as `` inadequate'' and not in the best interests of the company or its stockholders. The board also rejected a proposal by the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> company to increase its bid to $ 50 a share in a negotiated acquisition. The rejection of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' surprise tender offer three weeks ago for Lucky's 38.6 million shares outstanding occurred 17 months after the Dublin-based company derailed a hostile takeover attempt by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> vice president for investor public relations, said his company had no comment on the announcement. Lucky's stock closed at $ 52.50 per share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, up $ 3.75 from Wednesday's $ 48.75 per-share close. Lucky's board also authorized company management and advisers to consider other alternatives to boost its value, including possible reorganization to focus on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> operations, a leveraged recapitalization with possible distributions to stockholders by a dividend or share repurchase, and a negotiated sale of the company to a third party. `` We are confident that pursuit of one of these alternatives will provide our best opportunity to achieve greater value for our stockholders,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON>, Lucky's chairman and chief executive officer. Lucky also announced its board adopted a warrant dividend plan and has declared a dividend under the plan of one common stock purchase right for each share of outstanding common stock, payable to stockholders of record on April 8. In its statement, <PERSON> Lucky </PERSON> said that its financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, advised the board the $ 45 tender offer and the $ 50 alternative were inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, financial adviser to the non-management directors, also advised the board the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> proposal was financially inadequate, the company said. Lucky, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s No. 2 supermarket chain, has 480 outlets, 340 within the state. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, a grocery and drugstore chain, had indicated it would convert its struggling 240 Alpha Beta outlets in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to Lucky stores. If successful, the move would have transformed Lucky into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s No. 1 grocery chain. A successful merger of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, with 1,700 outlets in 40 states, and Lucky would have make Lucky the nation's largest supermarket chain, surpassing No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> last year posted $ 14.3 billion in annual sales; Lucky had $ 6.9 billion In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Jewel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, paving the way for an extensive consolidation aimed at creating the nation's first coast-to-coast drugstore chain.
