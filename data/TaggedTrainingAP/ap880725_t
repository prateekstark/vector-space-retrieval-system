 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday he hoped a date for a cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> could be set within 10 days, but said this would be only a first step toward resolving the 8-year-old war. In a televised interview, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he wanted a cease-fire declared `` as soon as possible.'' He is scheduled to meet Wednesday with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in separate talks on setting up a U.N.-supervised truce. `` The ceasefire is not an end in itself. It's the first very important step. We want a total solution of the problem,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in the interview on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja </PERSON> <PERSON> Afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said on the same program that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was continuing to use chemical warfare against his country, even though <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it is ready for an immediate suspension of the conflict. <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, did not deny that his country had used chemical weapons but added that `` people should have learned by now not to take allegations by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at their face value.'' `` We have said, and I ca n't go beyond that, that we will use every means available at our disposal to repel this aggression, this persistent aggression by the Iranians against our country,'' <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said. `` Nobody should blame us after they have seen how these people behave,'' he said. `` We want to see genuine signs that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is really coming back to the ranks of civilized countries, and abiding by the rules.'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, also appeared on the program and said he sees <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> making a serious effort to end the war. `` I think they both made a decision to go for peace. Eight years is a long time, you get weary. It's unbelievable, eight years, how they could stand it,'' he said. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the war's casualties have taken their toll on both nations. `` It's the flower of their youth. It's their coming generation that they're going to be losing and I think that's why they have both come to the conclusion that this is the time to stop that kind of activity,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been escorting <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for about as long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has, but its secretive, low-key operation has attracted far less notice. While criticizing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for escalating tensions in the region and calling for a U.N.-sponsored force to replace foreign navies in the gulf, the Soviets have maintained their own flotilla in the waterway since late 1986. Five European countries _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> _ also have kept warships in the gulf in the past year. All of these forces, along with those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are expected to be reduced or removed if a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire takes hold. There are usually about 25 to 30 foreign warships in the strategic gulf, most of them American. The total in the region is around 60, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s sizable <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> fleet, based at <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION>. The exact number of Soviet vessels in the gulf and nearby waters is difficult to pin down, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say it has hovered at about seven to nine for the past year. The force normally includes two destroyers, plus oceangoing mine sweepers, tugboats and supply vessels. The Soviet convoys, with one or two warships escorting small groups of cargo vessels flying the flags of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other East Bloc countries, are often seen in the gulf. Their convoys sail without the air cover available to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships that escort U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, and their radio traffic is limited to routine exchanges and greetings with the warships of other nations. The only known example of direct cooperation between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces occurred Jan. 5, when a Soviet minehunter advised a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruiser in the gulf that it had found a mine, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters took part in a search for others. The mine eventually was destroyed by the Soviets, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s naval operations are run from a coastal anchorage near the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkhan </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, close to the staging area for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Kuwaiti tanker convoys. The Soviets have long maintained a naval base at <LOCATION> Socotra </LOCATION> island off the <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that is owned by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, the Arab world's only Marxist state. After the Iraq-Iran war broke out in September 1980, they posted one or two warships outside the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, gateway to the gulf. The deployment of Soviet warships to the gulf was never announced but became apparent when two destroyers turned up in the waterway shortly after Iranian gunboats intercepted two Soviet cargo ships in September 1986. In early 1987, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed to lease three Soviet tankers to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and provide them with armed escort. The move, seen by some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as part of efforts by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to expand its influence in the oil-rich region, spurred the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision to reflag 11 Kuwait-owned tankers with the Stars and Stripes. One of the Soviet tankers, the 67,9870-ton Marshal <PERSON> Chuikov </PERSON>, hit a mine off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on May 16, 1987. The incident was quickly obscured the next day when the frigate USS Stark was blasted by errant <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles, killing 37 sailors. Except for the Marshal <PERSON> Chuikov </PERSON> mining and a few reports of Soviet warships finding mines, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are not aware of any incidents involving the Soviet forces in the past 1 -LCB- years. `` The Iranians probably know that if they ever tried to interfere with a Soviet tanker, they'd be blown to bits and nothing would ever be explained one way or another,'' a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer said several months ago. The Soviets' gulf force consists of destroyers, of the 7,900-ton Sovremenny class or the 8,000-ton Udaloy class, and <PERSON> Natya </PERSON> or Yurka class mine sweepers. Foreign naval sources have said the ships are difficult to identify because the Soviets change hull numbers periodically.

<HEAD>More States Lowered Taxes Than Increased Them in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More states decreased taxes than raised them this year, and the total increase among the 27 states was an unusually low $ 600 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. The organization, in a survey of state tax policies, said 13 states raised taxes and 14 lowered them, with most revisions relatively minor. Traditionally, a tax change is considered `` large'' only if it results in at least a 5 percent increase or decrease in revenue. By this standard, the only `` large'' increases this year were reported in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and the only `` large'' decreases came in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, according to the conference. The survey is part of a broader report to be released this week at the conference's annual meeting in <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> `` To a considerable extent, 1988 tax actions are related to the tax policy followed last year,'' the conference said. `` The large number of tax increases last year helped to improve financial conditions and thereby avoided the need to increase taxes this year.'' The organization also said the $ 600 million tax increase this year is smaller than those in most recent years. In 1985, the survey said, there was a tax reduction of $ 1.3 billion. All other years since 1981 had tax increases of at least $ 1.1 billion, which came in 1986. The next smallest increase in this decade was a $ 2.3 billion rise in 1984. State tax collections exceed $ 260 billion per year, according to the conference. The survey said income taxes were reduced in 10 states and increased in two; motor fuel taxes were hiked in nine states; and sales taxes _ either through a higher rate or broader base _ went up in five states while being lowered in three others. The most significant tax increases this year came in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, although they were spared major tax hikes in 1987. Citizens in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> saw the biggest tax reductions after seeing taxes increase in 1987. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> were the only two states to increase income taxes. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> also hiked a number of other taxes including property and motor fuel taxes. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were the only states to increase their sales taxes significantly. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s sales tax went up 2 cents on food, utilities and drugs; and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s rate jumped 1 cent for a 13-month period. While the most frequent tax changes involved motor fuel, sales or income taxes, some states found other sources of revenue. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> increased their cigarette tax, joining 11 states that did the same in 1987, and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for the first time imposed such a tax. A recent trend of taxing mail order sales continued this year, with <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> joining 11 other states in enacting such a tax, which still faces court tests. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state increased taxes on hotel-motel rooms. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also increased its tax on hazardous waste while lowering a tax on aluminum casting. The property transfer tax increased in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and insurance premium taxes were lowered in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>.

 Planned truce talks between youth gang leaders did little to slow weekend bloodshed on inner-city streets as a wave of violent conflicts left four people dead and 10 others injured. The weekend violence erupted in the wake of announced plans by city church leaders to stage a truce summit this week between members of the city's major black street gang factions. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON>, 34, was critically wounded when an unknown assailant wearing gang-style clothing approached on foot outside a bar and shot him in the head after a brief argument, said Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON>. A brawl Saturday night between about 30 gang rivals in a <LOCATION> Boyle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> alley left a 17-year-old admitted gang member nursing a minor stab wound at <ORGANIZATION> County-USC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. Police also were investigating the discovery of a man's body on the street in gang-ridden south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after a shooting Sunday afternoon. Another man was wounded by gunfire Sunday in what he initially told police was a drive-by attack, Officer <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> later revealed he apparently was shot in self-defense by his landlord following an argument and fistfight, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

A shouting match with gang members escalated into gunfire that killed <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, who was fatally shot in a shopping center parking lot early Saturday morning, said police Detective <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>, also 18, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was struck by a single bullet in the attack, and was listed in stable condition at a <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Humphry </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Drought Necessary For Survival Of Okefenokee Swamp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FOLKSTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drought that has forced Okefenokee Swamp's wildlife to gather near deeper pools and its alligators to engage in cannibalism, is necessary for the survival of the swamp, a parks official says. `` The swamp has tolerated drought for thousands of years. Drought is a part of the biological process that creates open water areas and marsh areas,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroer </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Okefenokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. Swamp vegetation dries out during a drought, increasing the chance of wildfire ignited by lightning. But, <PERSON> Schroer </PERSON> said, wildfires are necessary because they burn off floating islands of peat, which eventually can turn into dry land. Indians dubbed the swamp `` the land of the trembling earth'' because of the undulating peat. In 1954 and 1955, fires raged for 12 months, burning 80 percent of the swamp, and fires in the 1840s created some of the Okefenokee's lakes by burning large holes in the peat. `` If it were n't for the natural wildfires that have occurred throughout history, the swamp would not be a swamp,'' said <PERSON> Schroer </PERSON>. `` It would be a forest.'' The peat floats to the surface of the swamp's reflective tea-colored water, forming islands that support vegetation. Eventually trees begin growing in the peat, sinking their roots into the swamp's sandy bottom. The islands get larger and larger, and without fires, they could be transformed into forests. The 700-square-mile swamp in southeastern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and northeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is home to many types of animals, including rare birds, fish, poisonous snakes and alligators. Many exotic plants also thrive, including orchids, lilies, cypress trees and carnivorous pitcher plants. President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> designated most of the swamp a national wildlife refuge in 1937. The drought has caused wildlife to congregate near water holes, <PERSON> Schroer </PERSON> said. Game officials recently counted nearly 1,000 alligators along a 5-mile spillway on the swamp's western side. `` When they get concentrated, predators have more prey,'' he said. `` Alligators start eating other alligators. We've seen some cannibalistic activity, but this is nature's way of keeping populations in check. The big males typically try to keep other males out of their territory.'' <PERSON> Schroer </PERSON> said water levels are 8 to 10 inches below normal on the east side of the swamp, near the <LOCATION> Suwannee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Levels are about a foot below normal near the 80-acre <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on the swamp's western edge near <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. And the water is 5 to 6 feet below normal near the spillway. Visitors can still take two-day canoe trips into the swamp from the <LOCATION> Suwannee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, but the longer trips of up to five days have been canceled because boats have trouble navigating some of the shallow trails, <PERSON> Schroer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Metts </PERSON>, assistant superintendent at <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Foster State Park, said anglers can still reach <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, a popular fishing spot, but canoe trails to <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON>'s and Big Water lakes are closed because of low water. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, general manager of the privately run Okefenokee Swamp Park near <LOCATION> Waycross </LOCATION>, said his park continues to offer 4-mile boat tours but has discontinued 10-mile tours deeper into the swamp to avoid damaging boat motors in the shallow water. `` The water is low, but it's not critically low like it was two years ago,'' he said.

<HEAD>NASA Begins Test Aimed at Firing Space Shuttle Engines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A practice space shuttle countdown was under way here today in a test leading to a firing of Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad Saturday. The launch team started the count at 11:33 p.m. Sunday. On Wednesday, it planned to load more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the shuttle's external fuel tank It will be the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986. When the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock lift-off on Wednesday, a problem will be simulated to force a launch postponement. Then launch crews will rehearse what's called a 72-hour turnaround. They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown, refill the tank and aim for a 20-second test firing of Discovery's main engines at 7:30 a.m. Saturday. The firing, with the shuttle bolted firmly on the pad, will check modifications made to the engines and is considered critical to Discovery being certified for the first post-Challenger shuttle flight. The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early September, but the date is in doubt as engineers continue to puzzle over how to fix a small gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main engines. They hope to make the repair on the pad and avoid rolling Discovery back to a hangar, a move that could delay the flight as much as two months. Experts are considering several ways to reach the inaccessible leak, including cutting a hole through the shuttle's cargo bay wall and running a snake-like tube through the gas line in an effort to plug it. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it will not make a decision on whether to move Discovery off the pad until after the main engine test firing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman was delighted that a national magazine named <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best place to live, but another resident says she was stunned because she finds the city boring. In its second-annual rating of 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> areas, Money magazine's current issue ranked the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> metropolitan area as the most livable <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, once was known as the `` hat city'' because hatters plied their trade here starting before the American Revolution The last hat factory closed in 1987. Today, the city of about 70,000 people is the home of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>'s largest employer. `` We are very happy here,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the giant chemical company. And the company, which moved its headquarters from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to an innovative suburban complex in 1980-81, is here to stay, he added. `` There's no better place to be. We came at a time when the city of <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> was beginning the sort of comeback they've since enjoyed,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. But a shopper on Main Street said she was surprised about the honor. `` I do n't know why,'' said the woman, who identified herself only as <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. `` It's boring. When we want to do something, we go into the -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- city.'' She said she hopes to move soon. Money magazine said <PERSON> Danbury </PERSON> unseated last year's No. 1 area, <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, because of a lower crime rate, slightly better schools and its proximity to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donchess </PERSON>, said the mayor, who was unavailable for comment, would not be upset about losing the top spot because <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> remained in the top 10. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said last year's top ranking gave the city more exposure. `` I'd go somewhere and say I'm from <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and people would say they'd heard of it,'' he said. `` The old saying used to be you go to <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> on the way to somewhere else.'' The magazine said its staffers studied government and private data on the 300 largest metropolitan areas, ranking their crime rates, housing, health care, economy, arts, education, transit system, weather and leisure activities. <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he was `` very proud.'' `` I'm not naive to think this took place in the last eight months,'' said <PERSON> Sauer </PERSON>, who became mayor in November. `` The reasons are the objects of our concentrated efforts _ low crime rate, medical facilities, parks and recreation _ we've worked on all of it.'' <PERSON> Sauer </PERSON> and Money magazine acknowledged that <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> has its problems. For example, a three-bedroom house typically costs between $ 175,000 and $ 250,000. <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> has had other troubles. The administration of former Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> is the target of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe that resulted in the confiscation of city expense and payroll records last year. And a former part-time probate judge and <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> lawyer allegedly embezzled more than $ 3 million from trust funds under his care before committing suicide last year. But many business owners who have worked and lived here their entire lives would n't live anywhere else. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappiello </PERSON>, who runs a card shop on Main Street, said she and her seven siblings were born in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>. Today, her 15 nieces and nephews all live and work here. `` I would say it is -LRB- the best place to live -RRB-,'' she said. `` I think we have a lot going for us.'' Her brother, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappiello </PERSON>, who runs a jewelry shop down the street, said he was a little surprised by the top ranking. `` Palm Springs has got to be a better place,'' he said.

<HEAD>German Politicians Reported Angered By New Italian Speed Limits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some West German politicians are calling lowered speed limits on Italian highways downright inhospitable, saying they appear aimed at catching unsuspecting German vacationers unawares. `` The purpose of this law is apparently to take money from vacationers,'' the mass-circulation newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted federal lawmaker <PERSON> Ernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinken </PERSON> as saying. `` Many Germans will be caught without knowing the law has been changed,'' <PERSON> Hinken </PERSON>, a federal lawmaker for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly told the paper. Under new rules that took effect on Sunday, the maximum speed permitted on <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s superhighways has been lowered to 110 kilometers per hour -LRB- 68 mph -RRB- from 140 kilometers per hour -LRB- 87 mph -RRB-. The maximum speed on <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s regular highways fell to 90 from 110 kilometers per hour. Italian authorities said the speed limits were lowered because of an increase in highway deaths. Thousands of West Germans are now taking to the road _ many of them en route to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and other southern points _ to start their summer vacations. There are no maximum speed limits on some sections of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s autobahns. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, a high-ranking politician with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION>'s Bavarian sister party, also criticized the lowered Italian speed limits. `` <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is a much-beloved vacationland with a reputation for hospitality. But I do not think these measures are hospitable,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>'s report, appearing it today's editions, was telexed to other news organizations in advance.

 A big <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> forest fire edged into Yellowstone National Park on Sunday but appeared to be slowing down, and firefighters fought to keep a separate fire inside the park from burning into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The south entrance to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> hotel and two campgrounds, remained closed Sunday because of other fires in the park, but officials stressed that all major park attractions remained open. Two fires that burned together over some 10,800 acres in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Gold Rush country were contained Saturday and 80 percent controlled Sunday, officials said. A fire is considered contained when a fire break is built around it, and controlled when it is reduced to smoldering patches. Hot, dry weather remained a factor as hundreds of acres of trees and brush also burned Sunday in smaller fires in parts of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Despite temperatures that reached 94 degrees on the fire lines, about 210 firefighters Sunday afternoon brought a 2,420-acre blaze on the <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> under control, said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wenatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> official. The 22,650-acre Mink Creek fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>'s Teton Wilderness grew by only 150 acres overnight but it crossed the boundary of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> into a rugged backcountry area, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinke </PERSON>, a fire information officer said Sunday. `` It pushed past <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> last night and moved just slightly into the park, probably one-quarter of a mile,'' he said. `` We have a few spots in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadows </LOCATION> area. But we have a crew up there mopping that up and it looks pretty good on the north end.'' A lack of wind during the night helped the fire stay within containment lines on its southern end, where it was within a few miles of private property. `` We think it's calmed down,'' <PERSON> Steinke </PERSON> said. He said 737 firefighters were strengthening firebreaks and mopping up hot spots. `` We made very good progress -LRB- Saturday -RRB-, and one reason was that we did n't get the predicted adverse weather,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, incident commander. `` Also, the crews are doing an outstanding job.'' On the western side of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, a 1,300-acre blaze threatening grizzly bear habitat in the park more than doubled in size by nightfall Sunday, sending a column of smoke more than seven miles into the air, authorities said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON>, a helicopter pilot helping dump water on the fire, said it was one of the biggest columns of smoke he had seen in 14 years of such work. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said earlier that 200 firefighters, assisted by nine fire engines, a helicopter and two bulldozers, withdrew to construct a fire line running roughly adjacent to the park's boundary to keep the North Fork fire from crossing into the <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` Basically, we've decided to allow nature to take its course,'' he said. The blaze began Friday about a quarter mile inside the Targhee, and then spread eastward into <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> six miles south of the point where the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> borders meet. Elsewhere in southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Sawtooth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Twin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Poison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire was about 40 percent contained at more than 2,000 acres, authorities said. The fire was threatening a cutthroat and rainbow trout fishery along with valuable deer habitat and recently transplanted bighorn sheep and wild turkeys. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters fought shifting wind, high temperatures and a threat of lightning Sunday in an effort to extinquish twin blazes in <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that caused $ 11 million in damages. Fire crews hoped to put them out by Monday night. `` We're holding our breath, waiting to find out what the weather's going to do to us,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> in the Mother Lode community of <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION>, 150 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Six homes, nine other buildings and eight vehicles have been lost since the arson-suspected blazes broke out Tuesday. There were 1,700 firefighters and support personnel on hand Sunday, down from a maximum of 3,400 Friday. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 160 firefighters worked to contain a 250-acre blaze in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness that threatened to spread into an area filled with dead and dying trees, said <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Riede </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>. At least 120 firefighters battled summer heat and wind at a blaze that scorched more than 250 acres of brush and timber near Flaming Gorge Dam on the Utah-Colorado border, <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` It's still an uncontrolled fire,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. No injuries or property damage were reported from the blaze, which is believed to have been ignited by fireworks.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Child-Care Program, Starts Considering Running Mates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after outlining a $ 2.2 billion child-care program designed to help close his gender gap with women, is turning his attention to selecting a running mate. The vice president says he expects to have `` some kind of a list'' of potential running mates prepared by sometime this week, although he hopes to delay announcing his choice until the GOP convention next month. The certain Republican presidential candidate was expected to spend much of this week mulling over his vice presidential selection and had few campaign events scheduled. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was drawing mixed reviews for his proposal for child-care tax credits of up to $ 1,000 per child for low-income families. For the neediest families _ those earning less than $ 10,000 a year _ the `` credit'' would become a direct government payment of the maximum $ 1,000 for each child of four or younger. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the proposal Sunday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> and Professional Women's Clubs in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, ending a five-day burst of campaigning in seven states. `` It was a gutsy move on the part of the vice president,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, domestic affairs director for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. The vice president's plan was a sharp departure from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's past policies on child care, and bears a price tag similar to a $ 2.5 billion Democratic plan now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic proposal chiefly sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., which Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has endorsed `` in concept,'' would provide the money to child-care providers instead of to individual families as under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON>, president of the federation to which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke, called the plan `` one of the first concrete gestures that the vice president has made'' on issues concerning women. But, she added, `` We know that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a problem right now with women voters in this country. So until the Republican party starts to very seriously take a look at those kinds of things that are making a difference, it could pose real problems. ... `` There are simply not enough Republican men to get him -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- elected without the woman's vote,'' she said. At the conclusion of his speech, many members of the audience of 2,500 women chanted `` E-R-A'' over and over, for the equal rights amendment which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes and which he did not mention in his talk. `` We would have liked to have him address the equal rights amendment, which continues to be this organization's top priority,'' federation president-elect <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. The organization's leaders said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also had been invited to address the convention, but had conflicting plans. There would be no strings attached to how the proposed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tax credit-payment could be spent. To qualify, at least one adult family member would have to be employed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> on Sunday on Air Force Two with former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, a frequently mentioned vice presidential possibility whose speech to the group followed the vice president's. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, wife of former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, helped worked on the final draft of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, according to her aides <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said there was no discussion of the vice presidential selection process on the plane. The vice president told reporters that screening of potential running mates _ to look into backgrounds and financial histories _ would begin this week. Prospective candidates will be asked to fill out financial disclosure statements, he indicated. `` So by sometime next week, there will have to be some kind of a list,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> audience his `` Children's Tax Credit'' would range up to $ 1,000 per child under age 4 and would be `` refundable'' _ meaning families could receive something from the government even if they did n't earn enough to pay taxes. The vice president said the credit would be phased out as income rises. He gave no details on exactly how this would be done. Background information provided by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff said the tax credit would cost $ 1.5 billion a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s four-point program also included: _ Expansion of the existing child-care tax credit to cover more low-income families, for a cost of $ 400 million a year _ Creation of workplace child-care centers for all government employees and a federally underwritten liability insurance program for private centers, $ 50 million a year _ More federal assistance to help states and local governments set up programs such as sick child care and before-and-after school care, $ 250 million

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned from a midsummer's vacation amid heightened expectations that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will resign soon to run <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign Neither <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials would confirm publicly that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will be leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> soon, although presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not flatly deny it. Given the opportunity Sunday to say <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would not leave the treasury post, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said only: `` He's still treasury secretary. Put it that way.'' But an administration official, declining to be named publicly, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s resignation likely will be submitted to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in early August, possibly as soon as next Monday, with plans to hook up with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in mid-August. A Baker move to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign would not be shocking since there has been speculation for months that the longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confidant eventually would move from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to the campaign. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> managed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s unsuccessful run for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination in 1980. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> accompanied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, on the flight from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday, although the treasury secretary was not observed boarding the plane with the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> at Point Mugu Naval Air Station. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> evidently had boarded before the contingent of reporters arrived to greet the Reagans, who had flown to the military base from their ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The secretary also spurned a request by a pool of reporters on Air Force One to come chat with them. Instead, he sent back a folder that contained a dollar bill. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wrote, `` Please note the title under the signature is secretary of the treasury.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said only that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who had been the president's chief of staff from 1981-85, merely had a `` very brief chat.'' An official who discussed the situation on grounds of anonymity said the secretary had spoken at a fund-raiser Saturday night for Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., and `` essentially, he is hitching a ride. But another official said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would not have needed to inform <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of his plans on the Air Force One trip, saying the secretary's decision to take over the vice president's campaign had been known for some time. When <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> got off the plane at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a reporter asked the secretary, `` Can you share the news with us?'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> replied, `` There's no news to share.'' Asked if he had spoken with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about quitting, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had not. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been an unofficial adviser to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign for some time, and had accompanied the vice president to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> last week for a fishing trip. If <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were to leave, it would be the second major <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> change in recent weeks. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> friend, has resigned effective late this month or early next month. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominated former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s replacement. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vacationed last week at his ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, senior aides discussed the administration's agenda for the remainder of the president's term. This week <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will assess the prospects for new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels _ a subject that is on the agenda for a Tuesday morning meeting with Republican congressional leaders. He also plays host Wednesday to Hungarian Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> in the first such visit by a high-ranking Hungarian official since the country came under <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> rule 40 years ago. Since becoming premier in June 1987, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has sought improved economic and political ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> began an 11-day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour last week. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will receive an updated report on the drought from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, who took a 10-state tour last week.

<HEAD>Would There Be a Tomato Garden in a Dukakis White House?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people try to figure out whether to put <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the candidate reveals that his daydreams about 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue leave him with a perplexing question: Where do you put the tomato garden? `` I'm trying to figure it out _ wherever there's full sun, right?'' he told reporters traveling with him over the weekend. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor says he grows three varieties of tomatoes in his back yard in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, along with some cucumbers and peppers. He says he worries about them when he's on the campaign trail, although his neighbor is watering them. Maybe it was the swing through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farm areas that got him thinking about moving that vegetable garden to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It would n't be good to cut down any of the famous White House trees. And do n't worry about the Rose Garden. No point planting there, he says, because it's too close to the building. `` A good tomato garden with cukes, peppers, has got to be right out there'' in the open, `` Right?''

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is mindful that keeping ahead in the polls sometimes requires placing things on your head. On his first post-convention campaign swing last weekend he posed for pictures with a Scottish tam-o' - shanter and an Assyrian headpiece and some No doubt, before campaign's end he'll be donning an American Indian headdress, a cowboy had, hard hat and others. Although he's not usually a hat man, he was taking it all in stride until, at a rally in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> showed up with the special hat he built for the Democratic convention. The boater had a stuffed animal attached to the top holding up a torch, sort of like a furry statue of liberty. It was the kind of hat usually worn only at political conventions -LRB- last week's featured such beauties as <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s cheese hats -RRB- But <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> has been ailing and could n't make it to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. So he obviously figured that having the party's new nominee in town was a great time to show it off. But when he brought it out on the stage, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made no move to touch it, looking at it as if the furry thing might bite. Finally, <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> balanced it on his own head, the crowd cheered with approval, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smiled.

 One of the most exciting moments for reporters covering the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign swing came Friday when the press plane, landing in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, slammed into the runway, bounced up, and then several seconds later landed again. The Secret Service, which had several of its agents on the plane, called for an inspection and on Saturday it appeared the plane would be pulled out of service. However, repairs were completed on time and the press plane continued to follow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, and Erie, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. After Erie, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and wife B.A boarded the press charter flight back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, instead of continuing to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I've heard about this plane,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I did n't want to get on this one until we tested it with you guys,'' the senator quipped. Meanwhile, as the campaign moves into full swing, there are tentative plans for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to take over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 and for the governor to charter a larger plane. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will be inheriting a plane that once was Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign jet. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane's exterior spruced up and its interior redone with a little office up front separated by a curtain from the press and federal agents in the back

 Americans overwhelmingly favor maintaining or increasing the federal budget for space exploration, even while three in 10 doubt <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s competence, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. The national survey of 1,223 adults found that nearly half those questioned lost confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> after the space shuttle Challenger exploded in January 1986, and 60 percent of those, or 28 percent of all questioned, say they still lack faith in the agency. However, 40 percent of the respondents said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing too little in space exploration, and majorities supported the initiatives of building a space station and sending manned flights to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. The space shuttle program also won support, with 40 percent saying it should be expanded and as many saying it should be maintained. The first shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster is scheduled for September, although a leak in a gas line is threatening to delay it. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was rated positively overall. Fifty-five percent said the agency has done a good or excellent job, while 37 percent rated it only fair or poor. Only 18 percent said the space budget should be decreased, while almost half said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget should remain the same and 30 percent said it should be increased. Of those who favored an increase, 74 percent said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to accomplish it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this month approved $ 200 million for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s space station program, only enough to phase it out or put it on hold. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 700 million, and a joint committee is to resolve the issue. Fear of falling behind in space may be one reason for the public's support for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s funding. Just 23 percent of respondents said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ahead of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in space exploration, while the remainder were split on whether the Soviets are ahead or the two countries are about even. In any case, a plurality of respondents favored superpower cooperation in space: 49 percent favored last month's proposal by the Soviets for a U.S.-Soviet joint effort to send astronauts to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Fifteen percent said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should work alone to reach Mars. Together, 64 percent favored some program to land astronauts on Mars, while 30 percent were opposed. The rest had no opinion. Support for a space station was nearly as high, with 55 percent in favor and 34 percent opposed. The rest had no opinion. On the space shuttle, 40 percent said work should be expanded and the same number said it should be kept at the same level. Fewer than a fifth said the shuttle program should be cut back. The poll found a striking split between the sexes, with men far more likely than women to favor space programs. Fifty-six percent of men said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing too little in space exploration; only a quarter of women agreed. Forty-one percent of men supported increasing the space exploration budget, compared with just 19 percent of women. Overall, 40 percent of respondents said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing too little in exploring space and 36 percent said it was doing about enough. Nearly a fifth said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing too much in space exploration, the remainder had no opinion. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> 30 years ago to pursue civilian exploration of space. In recent years, the agency increasingly has carried military payloads as well. A slim plurality in the survey opposed that development: 48 percent said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> should be involved in non-military projects only, while 41 percent approved including military work. The split was narrowly outside the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Media General-AP poll consisted of telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with a randomly selected sample of 1,223 adults across the nation. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> -RRB-.

<HEAD>Panel Abandons Idea of Taking Mine Inspectors Out of Interior
Department</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee has quietly given up the idea of transferring strip mine regulators out of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, long critical of the department's Office of Surface Mining, made the decision earlier this month after a discouraging report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' research arm, said such a move `` could disrupt and destabilize the program for two or more years'' and would not necessarily mean improvements. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the subcommittee chairman, and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON>, R-Pa., wrote other members that in light of the report, `` we think that a transfer at this time is not the way to solve the existing problems The letter, provided last week by subcommittee aides, said no members had expressed disagreement with the conclusion. `` We plan to urge that the incoming administration, whether <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> or Democratic, give top priority to making the fundamental changes necessary,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON> said. A year ago <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> to investigate transferring the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> to some other agency. He first raised the idea two years ago following a subcommittee report that documented difficulties the office had in getting states to enforce their own regulations and in collecting fine and penalties. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> associate director, said in a report dated June 9 that only one of 16 people consulted from environmental groups, the coal industry and state governments favored moving the office out of interior. `` After 10 years of struggle to implement -LRB- the act -RRB-, stability is needed,'' was the consensus. The dissenter, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, argued that `` moving this function would eliminate the institutional conflict that exists at interior between developing mineral resources and protecting the environment and would send a clear signal to the receiving agency that it should given additional attention'' to the mission of the office, <ORGANIZATION> Duffus </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> said in the report that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> should take over the regulatory role `` because of its experience with water pollution and runoff, water expertise and good reputation as a regulatory agency, and experience dealing with citizens' concerns and involvement in pollution problems.'' Another view came from former Deputy Undersecretary of Interior <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON>, now a staff member at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, who suggested grouping all of interior's regulatory programs under one assistant secretary. He said the mining industry did not believe <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> would `` provide a proper balance between -LRB- the act's -RRB- stated goals of energy production and environmental protection.'' `` We have also reported problems in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s management with respect to cleaning up hazardous waste and enforcing air standards,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also said there would be a long period of adjustment to any change. `` Substantial problems during initial periods of reorganization are inevitable,'' such as `` delays in obtaining key agency officials, inadequate staffing, insufficient funding, inadequate office space and difficulties in establishing support functions such as payroll and accounting systems,'' the report said. `` We found that solving these start-up problems resulted in delays ranging from nine to 30 months and distracted agency officials from concentrating on their new missions during the critical first year of operations,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, spokesman for the Office of Surface Mining, said, `` We agree that it would be counterproductive to transfer the -LRB- office -RRB- to another agency.''

 Sitting stiffly and avoiding eye contact, the leaders of four groups fighting for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> began their first talks today to try to fashion a political settlement. Their host, <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, said they would discuss such difficult issues as national reconciliation, forming a provisional government and building a neutral <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which has been at war almost continuously since 1970. `` We of course realize that on these aspects ... there are divergences of views among you and that many years of conflict and contention have caused estrangment that may impede a quick convergence of positions,'' he said in an opening speech. <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> said such a complex problem could n't be solved through a single meeting, but a solution will never be found unless a start is made to replace war with dialogue. The four Cambodian leaders gathered in a chandeliered room in the old palace of the late President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> for informal `` cocktail party'' talks that have raised hopes for peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In large easy chairs around a thick, circular table sat <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-installed government, and leaders of three guerrilla groups opposing him.

As they gathered, three saffron-robed <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks who had traveled from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> filed into the palace to pray for success. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and by Western count maintains more than 100,000 troops there, was to meet the Cambodians in a second stage of talks in the afternoon. That meeting was also to be attended by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Communist ally, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, and by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which backs the guerrillas. At a photo session just before the morning talks, the leaders smiled at photographers and <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> waved, but they studiously avoided making eye contact with one another. Instead they gazed at huge Western-style oil paintings on the walls. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Senn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> have held two previous rounds of talks without success, and the current meeting represents the first gathering of all four <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> parties. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has never talked with the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance factions. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, meanwhile, was visiting <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> capital just 40 miles from <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> but had no known plans to attend the talks. A Indonesian source said the former <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> monarch might make an appearance in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, depending on progress in the talks. Earlier this month <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> resigned as president of the guerrilla coalition, charging the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> were killing his men. The tentative schedule called for two days of talks with the second day having the same format as the first _ the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> factions talking in the morning, then the Vietnamese and others joining in the afternoon. The talks are based on a July 1987 <LOCATION> Vietnam-Indonesia </LOCATION> agreement that calls for informal discussions to encourage the various antagonists to participate and allay <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s refusal to negotiate directly with the guerrillas. Disputes between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> delayed the talks, which were not confirmed until the last minute. The association includes the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Since 1970, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has suffered a devastating five-year civil war, a reign of terror by the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1978, a 1978 Vietnamese invasion and a continuing guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed government. Millions of people have been killed in the turmoil. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has announced it will withdraw 50,000 troops, or about half its force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, this year and the rest by early 1990. Though Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> are allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in a resistance coalition, they strongly distrust the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 Thirty drivers saddled up their buses for a 10th annual rodeo, as ribs and chicken sizzled on open-pit grills. The <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> rodeo was slower-moving than a Western counterpart, but competitors said it requires an equal amount of skill. `` A lot of people could n't drive a car through this course, let alone a 40-foot bus,'' driver <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillett </PERSON> said Sunday as he eyed the orange cones and barrels charting the course across the Castle <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> subway station parking lot, near <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.

 It used to be that <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' lottery millionaires could count on leaving their wallets home at least one day a year _ the day of the Millionaire's Reunion. But this year, after criticism that the lavish reunions were a waste of taxpayers' money, a thriftier affair is planned and the millionaires are getting stuck with some of the tab. The big money winners used to get lunch on a cruise ship, dinner and dancing at a classy spot and a night at a top hotel. At this year's reunion, on Aug. 19, they'll get beer, bratwurst and baseball _ and they'll have to pay for their own hotel rooms. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyc </PERSON>, a $ 3.8 million-winner from <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, says he'll attend the luncheon, but skip the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> game, dinner and a special discount night at a Hyatt hotel. `` I thought the cost of last year's -LRB- reunion -RRB- was kind of exorbitant, but I'm conservative that way,'' Nyc said.

 Nine ducklings and their parents lived it up at the swank <LOCATION> Ritz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> where they swam in a Jacuzzi and dined on escargot, fresh lettuce, melba toast and bottled spring water served by white-gloved waiters.

 It takes more than 12 hours of practice a day under blazing sun or summer rain to get the precision right. But any student who wants to be in the Garfield Cadets Drum and <ORGANIZATION> Bugle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> knows that is the kind of summer $ 500 will buy. `` It's a lot like <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> boot camp,'' said 19-year-old <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Klophaus </PERSON>, a first-year corps member from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The 54-year-old corps, headquartered in the northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Garfield </LOCATION>, is made up of student musicians, ages 14 to 21, from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The cadets are the current <ORGANIZATION> Drum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> champions. Next month, they will try for an unprecedented fifth DCI World Championship as they compete against 70 other corps in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Until then, the <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadets </PERSON>, who number about 100, will don their maroon and off-white uniforms and strut their stuff across eight states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as they complete the second half of their Summer 1988 tour. `` The biggest thing that makes them special is the type of training,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, a visual instructor. `` It's very extreme.'' <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, 30, stands on the bleachers during practice to make sure the cadets' presentations are pleasing to the eye. `` The type of work and pressure they go through is similar to what someone in their age group would do when trying out for the Olympics,'' <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> said. `` The prestige of winning is ... like winning a gold medal.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, the group's executive director since 1982, said the corps challenges itself by purposely bypassing anything that might come easily in favor of the most difficult routines. `` If we know that we can do it, then we will not do it,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. A day at training camp in this northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> community begins at 7:30 a.m., when the corps rises, eats breakfast and starts practicing no later than 8:30. About 2:30 p.m., they eat again. They return to practice a half hour later. Dinner is served at 6:30 p.m., then the cadets are back at work for three more hours. They're free until lights out at 11, but often spend the time discussing improvements for the routine, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawrylko </PERSON>, a corps spokesman. All this, including bedding down on gymnasium floors, costs $ 500, which the cadets pay as a membership fee. `` I wanted to learn what hard work is and what it does to you,'' said first-year cadet <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Geltch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Crossing, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It's made me concentrate more.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Poquis </PERSON>, a 20-year-old baritone horn player from <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said: `` I learned that no matter how downhill and exhausted you are, you can still push yourself that extra step. It builds character.'' Following the cadets from city to city is an 18-wheel truck that carries food and other supplies. Another 18-wheeler carries the instruments, along with the streamers and flags for the color guard. Four buses transport the cadets, vans carry instructors and support staff, and a 24-foot promotional bus tags along. Like most other drum and bugle corps, the <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadets </ORGANIZATION> raise money with cake sales, car washes, donations and raffles, along with membership fees. The corps has an annual budget of $ 450,000 to $ 500,000, said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Pych </PERSON>, a member of the board of directors. This year, however, the cadets received their first corporate sponsorship, from K mart Stores and <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pych </PERSON> said. He said exact figures were not available. Besides becoming better musicians, the cadets are taught good competitive manners, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> said. `` You never are a sore loser or an obnoxious winner,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Corn Plant Could Help Third World</HEAD>

 A government agency is touting a new strain of corn as a potential source of protein for children in the Third World. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> calls the new corn QPM for quality-protein maize because it contains about twice the usable protein of ordinary varieties. Maize is the international word for corn. A small research team, working for 10 years, developed QPM at the same laboratories where Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borlaug </PERSON> produced the new wheat varieties that brought the `` green revolution'' in the 1950s.

<HEAD>Talks Between U.S., Soviet Militaries Might Spur Arms Reductions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet military officials have told their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts that top-level talks between the nations' militaries might resolve technical problems that are roadblocks to agreement on conventional force reductions, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top defense officials, during a recent six-day tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the military contacts might lead to a formula for reduction that has eluded civilian arms negotiators because it would be based on a joint military assessment of what constitutes equal strength. The paper quoted sources as saying that Soviet Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> told Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, that equal strength need not mean one-to-one equality in the numbers of arms and equipment because of technological and structural differences between the two militaries. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> spent hours explaining to each other their basic military doctrines and the fears they have about each other, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. They agreed, the paper quoted <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> as saying last week, that there are two problems to be overcome, `` Mistrust and the difference in the structures of our two militaries.'' The discussions between <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> have enabled the pair to form a personal relationship, similar to one that has developed between <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Next week, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for his third round of private meetings with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>. The two already have spent nearly 14 hours together discussing similar questions of doctrine and forces, first in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> last March and then during the May summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. At <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>'s invitation, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> is planning a trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sometime next year.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> quietly ended his dramatic week in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> saying his mission now is to help <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win the White House this year. `` My focus now is on the fall campaign,'' he told reporters as he left a downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hotel Saturday. `` We'll be spending a lot of time organizing for voter registration, issue interpretation, involving people _ many for the first time _ and a big turnout for the fall campaign.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his second race for the presidency, would not talk about whether he would make a third run for national office. `` We'll have to determine what will happen, based on the outcome of the campaign. But we take this journey one phase at a time,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took members of his family, campaign staffers and journalists who covered his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination to <PERSON> Paschal </PERSON>'s, a well-known black-owned hotel and restaurant, for lunch, then left from <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in a chartered jet. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s relaxed departure was a marked contrast to the motorcade of buses he took to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 16, two days before the start of the Democratic convention. He addressed thousands of cheering supporters in <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> that day, asserting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, then assured of the nomination, must give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a stronger voice in the party. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday his campaign made great gains in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He said blacks and others previously outside the party mainstream will have unprecedented involvement in the fall campaign. And he noted that several <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> platform positions were adopted. `` We can leave <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with a real sense of inspiration because of the expansion of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, more inclusion, involvement in the campaign at all levels, vertically and horizontally,'' he said.

 The spiritual leader of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists believed to be holding foreigners hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has called for a new approach to the crisis that would bring a `` happy ending.'' Sheikh <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, the spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, made the comments just as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> prepared to enter U.N.-sponsored talks to end its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, in a sermon Sunday, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of using the hostage crisis for political purposes. But he also called for a swift resolution to the problem. `` We call for a just and practical solution to this problem to achieve a happy ending,'' he said. `` We are aware that the -LRB- hostages -RRB- problem has reached such a degree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed up with its humanitarian aspect.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for the militant Shiite factions holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine Americans are among the captives. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s comments came during a one-hour sermon to Shiite zealots marking the major Moslem feast of al-Adha in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> mosque The hostages are widely believed to be held in <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madi </LOCATION> barracks building about ten blocks from mosque in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern suburbs, a Shiite stronghold <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has had some 5,000 troops patrolling most of the southern suburbs since May 27, but they have stayed away from the immediate area of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontation that could imperil the hostages. Syrian soldiers, however, control all approaches to <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and man high-rise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks. It was not clear whether <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s call signaled a breakthrough for the hostages. He has made similar calls during the past two years with no results. `` On the occasion of this feast, we call on all sides to begin acting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect of this problem could be resolved,'' he said. `` We feel pain for the detention -LRB- of the hostages -RRB- because the issue has humanitarian aspects,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and European nations of `` manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons to impose their dominance on the world. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather used it as a means of political pressure on each country and people that resist its imperlialist policies,'' he added. It was <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s first reference to the hostages issue since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced July 18 that it was accepting the year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Political observers believe a truce in the war could facilitate efforts for the release of the hostages. Nine Americans are among the 18 hostages. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <PERSON> Mmiddle </PERSON> <PERSON> Eeast </PERSON> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was seized March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, reached by telephone Sunday at her home in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said, `` I do n't see that it -LRB- the holding of hostages -RRB- should be a political issue. It's a human issue. `` Everything I've been hearing out of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> lately gives us reason to hope and it's been a very, very long time since we've had occasion to be hopeful.''

<HEAD>FDA To Allow Import Of AIDS Treatment Drugs Not Approved For U.S.
Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 A federal agency's decision to allow AIDS patients to import treatment drugs that have not been approved for sale in this country gives new hope to victims of the deadly disease, a homosexual rights activist said. Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, announced the change Saturday during an address at a conference here on homosexual health issues. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the government officially began allowing importation of some unapproved treatments of acquired immune deficiency syndrome Wednesday. `` -LRB- The decision -RRB- allows AIDS patients to make some choices about their own treatment,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the conference. `` If you're dying, you do n't have a lot of choices.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> attorney who researches worldwide AIDS policies agreed. `` From the AIDS person's point of view, they have nothing to lose and what they need is just some little optimism in their life,'' the attorney, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON>, said Sunday. `` If there's a risk, I think that they should be able to make the decision about whether to assume that risk.'' He called the program `` a signal advance in recognizing the gay and IV-drug constituencies that have been calling for this.'' Intravenous drug users, along with homosexual males, are the primary sufferers from AIDS. `` It's almost a shock because it's so contrary to the character and the tradition of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> said. Psychologist <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, associate dean for education at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the change responds to the frustration felt by homosexuals `` that -LRB- AIDS -RRB- answers are n't coming more quickly.'' `` I am a gay person myself. -LRB- But -RRB- I think that the frustration focuses on the bureaucracy as though the ultimate obstacles were in the bureaucracy,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` The real problem is that nature is very slow and reluctant to yield up her secrets.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he believes AIDS patients' desire for experimental drugs can be balanced with scientists' reluctance to use the drugs if the patients `` give up the right to sue if things go badly.'' Young and other <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that such unapproved drugs as dextran sulfate and ribavirin have been allowed into the country on an informal basis. The new policy sets a formal procedure for those who certify that the drug is for their own use. Small amounts will be allowed, generally enough for three months of treatment, as an assurance that the drug is not intended for sale. Ribavirin is an anti-viral drug that can be purchased in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Dextran sulfate, developed as a blood thinner, has been used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for about 20 years to lower cholesterol and other fats in the blood. Some laboratory reports have indicated it deters the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> maintains the right to deny any shipments into the county. It changed its policy in part because some AIDS treatments were coming in as contraband. `` All of us are dealing with a time line that is fierce,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He said some of the drugs have been shown to help combat the disease, which is spread most often through sexual contact, needles shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring. Despite the change, some still accused the government of failing to do enough to permit the use of drugs to help treat AIDS victims. `` He announced the policy because he heard there were going to be protests and he wanted to placate us,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. `` But we're not going to be placated with just dribs and drabs.'' Homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the 68,220 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases counted by the government since June 1981. There have been 38,541 deaths, or 56 percent of total cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported last week.

<HEAD>Four Blacks Killed, 12 Police Injured In Roadblock Confrontation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities said today that police killed four suspected guerrillas who threw grenades that injured 12 officers when a weapons-packed car was stopped at a roadblock near <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. Police said that when the car was stopped Sunday on the road between <LOCATION> Mafikeng </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lichtenburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, two hand grenades were thrown from it at security force members manning the roadblock. Five officers were hurt and police opened fire at the vehicle, killing two black men and a black woman, police said. Another black man was taken a short distance from the roadblock to be searched and was shot to death when he primed a hand grenade, police said. When the man fell on the grenade it detonated, injuring another seven officers, police added. None of the 12 officers were seriously injured, police said. Police said <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, automatic weapons, detonators and hand grenades were found in the car. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has repeatedly accused <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> of allowing guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to infiltrate <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from its territory. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> denies the charge and says most bombings and sabotage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are carried out by people in the country. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has made several raids into <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, attacking what it says are targets of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government and replace it with majority rule.

 An out of control stock car flew through a fence and into the bleachers during a race, killing one spectator and injuring 13 others, authorities said. The driver, who estimated he was traveling at 50 mph, was able to walk away from Sunday's crash at <ORGANIZATION> Lakeside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speedway </ORGANIZATION>. The car, which landed in an open space between the guard rails and the grandstands after tearing through a chain link fence, `` looked like it had gone through a compactor,'' said Lakeside police Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>. Those injured were sitting in the front row, said spectator <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> of <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>. Another race driver, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, said he was about five lengths behind the car driven by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> when <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> lost control. `` He hit the wall and got airborne,'' said Cash. `` I looked again and it -LRB- the car -RRB- just went around like a helicopter.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, 22, got out and walked away after the crash, <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> was taken to a hospital shaken but uninjured, authorities said. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said the track was slick. `` The car got loose and tagged the guardrail. I got a little too close to the guardrail,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 26, of suburban <LOCATION> Arvada </LOCATION>, was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> late Sunday, said spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shook </PERSON>. Twelve others were injured and taken to hospitals, but only a 4-year-old girl with a broken arm and head injuries was admitted for observation. The accident occurred midway through the 25-lap main event on the fifth-mile paved oval, Cash said. Lakeside is a tiny incorporated town between <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wheat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> with a population of about 15 residents.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s attorney general vowed to remove `` bad elements'' from the federal police and conduct a full investigation into the deaths of a TV anchorwoman and two other people by police machine-gun fire. `` We're not going to stop fighting corruption. We're going to clean up the police force,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said during a visit to this city on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border to initiate an investigation into the shootings. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>, 28, co-anchor for XHIJ-TV of <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>; her mother-in-law, <PERSON> Lucrecia </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, 58; and family friend <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 25, were gunned down in their car about 3 a.m. Saturday by men identifying themselves as <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>'s husband and co-anchor, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, was in the car but escaped injury by lying on the floor. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officer and three officers on the city police force were arrested, according to <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s government news agency <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the three were `` madrinas,'' underlings who work illegally for members of the elite federal force. Though illegal, the use of madrinas reportedly is widespread in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>. The `` officers,'' lured by the chance to work with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s highest police agency and carry automatic weapons, often have little or no training City police Chief <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> later denied the three were on the city police force. If an investigation determines the three are not commissioned officers, they will face charges of usurpation of police powers as well as of homicide, District Attorney <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> suspended the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> pending an investigation, and said he wanted the use of madrinas to end. `` I am absolutely against that corrupt and dishonest practice,'' he said. `` My indignation is great. ... `` The bad elements -LRB- in the federal force -RRB- will be removed. There are good elements in the force, ones who devote their lives to it. That is n't the case in this instance. But the bad agents will be removed. We wo n't let this blow over.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Armendariz </PERSON>, acting head of the Juarez detachment of the federal police, said the four detainees mistook the victims' car for one involved in a police shootout two hours earlier on a highway south of <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>. Occupants of the first car were suspected of being drug traffickers. Police said they found the abandoned car Saturday afternoon in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, with bullet holes in the rear window and more than 80 pounds of cocaine stashed in the trunk. There were no arrests. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said he, his wife and the two others were returning from a birthday party when men identifying themselves as <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> shouted to him to pull over. He said he did n't because he was afraid the men would search his car and steal $ 12,000 cash he had just collected for doing publicity for a traveling circus. In the last six years, there have been more than 20 unsolved killings of Mexican journalists. Journalistic groups allege that some of the reporters were killed in revenge for their work or to silence them. But reporters at <ORGANIZATION> XHIJ </ORGANIZATION> said neither <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> nor Ms. <PERSON> Berajano </PERSON> were known for exposing drug traffickers or government corruption. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> reporters Sunday night and asked them to support his efforts to seek justice. He said he feared for his two daughters and himself because he believed at least one gunman remained free. `` I want to ask you to help me to demand that they not permit this -LRB- deed -RRB- to be forgotten,'' he said. The three deaths prompted <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Baeza </PERSON> to buy advertisements of sympathy in Sunday's Juarez newspapers. At the funeral home where the bodies of Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> lay, hundreds of mourners streamed in all day Sunday. More than 40 large wreaths lined the walls of the viewing chapel.

 A cold front pushed showers and thunderstorms through the drought-plagued central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early today after lashing several Midwestern states with large hail and strong winds that ripped down trees and power lines. The storm system swept over southeastern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, northeastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and from eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to western lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> early today. Showers and thunderstorms also extended from southeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to southwestern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> into western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Uehling </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION> were pelted by hail the size of golf balls. The storms also whipped winds to 73 mph at <LOCATION> Brainard </LOCATION> and downed trees at <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the large hail struck areas north of <LOCATION> Rhinelander </LOCATION> and high winds ripped down trees and power lines at <LOCATION> Sheboygan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a dispatcher of the <ORGANIZATION> Calhoun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said hail covered parts of the city Sunday night `` The ground was completely white,'' she said.

The store was closed at the time and there were no reported injuries. A night of heavy rains may have caused the section of roof _ approximately 65 feet long and 10 feet wide _ to cave in, police said. Early today, a few showers lingered along a cold front in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Strikes Said To End In Disputed Region, Though Some Fight On</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Ethnic Armenians in the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region went back to tending fields, driving buses and building homes today after their two-month strike failed to bring unity with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, state-run media reported. An end to the latest strike in the predominantly Armenian enclave of the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> would signal a step toward normalcy for an area in tumult since February. Still, a resident in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s capital, said some of the region's 162,000 people will press on with the annexation campaign. `` Today people went to work. Transport is operating and we have ended our strikes,'' reported the engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. She declined to give her name. `` The situation is still very tense,'' she said by telephone. `` The decision has done little for us and we will continue this fight to the end. But what is the sense of continuing to strike?'' The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership decided a week ago that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> will remain part of the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which has ruled it since 1923. <PERSON> Nagorno-Karabh </PERSON>'s Armenians, predominantly Christian like their brethren in the neighboring Armenian republic, have waged a vocal campaign for annexation. They contend they suffer discrimination under the Azeris, most of whom are Moslem. The annexation drive was opposed by the Azerbaijani leadership, and the struggle over control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has fueled ethnic tensions in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. Mass demonstrations by Armenians in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> have drawn hundreds of thousands of people. And on Feb. 28, the unrest became violent when 26 Armenians and six other people were killed in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. After <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s rejection of the annexation bid became known in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> last week, activists called for a five-day protest strike. But most residents heeded official warnings against prolonging the labor unrest. Strikes continued in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> through the weekend, but state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported today that most workers in the region had decided to end the stoppage. Neither Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> nor the engineer reached in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> explained why residents decided to return to work, and other calls to the region did not go through. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership met Sunday and that local officials were blamed for allowing the annexation drive to get out of hand. Party leaders said `` the situation that has shaped in the republic over the recent months has been a result of gross miscalculations and errors in the political, organizational and ideological work of party committees, of primary party organizations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Adhering to the tougher stance against ethnic strife outlined by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a speech a week ago, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Armenian party leadership `` failed to sense the political danger of unjustifiable calls for revision of the existing national-territorial structure.'' Pravda, the party's central newspaper, also criticized Armenian party leaders who took up the cause of annexing the region, calling for review and rectification of their `` political immaturity.''

<HEAD>Scriptwriters, Producers Talks Recess; More Scheduled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A negotiating session between striking scriptwriters and producers recessed early today after nearly 13 hours, but more talks to end the 20-week-old strike were scheduled, union officials said. The session between the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> began about 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the Sherman Oaks headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> and was monitored by a federal mediator. The talks recessed at 2:15 a.m. today but were scheduled to resume at 3 p.m., said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, a guild spokeswoman. `` We went to the meeting prepared to negotiate in good faith in order to reach a fair deal to both sides,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, executive director of the guild's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> unit, said in a taped message to members. `` We're committed to do that and to continue the process.'' The session that ended early today followed a 13-hour round of talks Saturday. That was the first time the two sides had conducted formal talks in more than a month. Guild President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said union negotiators were prepared for any new development that may arise, but refused to elaborate, citing a news blackout agreed upon by both sides at the request of federal mediator <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>. Previous talks ended in June with scriptwriters coast-to-coast overwhelmingly rejecting a compromise offer from producers. Since the strike began March 7, the main sticking point has been the share of money writers make when hour-long television shows go into reruns. Despite some internal dissention, the 9,000-plus member guild has remained firm in its demand for a bigger cut of the so-called residual profits, and has divided producers' ranks by getting some independent filmmakers to defect, allowing them to hire writers under separate contracts granting guild demands. The strike has slowed down the entertainment industry and resulted in layoffs. Television networks, their fall schedules in shambles, have insisted they will broadcast new fall programming even if they have to refilm old scripts with new actors.

 A 25-year-old man who apparently thought his girlfriend was refusing to answer her door tried to enter from a window ledge and fell seven stories to his death, police said. But neither the girl nor her father, with whom she lived, was home at the time, said Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasen </PERSON>. He said the victim, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, quarreled with his girlfriend earlier in the day Sunday. `` So he went up to the apartment and, we think, he knocked on the door and when he got no answer figured she was trying to avoid him,'' <PERSON> Chasen </PERSON> said. `` So he tried to be sneaky.'' <PERSON> Chasen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> crawled out on a narrow ledge and tried to get to a window of his girlfriend's apartment, but fell into a parking lot, landing near a car and setting off the auto's theft alarm. A building custodian heard the alarm and called police.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Communists Losing War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today said the 19-year-old communist insurgency is finally losing steam and declared that the rebels' rejection of peace gives her government `` the moral basis for war.'' `` This may be remembered as the year the insurgency was broken,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a nationally televised `` state of the nation address''. As the president spoke, about 3,000 leftists rallied at a downtown square about six miles away and burned placards showing her wearing military fatigues. Speakers claimed the government had failed to live up to its promises of land reform and social justice. `` For the armed left, it has been a year of defeats and retreats; a year of propaganda by terror rather than the strategic initiative of which it had boasted,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. She made no direct reference to a call this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to resume peace talks, which collapsed in January 1987. The president vowed her government would keep open `` the door of reconciliation'' but added: `` The rejection of our peace efforts restored to government the moral basis for war. `` I wish we could still pursue the path of peace,'' she added. `` Yet, until the -LRB- rebels -RRB- and their friends come to trust their doctrines to the ballot box rather than the -LRB- rifle -RRB-, government has no choice but to defend our people with the gun.'' Last week, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she was willing to resume peace talks but only if the rebels request them first. The general command of the 25,000-member <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rejected the call, saying the government simply wants to entrap guerrilla leaders. During the address, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said democracy `` is beating back the challenge of the totalitarian left.'' She called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pursue an agenda to alleviate foreign debt, improve education, create new jobs and reduce poverty. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> claimed that in the past year, government troops captured five members of the Communist party central committee, 19 staff officers, 397 regulars and killed about 2,000 party members. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement issued before the speech, said the president's remarks were simply `` an apology to the nation. `` The real state of the nation is lived with each passing day,'' the party said. `` It is experienced by each hungry family; it is witnessed by each hungry family; it is witnessed by each negotiation selling out to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases; and it is echoed by each cry of protest that is snuffed out by bullets.'' Opposition Rep. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Escuerdo </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s optimisic assessment of the counter-insurgency campaign shows she is not receiving realistic reports from the military. `` I'm a bit worried that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is not getting the correct data from her officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Escuerdo </PERSON> said. `` Without peace and order, we can not really hope for an economic miracle or recovery.'' On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said a classified military report prepared in May showed government forces lost 66 of the 67 major battles against the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> during the first three months of the year. The newspaper also said the report showed that rebel strength in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> had grown to 2,700, the highest number since the insurgency began in December 1968. Chief military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> admitted that the newspaper account was based on an internal, classified report but said its findings were purely `` tactical'' and incomplete.

<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> has gone the way of many disgruntled workers, declaring a strike, a picket line and erecting protest placards against unfair labor practices. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, sewing and driving her children to summer activities were among the tasks she refused to do during her walkout, which appears to be entering its second week today. Mrs. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, 42, said she's protesting her motherly duties because she felt she was being taken for granted. Her husband, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON>, pitched in and helped her with the signs that were draped on the front porch. The family could not be reached Sunday by telephone, but the protest placards were still in view and Mrs. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said Saturday during an interview she would pursue her walkout at least through a second week. Neighbors said the <PERSON> Schultes </PERSON> appeared to be away for the day, leading to speculation that some heavy collective bargaining might be going on. Hand-painted signs on the front of the frame dwelling read: `` Mom On Strike'' and `` Union + Labor = Teenagers.'' `` I do n't expect it to change overnight,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said Saturday. `` I'm going to last another week, but if it goes another month I do n't really care.'' A cardboard fence marked a picket line, serving notice to her four children to use the back door. `` I became too much of a mother, too much of a chauffeur,'' she said. `` I just began doing too much for them and they were n't giving me anything. There was constant squabbling about making beds and doing dishes, she said. `` I said I do n't have enough money to go to a counselor, and these things are too small anyway, but if I let them go, I'm going to have a lot of problems,'' she said. She and her husband made signs that were posted inside the house. When the children only `` thought it was cool,'' she decided to go public. The campaign began July 18 with no meals, no money from mother's pocket for milk and no rides to work Their telephone was disconnected. Television and radio were taken to `` strike headquarters'' in the parents' bedroom. No teen-ager friends were allowed to cross the picket line. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said he supported his wife 100 percent and was acting as strike mediator. The children, twins <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, 14; <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, 8, gave the strike mixed reviews. `` I feel embarrassed because everyone is asking me about it,'' <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> said, `` but we're going to have to make a change because we do n't want her on strike anymore. She has a point, but I think she went about it the wrong way.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, who promised to spend an afternoon making his bed and cleaning his room, the living room and the bathroom, said: `` Some people are saying good for Mom.'' `` I say good for Mom, too.'' By the weekend, Mrs. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> reported progress but that talks had yet to produce a settlement. `` I love them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said of her children. `` I just want them to look at themselves and see that they do n't have it so tough at my house. When they start doing these things, I'll go off strike.'' Meanwhile, she said, `` I'm having the time of my life.''

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which once called the situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> `` irreversible,'' held its first peace talks today with leaders of three guerrilla groups fighting its decade-old occupation of that country. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> searched for compromise in an opulent reception room at the late President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>'s summer palace with the guerrilla leaders and foreign ministers of non-communist nations that back them. The informal `` cocktail party'' talks were n't confirmed until the last minute, but they have raised hopes for ending a monotonous cycle of dashed diplomatic moves followed by bloody fighting in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s malarial jungles. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> maintains more than 100,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to support a government it installed after invading the country on Christmas Day, 1978. Around tables arranged in a circle sat Thach; <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of the Vietnamese-installed government; a representative of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s communist ally, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>; and the guerrilla leaders: <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, who is representing his father, prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The guerrillas are grouped in a resistance coalition that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> recognizes as <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s legitimate government. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> of host <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> moderated the talks, also attended by senior foreign ministry officials of the other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations: <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. The association has called <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> the region's major security threat during the past decade. The parties all sat quietly in the carpeted, double-chandeliered room as waves of journalists and photographers were rushed in for a glimpse. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> appeared bemused, and the affable <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> chatted and tried to ease some of the stiffness of the first encounter. No definite schedule has been fixed for the duration of the talks. For years, <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> was a tough hardliner who knew only the language of defiance. Over the past 1 -LCB- years, however, he has vigorously pushed for dialogue as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pragmatic new leadership focuses on economic development, which it admits requires an end to the international isolation <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has caused <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. For years, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has encouraged the guerrillas to force <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The association became more anxious for talks as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> began withdrawing large numbers of troops and pledged a total pullout by early 1990, suggesting it fears the pullout may leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with a much more chaotic and bloodier civil war. Earlier today, the Cambodian factions held their own separate talks, the first time they had ever gathered together. <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> has outlined the formidable task the parties face: they have to find common ground on power-sharing, self-determination, national reconciliation, the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Senn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> have held two rounds of talks without success in the past, and today's gathering represented the first meeting among all four <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> parties. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, meanwhile, was visiting <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> capital just 40 miles from <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, but had no known plans to attend the talks. An <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> source said the former <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> monarch might make an appearance in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, depending on progress in the talks. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> resigned as president of the guerrilla coalition, charging the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was killing his men. The talks are based on a July 1987 <LOCATION> Vietnam-Indonesia </LOCATION> agreement that calls for informal discussions to encourage the various antagonists to participate and allay <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s refusal to negotiate directly with the guerrillas. Disputes between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> delayed the talks, which were not confirmed until the last minute. The association includes the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Since 1970, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has suffered a devastating five-year civil war, a reign of terror by the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1978, a 1978 Vietnamese invasion and a continuing guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed government. Millions of people have been killed in the turmoil. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has announced it will withdraw 50,000 troops, or about half its force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, this year and the rest by early 1990. Though Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> are allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in a resistance coalition, they strongly distrust the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Parties that formed Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON>'s last coalition government won 58 percent of the vote in a general election, but analysts predicted today that <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s probable return to power will be beset by discord `` The new government will face the same difficult problems it endured under <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s last administration because there is growing and open resentment of and opposition to <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>,'' said political scientist <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON> <PERSON> Suksamran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chulalongkorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Since no pro-Prem party scored a majority in Sunday's polling, the next government will again have to be made up of several parties. In <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s last government, frictions among coalition partners proved troublesome. <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON> and other political analysts predicted that <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, if he is returned to power, probably would not finish his four-year term without dissolving parliament or stepping down. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> has served as prime minister since 1980, having dissolved parliament twice, survived two attempted coups and formed five different cabinets. A host of domestic pressures have been mounting, including weakened support from the powerful military, sharp criticism from opposition parties and recent labor and student protests. `` These pressures will only get more intense and will very likely force Prem to make big decisions on whether he should cling to his office,'' <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But the head of Chart Thai -LRB- Thai Nation -RRB- Party, which polled the most votes in the country's 17th general election, said his party would support <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s continuation as prime minister. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> told reporters today that a `` gentlemen's agreement'' had been made among the four coalition partners to back Prem The well-financed Chart Thai won 87 seats in the 357-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> while coalition partners accumulated another 123. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took 54; <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, 48; and Rassadorn -LRB- Citizens -RRB- Party 21 seats. The strongest parties and other power centers in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in coming days are expected to engage in intense politicking and bargaining before the next coalition is forged and a prime minister named. The candidate who emerges must also be approved by <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s powerful constitutional monarch, <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON> Interior Minister <PERSON> Prachuab </PERSON> <PERSON> Soontrangkul </PERSON> announced that 16.9 million out of an eligible 26.6 million voters turned out for the election. The voting was marred by a grenade attack against a local politician in which two persons were killed and six others wounded. Officials also said Moslem separatists set fire to nine rural schools, a health clinic and a rest house in the southern province of <LOCATION> Narathiwat </LOCATION> in an apparent attempt to disrupt the elections. Some of the schools were used as polling stations. A total of 3,606 candidates from 16 political parties contested the seats in the lower house of Parliament. Among the opposition groups, the Prachakorn Thai -LRB- Thai Citizens -RRB- Party led with 31 seats and the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Palang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dharma </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virtue </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- captured 14. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> called the election 24 months early after he dissolved parliament April 29, disbanding his coalition government and nullifying a no-confidence motion tabled by his increasingly vocal opposition. The 67-year-old former army chief has maintained silence over whether he would accept another term, but most analysts believe he would. Thai elections are largely centered on personalities, not political platforms, and the main contention has been whether Prem should return or not. Some people call the low-key prime minister `` Papa Prem;'' others criticize him as `` boring,'' quick to compromise and slow to tackle national problems. But Prem, the longest-serving prime minister in modern <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> history, has given the country a needed stability after years of coups and attempted power grabs. Although his coalition has been beset by factionalism, he remains favored by three powerful institutions: the military, bureaucracy and constitutional monarchy.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s rival political parties agreed today to present a unified response to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s call last week for joint parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact. Representatives of the south's four political parties met at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and agreed to send by Aug. 1 a letter responding to the call. Party officials said the groups would continue talks this week to solve minor differences over details such as the agenda and the site for the talks. `` There were no striking differences, although no agreement was reached,'' said an aide to National Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jai-soon </PERSON>, who presided over today's meeting. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s political parties have been engaged in talks since deciding on Friday to consider the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> proposal. South Korean government officials have been reluctant to agree to immediate full-scale parliamentary talks, saying preliminary negotiations are needed for such conferences. The two Koreas, divided since 1945, have been locked in a struggle for supremacy on the divided peninsula. The north has refused to accept recent South Korean proposals on easing tension.

 Bus crashes in two states took the life of one woman and injured 69 passengers, with the driver of one being charged with reckless driving and the other being praised for stopping his skidding bus from plunging into a ravine. A Colonial Trailways bus en route from Mobile to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sunday swerved to avoid a car apparently driving on the wrong side of a two-lane <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> highway. The bus skidded for about 30 feet after it overturned and came to a stop with the back of the bus in a shallow part of the ravine and the front jutting about 15 feet in the air. The accident, three miles south of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, killed <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> troopers, and left 34 other people injured. In <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a charter bus driver was charged with reckless driving after his bus crashed into a bridge abutment, shearing off most of the roof and injuring 35 passengers who had just left a family reunion. One was still in critical condition this morning. Edison Police Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> said the bus, which originated in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, struck the abutment of a railroad bridge Sunday afternoon. The bus carried 46 passengers and the driver, <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> said. The driver, 43-year-old <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lassiter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was issued a summons for careless driving, <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lassiter </PERSON>, a driver for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>, failed to observe a sign warning of low bridge clearance and was driving above the speed limit, he said. State Police Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the driver of the bus involved in the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> accident said he had swerved to avoid an oncoming car. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that was under investigation. State police spokesman <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the bus was carrying 34 passengers and the bus driver. Four people were hospitalized overnight for observation. Passenger <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> sergeant, credited the driver for keeping the bus from plunging into the ravine. `` I thought the driver did an outstanding job in the way he handled the bus,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` It might have been a lot worse for us.''

 The spiritual leader of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists believed to be holding foreigners hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has called for a new approach to the crisis that would bring a `` happy ending.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, the spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, made the comments in a sermon Sunday as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> prepared to enter U.N.-sponsored talks to end its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of using the hostage crisis for political purposes. But he also called for a swift resolution to the problem. `` We call for a just and practical solution to ths problem to achieve a happy ending,'' he said. `` We are aware that the -LRB- hostages -RRB- problem has reached such a degree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed up with its humanitarian aspect.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine Americans are among the captives. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s comments came during a one-hour sermon to Shiites marking the major Moslem feast of al-Adha in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> mosque. The hostages are widely believed to be held in <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madi </LOCATION> barracks building about 10 blocks from the mosque in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern suburbs <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has had some 5,000 troops patrolling most of the southern suburbs since May 27, but they have stayed away from the immediate area of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontation that could imperil the hostages. Syrian soldiers, however, control all approaches to <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and man high-rise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks. It was not clear whether <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s call signaled a breakthrough for the hostages. He has made similar statements in the past two years with no results. `` On the occasion of this feast, we call on all sides to begin acting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect of this problem could be resolved,'' he said. `` We feel pain for the detention -LRB- of the hostages -RRB- because the issue has humanitarian aspects,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and European nations of `` manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons to impose their dominance on the world. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather used it as a means of political pressure on each country and people that resist its imperlialist policies,'' he added. It was <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s first reference to the hostages issue since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced July 18 that it was accepting the year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Political observers believe a truce could facilitate efforts for the release of the hostages. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' said Sunday that improved U.S.-Iranian relations could lead to the release of the American hostages On the terms of a release, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, `` We're obviously not going to discuss any quid pro quo, but if the Iranians want to talk to us about the hostage situation and how they're going to go about influencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it. I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy.'' `` We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` All they have to do is designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and we'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, about terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever is appropriate.'' The longest held hostages is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eeast </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was seized March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, reached by telephone Sunday at her home in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said, `` I do n't see that it -LRB- the holding of hostages -RRB- should be a political issue. It's a human issue. `` Everything I've been hearing out of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> lately gives us reason to hope and it's been a very, very long time since we've had occasion to be hopeful.''

<HEAD>Future Looks Murky for Elusive Piglet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owner of a 40-pound pet piglet that eluded police for three hours until it paused for a handful of horse feed was told his porker may be killed if it is n't picked up within five days. But <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON>'s owner, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 32, will be in the <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail until at least Aug. 5, when he's scheduled to appear before a judge on a parole violation charge, his mother said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was notified Saturday that the 8-month-old pig will be `` terminated'' if it is n't claimed in five days, said his mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. She said she would take the pig into her suburban home, but `` you know what the neighbors would say.'' She's hoping some farmer will come to the porker's rescue. <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON>'s brush with the law began Thursday when police stopped <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and a computer check showed he was wanted for violating probation on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON> slipped out of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s arms and made a clean getaway. Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> and another officer spent the next few hours pursuing <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON> until a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> agricultural unit was called in for assistance. Deputy <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> `` Hi-Ho'' <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON> used a handful of horse feed to stop and capture <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON>, who was sent off to a Sheriff's Office facility. Sheriff's Office spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> said he was not sure what the guidelines on animals called for, but he noted that in many livestock cases, the animals were kept for a specific time and then auctioned. `` The last thing I heard ... was that this was a pet, that we have his pet and that we would keep the pig until it is claimed,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s mother said her son, who has always liked pigs, received <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON> from a friend as payment for a plumbing job. She said he intended to give the pig to relatives who live on a farm.

 A Soviet general says he doubts Afghan troops can survive when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdraws from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He also predicts that Islamic fundamentalists will seize power. The statements by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON>, who was once an adviser to the Afghans, represent a break with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s official line. In an interview with the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling party is hopelessly disorganized, plagued by corruption and has bungled opportunities to make peace with insurgents. He also accuses the Soviet media of exaggerating Soviet and Afghan military victories. The interview appeared in the magazine's July 30 issue, which subscribers received Sunday. Western military and political analysts have said for some time they doubt the Afghan army can fight off U.S.-backed rebels on its own. They have predicted a collapse of the communist Afghan government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after the Soviet pullout is completed next year. <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON>, who teaches philosophy at a military academy, is believed to be the first Soviet official to make similar predictions publicly. <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> has led the campaign for glasnost, or greater openness, on selected topics. The official Soviet line has held that Afghan government forces are well prepared to defend their country. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, commander of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month that the Afghan government has created an effective fighting force. Asked if he is confident Afghan forces can provide adequate defense from rebel attacks after a Soviet withdrawal, <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON> told Ogonyok: `` If you judge the Afghan army by its current state, then I do n't have the confidence about which you speak.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began withdrawing its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> May 15. Under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord, half of the more than 100,000 troops must be out by mid-August and the rest by Feb. 15. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Saturday that more than 35,000 soldiers have been withdrawn. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is coming under increasing guerrilla artillery fire. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> says he is counting on the continued help of Soviet advisers for his 50,000 regular army troops after the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s forces are gone. He has said his forces can defend the country as long as outside assistance to the rebels is stopped. <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON> noted that Afghan forces, even when backed by Soviet troops, have made little headway in capturing rebel-held territory. He said official Soviet press reports exaggerated military victories and suffered from a `` deficit of truth'' about how tough the combat was. The Aghan army is weak, he said, because the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the government lack popular support and have underestimated the threat of the armed opposition He recommended the government devote massive resources to building up the army. Asked what the situation would be like when the Soviet withdrawal is completed, he predicted `` activization of the Islamic factor.'' `` In the future, it's quite possible that Islamic fundamentalists will appear,'' he said. Some Afghan guerrillas want to establish an Islamic fundamentalist state. <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON> said the Afghan leadership had been insensitive to religion and thereby alienated much of the population, drawing them to the opposition. He said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s policy of national reconciliation, an attempt to bring opponents into the government, has failed even though internal opponents are tired of war, willing to engage in dialogue and hostile to the seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` This also can be considered a lost opportunity of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> leadership,'' <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON> said. He said the ruling Afghan party is split into factions, pays little attention to people's needs and is plagued by bureaucracy and bribery. `` I fear that the disease of fractional battle and system of clans in the party has gone too far,'' <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON> said. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government fight the rebels. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says 13,310 Soviet soldiers have been killed in the war, 35,500 have been wounded and more than 300 are missing in action. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today that since May rebel forces have bombarded <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with 178 rockets and 30 mines, killing 154 people and wounding 205 in the Afghan capital.

<HEAD>Official Says Sub Crew Should Have Done More to Rescue Boat
Passengers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top defense official said today that the crew of a navy submarine that hit and sank a chartered fishing boat should have done more to rescue the 48 people on board and had been slow in notifying rescue officials. Divers, meanwhile, recovered the bodies of three more victims, bringing the confirmed death toll to nine in the accident Saturday near <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, 28 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. About 200 divers were searching today for the bodies of 21 people missing and presumed dead, rescue officials said. Other divers worked to attach cables to the hull of the sunken fishing vessel, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru. Officials said they plan to begin raising the ship with a giant crane Tuesday. Witnesses said the fishing boat, which had been chartered by a company club for a weekend trip, sank less than two minutes after colliding with the 2,200-ton submarine Nadashio at the entrance to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The submarine, traveling on the surface, was crossing a busy shipping lane to enter <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> naval base. Nineteen people were rescued from the boat. One of them died later in a hospital. `` The investigation is n't complete yet, but it looks like both vessels were partly responsible for the accident,'' an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard, said. There were no reports of injuries among the 75 men aboard the submarine, which was only slightly damaged. <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON>, vice minister of state for defense, said the submarine had been slow in notifying rescue officials of the accident because its communications equipment allowed it to talk to naval headquarters, but not directly to the coast guard. News reports said 21 minutes elapsed before the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> was informed of the collision. Of the 19 people who were rescued, 16 were picked up by other passing ships and only three by the submarine, the reports said. <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON> said he wished members of the crew `` had grabbed three or four life preservers, if they were available, and jumped into the water'' to save the people in the ocean. Witnesses from other boats said they saw a number of people who had been floating in the water after the accident sink out of sight. Admiral <PERSON> Shuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON>, navy chief of staff, was quoted as saying Sunday that the submarine was trying to avoid hitting a yacht when it rammed the fishing boat, and that the accident could have been avoided if the fishing boat had not made an unexpected turn. `` If the No. 1 <PERSON> Fujimaru </PERSON> had not turned to the left, there would not have been a collision. I do n't know why they turned. I believe the submarine commander took the most appropriate measures to avoid an accident,'' a <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> official quoted him as saying. According to Japanese maritime regulations, the vessel approaching from the left when two boats are on a collision course must take evasive action, while the other vessel must maintain its direction unless an accident is imminent. In Saturday's accident, the submarine was on the left, <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON> said. The collision was the worst involving Japanese navy vessels and civilian boats since World War II, defense officials said. It was the first collision in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> between a submarine and a Japanese civilian ship since 1981, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear submarine hit a freighter, killing two people, the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Marshall Center Will Test-fire Experimental Shuttle Engines</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Space Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Full-scale test-firing of experimental space shuttle engines will begin here in September for the first time since the initial development program about 20 years ago, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineering officials said. Resumption of the experimental activity will increase morale at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, one engineer said. `` We've had a lot of passive tests, structural tests, but there was n't any fire and smoke,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Toopen </PERSON> said last week. `` You put in a lot of long, hard hours and the results of it all is that you get to see it here in your own back yard.'' The tests will look at `` new technology items'' for shuttle engine improvement, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, chief of the advanced engine development branch of the shuttle main engine office. Engineers plan to use a 20-story rocket-testing stand that was last used almost two decades ago to test-fire <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> moon rocket stages. The Marshall center, which is responsible for developing and managing the $ 40 million main shuttle engines, will use the stand to fire engines for up to 150 seconds at a time. Engineers are seeking ways to make the expensive engines more economical. The major components of the shuttle's main engines now are replaced after three or four flights. `` These test firings will be a series of prototypes of advanced engines to see if components can last longer than we think,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, chief of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s engineering propulsion lab. If so, <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said, the price of the engines might be reduced to about $ 20 million in about 10 years. The test firing program will cost about $ 15 million to $ 20 million annually. <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said there has been little or no test firing to try new ideas since initial engine development in the early 1970s. `` The way it has been, we've had ideas, done the design work, then had to go to a launch -LRB- at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- to watch it work,'' <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said. `` This way it's next door.''

On Sunday, a four-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team arrived in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to begin discussing a key technical elements of a truce: the trade of prisoners of war. A second <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team was scheduled to arrive soon in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to work out other details of a cease-fire. Interviewed today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' Iranian and Iraqi diplomats charged each other's countries with violating the spirit of the prospective truce. `` At the last minute they want to capture some of our land when we have already removed the excuse for the Iraqis,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately it has been <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that has always sabotaged efforts of the secretary-general to implement -LRB- U.N. Resolution 598 -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Anbari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, criticized <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for waiting a year to accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution `` and coupled with that, of course, all threats and call for mobilization and asking the Iranian people to go to the front to continue the war against what they call the enemy.'' `` We are interested in lasting, comprehensive peace, not just a cease-fire to enable the Iranians to mobilize and ... wage another human offensive whenever they would like,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had `` doubled his popularity'' by accepting the cease-fire, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> met with a group of visitors who chanted `` Please God Keep Khomeini Alive'' and `` We Are All Your Soldiers, We Will Obey Your Orders.'' The radio said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> responded by waving his hand. He apparently did not speak. Ardebili urged a huge turnout at rallies planned for Aug. 2 to demonstrate allegiance to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the patriarch of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 9-year-old Islamic revolution <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> already has accepted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, which calls for return to previous borders and a prisoner exchange. According to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> figures, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has about 50,000 Iraqi POWs and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> held 13,000 Iranian soldiers before the latest raid. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Sunday that it had boosted its bargaining position by seizing 8,636 additional enemy fighters during its push into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that began Friday. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has said taking a large number of prisoners would help in peace negotiations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today the Iraqis still were occupying 1,500 square miles of Iranian soil on the central front, 190 square miles in the central-southern region and 19 square miles in the south. Interviewed Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he hoped hostilities would cease when he began discussions with representatives of the two nations. Asked if talks would be held face-to-face, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said: `` My idea is to discuss separately with both sides. Of course, I will be only too pleased if, at some stage, I could have the two sides together.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it wants to hold direct negotiations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initially refused, but later indicated it might agree to them at <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s request.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for the first time since winning the Democratic nomination, was greeted wuth cheers today when he walked into his Statehouse office. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, was getting mixed reviews as he sought to shore up support among women. About 20 workers in the executive chamber cheered and applauded as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arrived at work at 8:50 a.m. today. He grinned and bowed and then spoke briefly to them before heading into his office. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, returning Sunday night from a three-day campaign trip, was greeted warmly by about 150 people in soggy weather at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, traveled to five states, including the key fall battlegrounds of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They set off on their initial campaign trip last week, just after accepting their respective nominations at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The Republicans, meanwhile, were looking ahead to their own convention, which opens three weeks from today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, was back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today after spending five days on the road. His campaigning between now and the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gathering will be curtailed because he has spent nearly the legal limit for pre-convention campaigning. But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> probably will campaign in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf between now and the convention. That word came from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was flying back from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Air Force One. Also aboard was Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who had been in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a weekend fund-raiser, and his presence fueled new speculation about an imminent departure from the administration to run <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had `` a very brief chat'' with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and added: `` He's still treasury secretary, put it that way.'' When reporters sent <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> a note asking him to come back and talk to them about the matter, he sent back a dollar bill and suggested that reporters take a close look at the banknote bearing his signature. `` Please note the title under the signature,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wrote. That title, of course, is secretary of the treasury. Later, asked by reporters to `` share the news,'' he responded: `` There's no news to share.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s status is n't the only source of speculation surrounding the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. The vice president traveled to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, on Sunday with former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who has been mentioned as a potential running mate. But campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't reveal his choice of a running mate until next month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` He's going to keep his own counsel on it, and he's going to let us all know at the convention,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said Sunday in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Face the Nation.'' He added that he thought an announcement then would be `` very exciting and very dramatic.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> to speak to an organization of professional and business women, unveiled an ambitious $ 2.2 billion child-care plan that would be phased in over four years. The group's president, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON>, welcomed the plan but tempered her praise by calling it `` one of his first concrete gestures'' toward women When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished speaking, many in the audience broke into chants of `` E-R-A'' _ a reference to the Equal Rights Amendment, which the vice president opposes. He also was presented with a red purse, which organization members said signified the gap between the earnings of women and men. On another front, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview published in Newsday on Sunday that he would consider the creation of an international military force that could launch air strikes against foreign drug factories. `` If you can target a factory that was putting out this poison ... a factory of death ... that's poisoning kids, where a country needed assistance to wipe it out, I'd be very open-minded about that -LRB- air strikes -RRB-. We're talking about a war on drugs,'' he said in the interview. `` We have helicopters going in there right now, striking against crops,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` What's so different?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former chief of staff, retired Adm. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, raised the idea at a congressional hearing July 14. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, at the time called the suggestion `` pap and nonsense.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for his part, encountered anti-abortion protesters at a stop in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> on Sunday, as he had a day earlier in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The governor supports a woman's right to an abortion. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, a onetime rival for the Democratic nomination. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> accompanied them to the church he had attended since childhood. Later, the two made a stop in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued to stress the theme of economic opportunity and commitment to the family. After the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> stop, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was expected to campaign on his own later this week.

<HEAD>Police Kill Escaped Prisoner Sentenced In Sadat Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police today shot and killed a former army officer who escaped from prison while serving a life sentence in the assassination of President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, the government announced. <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Kemary </PERSON>, 37, a former major, was killed in a hail of gunfire when police attacked an apartment he and two other fugitives used as a hideout, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Two police officers were wounded when the police gunfire was returned with a volley of bullets and explosive charges from the hideout. Both officers were reported in satisfactory condition in a hospital, the ministry statement said. It was not clear whether the two other fugitives _ <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamis </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Aswani </PERSON>, 31 _ escaped before police stormed the apartment in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s el-Sharabiya district. In the apartment, the ministry said, police found plastic bombs. A ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said security forces were searching for the two other fugitives. Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said el-Kemary was `` by far the most dangerous'' of the three escapees. The dawn attack ended a nationwide manhunt that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> launched after el-Kemary and the two others, also serving life sentences in <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s killing, escaped July 17 from the maximum-security Tura jail on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. In the dawn jailbreak, the three men forced open their prison cell with an iron bar and overpowered the guards, seizing their rifles and knocking one man unconscious. The fugitives then shot their way out of the prison to a getaway car, police said. According to the government, the three men were members of a Moslem fundamentalist group known as Jihad, or Holy War. Jihad was blamed for <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s slaying at a military parade on Oct. 6, 1981, and a subsequent coup attempt. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s assassination sparked a security crackdown on Moslem extremists. After a series of trials, three convicted assassins were executed by firing squad, another two were hanged and more than 120 men were given prison terms up to life. El-Kemary, <PERSON> Khamis </PERSON> and el-Aswani were convicted of planning the assassination and the coup attempt, in addition to membership in an armed group _ <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> _ trying to disrupt the public order. The three did not actually shoot at <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> returned to state business today after winding up his first campaign swing as the Democratic presidential nominee by declaring his party the `` party of jobs ... the party of families.'' Staff members and other workers cheered and applauded as he walked into the executive chamber at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> today. The governor grinned, bowed and then talked briefly with the group before going into his office. He was greeted by about 150 supporters who chanted `` Let's Go Mike'' at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> late Sunday as he arrived home for the first time since claiming the Democratic banner last week in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He concluded a spirited three-day, cross-country series of campaign appearances with running mate Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Sunday by attacking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economic policies. `` We're going to win because we are the party of jobs,'' he told a rally at the last stop in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` We're going to win, my friends, because we're the party of families.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who touted his new alliance with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the five-state swing from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and back to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and planned to resume campaigning on his own in a few days. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was dogged by anti-abortion demonstrators throughout the day, beginning with a Sunday church service in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> where about 100 people protested his support of a woman's right to an abortion. Later in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, his route away from the airport was lined with nearly as many anti-abortion protesters. In Erie, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared with <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> in a downtown park where 4,000 to 5,000 people gathered on a hot and sunny afternoon. Citing the decline in steel industry jobs in the region, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared, `` We can turn things around, and we're going to do it. `` It's time to exchange voodoo for can-do,'' he said. `` It's time to exchange trickle-down for building up in this country, and we're going to do it. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went to services and spoke from the pulpit of the <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and former party rival Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. As they entered the downtown church, about 100 anti-abortion demonstrators across the street held up signs and chanted, `` Hey <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, how many babies did you kill today?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not acknowledge the protesters but later told reporters his position on abortion has been consistent for 25 years. `` It's a difficult, very serious, very important ethical and moral judgment,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference inside the church building. `` But in my judgment it is a woman, in the exercise of her conscience and religious beliefs, that has to make that judgment. `` The question is who makes the decision, and do we go back to the days when we branded a woman a criminal for making that decision,'' he added. `` I believe the vast majority of Americans do n't want to go back to those days. They think in the last analysis this is an issue of conscience.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went to the church to underscore a fundamental theme of his campaign i recent days, the commitment to family and community that he spoke of in his speech Thursday accepting his party's nomination `` The most important thing in my life is family,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the congregation. `` They are our anchors. They are the place in which we get our strength. It was our parents that gave us our sense of values, sense of ethics, our sense of morality,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, more conservative on many issues than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, did not face questioning on the abortion issue. However, spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> opposes federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a mother's life is endangered by the pregnancy.

 Heiress and designer <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> was trying to talk her despondent son out of killing himself when he jumped from a ledge at her 14th floor apartment and fell to his death, police said today. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 23, had been under treatment for depression over the past six months.

 Assailants shot and killed a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing today as Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, delivering a sermon a mile away, denounced Americans who `` romanticize violence'' in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, 33, was shot in the head as he answered a knock at his door from three men who apparently were dressed as policemen, police said. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and was wounded in an assassination attempt last year. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists for his killing. On Saturday, an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb killed a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> couple and their 6-year-old son as they were driving just north of the <LOCATION> Ireland-Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> border. The mostly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to drive <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the island, has accepted responsibility, saying it attacked the wrong car. Press reports say the intended victim was a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> judge. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> was shot at his home on Friendly Street as <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, leading a American peace pilgrims on a tour of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, was attending Mass with 400 congregants at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was told of <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s killing as he left <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Several hours later, the cardinal deplored the assassination in his sermon to an ecumenical service at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral in <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. He said the killing, along with Saturday's bombing, `` poignantly brought into focus the stupidity, the irrationality of the cycle of the violence ... Where can this conceivably end? How this can conceivably please almighty God?'' In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> criticized `` some on our own shores, some in my own country, who romanticize violence when it is several thousand miles away, who do n't know what it does to a land, who do n't know the insecurity that it brings, who do n't know how it keeps a people oppressed.'' The Catholic prelate developed the theme in <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, criticizing Americans who `` continue to perpetuate the myth that this violence reflects the glory of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, that we can stand around pianos and sing sentimental songs and believe that what occurs today is in the tradition of the martyrs and the saints. `` Is n't it time that we dispelled such myths? Is n't it time that we ... recognized that in the sight of almighty God, a Protestant, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, a Jew, a Moslem, a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, is a person of sacred worth?'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> urged Americans to heed his host in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, who `` has recognized that regardless of the motive or the alleged motive, violence, the murder of the innocent, is absolutely intolerably evil and can never be justified.'' The cardinal also backed <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>'s call to the British government for more funding to combat unemployment. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s Cathedral in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> overlooks the Divis Flats housing project, which <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> toured Sunday. He urged American business to create jobs and deprive the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> of recruits. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the hopelessness he encountered at Divis Flats, where the unemployment rate is 86 percent, `` grinds into my soul.'' `` I think it would be a tremendous contribution, if far more American industry were to invest over here,'' he said. The cardinal acknowledged that violence makes it hard to attract industry to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` Industry is not going to risk -LRB- coming here -RRB- if it feels it is going to be subjected to terrorist activity. So the wheel keeps turning,'' he said. During his visit to <PERSON> Divis </PERSON> <PERSON> Flats </PERSON>, he was surrounded by children, several of whom he asked to `` Give me five.'' While slapping hands with the prelate, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannin </PERSON>, 10, asked him `` What is a cardinal?.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> retorted with a laugh, `` It's a red bird.'' `` That was great for me,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> later told reporters. `` That reminds you it's all a lot of puffery. It brings you down to earth.''

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has told its auto dealers that prices for fleets of 1989-model cars will increase between 3 percent and 5 percent, a company spokesman said today. However, those tentative increases may not have a bearing on final retail prices, which are expected to be announced in August along with final fleet prices, said spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervone </PERSON>. Auto dealers frequently sign contracts to deliver new cars before the model year starts for large fleet customers, such as rental car companies. `` You give your fleet prices -LRB- early -RRB- so dealers can lock in prices early,'' he said. Final prices may fluctuate depending on a number of things, including competitors' prices and, to a smaller extent, sales figures and inventories, <PERSON> Cervone </PERSON> said. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced 8 percent to 12 percent retail price increases but wound up with final increases less than that. The prices for some of the company's slowest selling 1988-model cars fell, compared with 1987 models. At <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today, spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> said there was no firm schedule for notifying dealers of tentative fleet prices for the coming model year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON> said today he had no immediate comment on fleet or retail prices.

 A charity founded to grant dying children their last wishes has agreed to pay the state $ 50,000 and go out of business to settle accusations that it misused funds, the state attorney general announced today. The husband and wife who founded the Genie Project were accused of receiving excessive salaries, giving themselves loans, leasing a Cadillac, paying the rent on their home and even renting an X-rated movie with the charity's money. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> admitted no wrongdoing and agreed never to hold any office or directorship in a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> charity, according to state Attorney General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>. The agreement was entered in the form of a judgment in <ORGANIZATION> Waterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on July 7 and final notice was received last week at the attorney general's office, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said. A lawsuit filed on Sept. 12, 1985 accused the couple of violating state charity laws. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> has paid $ 18,259 to the state <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Another $ 5,298 has been seized from various banks, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>'s office said. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> will pay $ 24,259 to the state over 122 months, and $ 5,000 worth of computer equipment will be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>'s office said. The <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> also were put on probation for two years in a criminal case brought by the attorney general.

<HEAD>Chicago's Smoking Ban Goes Into Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite a new anti-smoking law, smokers were lighting up today in taxicabs, airport terminals, bus stations and other forbidden places. `` There has n't been any difference today,'' said <PERSON> Loice </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a ticket agent with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are n't paying any attention to the ban. Smoking also is banned in subway stations. The law, which took effect Sunday, forbids smoking in enclosed public places and requires employers to designate no-smoking areas if requested by workers. `` We're complying with the ordinance,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON>, spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> corporate headquarters in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said today. She said she knew of no complaints about the new law from the 8,000 headquarters employees. Similar laws have taken effect in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other cities around the country. However, if non-smokers here were annoyed by smokers' behavior, the police had n't heard about it. `` We've had no complaints at all,'' officer <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said Sunday night at police headquarters. Police Supt. <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has pointed out that the ordinance creating the ban, while it established fines of $ 25 to $ 100, did not give officers the power of arrest. He's suggested that non-smokers give dirty looks to people smoking where they should n't. But some non-smokers do n't seem to care. `` I do n't think it should be that big an issue,'' said non-smoker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. `` Smoking has been a way of life in this country for years. To take that away now is unfair.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemien </PERSON>, who quit smoking two years ago, said he does n't like the ban either `` What else are they going to take away?'' he said. `` They'll be coming into our bedrooms pretty soon and telling us what to do there.'' Although smoking in taxicabs also is outlawed, taxi driver <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a three-pack-a-day smoker, said: `` I'll smoke in my own cab no matter what the law says. I will never tell a passenger not to smoke.'' Taxi driver <PERSON> Suheil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajaj </PERSON>, who said he does n't smoke himself, said he believes taxi riders have a right to light up. `` I believe the customer is paying for the right to smoke,'' he said.

 Rescue workers have recovered 72 bodies from a passenger boat that sank last week in the fast-flowing waters of a <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tributary, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said rescue work continued for about 30 other people still missing and presumed to have gone down with the vessel when it struck a rock Thursday in the <LOCATION> Min </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province The news agency said 152 people had been rescued. There have been differing estimates of the number of dead and missing because of the remoteness of the area and confusion about how many people were on the boat. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said rescue efforts were being hampered by rapid currents in the river, which was swollen from torrential rains. The Chuanyun No. 24 had been traveling in a remote mountain area between the towns of <LOCATION> Yibin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Leshan </PERSON>, stopping along the river to pick up and unload passengers. The boat was owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Chongqing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, another official news agency, said today the sunken boat, which had been carried downstream by the undercurrent, had been located by Sunday and divers had reached the location.

fire, nearness to Old Faithful, hosing down buildings.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 A forest fire in Yellowstone National Park that doubled in size to more than 2,500 acres was within nine miles of Old Faithful geyser today, while a 23,100-acre blaze in the nearby <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION> appeared to be slowing down. Roughly 40,000 acres of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> have been burned by several fires, including 31,500 acres charred by the Clover Mist fire in the eastern half of the 2.2 million-acre park, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. `` These are conditions that we have n't seen in the recorded history of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. The park's south entrance, a hotel and two campgrounds were closed because of other fires and crews were hosing down some roofs to protect them from sparks. Hot, dry weather also helped fan flames over thousands of acres of trees and brush in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Two fires that burned together over some 10,800 acres in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Gold Rush country were contained Saturday and 90 percent controlled Sunday night, officials said. Damage in the twin fires was estimated at $ 11 million. A fire is considered contained when a fire break is built around it, and controlled when it is reduced to smoldering patches. Fire strategists met in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> at Old Faithful today to map out battle plans against fires in and around the nation's oldest park. `` They have so many fires going on right now in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, they have to make some decisions on where to put their resources,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lew </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the southern end of the 23,100-acre Mink Creek fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>'s Teton Wilderness was about 90 percent contained, but officials worried today that a wind shift could push the flames into dense stands of timber, said fire information officer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldapfel </PERSON>. The northern end of that fire, which was started by lightning in late June, had crossed <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s boundary into a backcountry region and firefighters were trying to keep it from advancing. The south entrance to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> hotel and two campgrounds, were closed because of other fires. Two fires along the shores of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and Shoshone lakes were less than one mile from <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> today, prompting crews to remove downed trees from around the campgrounds and hotel and to hose down the buildings to keep drifting embers from setting them ablaze, said <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. Along the west side of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the 2,500-acre North Fork fed on insect-killed trees in prime grizzly bear habitat on an isolated plateau and was within nine miles of Old Faithful, leading officials to consider additional closures. `` It's burning in that bug-kill lodgepole -LRB- pine trees -RRB- that's just dead wood and real dry,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON>, a helicopter pilot working on the fire `` It's really cookin'.'' The fire, believed to be man-caused, started Friday just across the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> border in the <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Wind blew it quickly into <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, ranger for the Targhee forest's Island Park District, said all but about 20 acres of the fire were inside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> portion of the blaze was contained by late Sunday. In the eastern part of the park, crews were working along the eastern edge of the Clover Mist fire to keep it out of adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. Extra crews and more equipment have been called in to battle a 500-acre fire raging out of control near Flaming Gorge Dam on the <LOCATION> Utah-Colorado </LOCATION> border, and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said 3,000-4 ,000 more acres was expected to burn today in the remote, tinder-dry forest Officials said they expected to contain a stubborn, 2,100-acre high-desert fire in south-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s Sawtooth National Forest today. More than 400 firefighters, supported by helicopters and aerial tankers filled with fire retardant, battled the 4-day-old blaze. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 160 firefighters worked to contain a 250-acre blaze in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. The fire threatened to spread into an area filled with dead and dying trees, said <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Riede </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>. Despite temperatures that reached 94 degrees on the fire lines, about 210 firefighters Sunday afternoon brought a 2,420-acre blaze on the <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> under control, said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wenatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> official.

 An explosion at a chemical plant early today rocked this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, injuring four employees and forcing at least 300 people from their homes for almost two hours, officials said. Police evacuated the residents living near <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical division polymer manufacturing plant as a precaution when irritating fumes drifted through the area following the 1 a.m. explosion, said dispatcher <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> About 300 people, many in pajamas and carrying children, crowded into the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oremus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robish </PERSON>, who helps out at the center. `` We heard the explosion and jumped out of bed like a spring,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Robish </PERSON>, 50, who lives two blocks from the plant. The residents were allowed back in their homes nearly two hours later, after the fumes cleared the area, <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> said. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> were at the scene, about 13 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, trying to determine the origin and cause of the blaze, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Corkery </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The plant, formerly known as the Union Chemical plant, makes latex, an adhesive used to bind materials in paint. The blast apparently occurred in `` an explosion-proof area'' equipped with special electrical wiring and reinforced walls, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, manager of field services at <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical division in suburban <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said damage to the plant was `` extensive.'' Nursing supervisor <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said three victims were brought to the emergency room, one of whom was badly burned and transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. A fourth victim, also badly burned, was taken directly to <LOCATION> Loyola </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Robish </PERSON> said volunteers at the community center served coffee to the evacuees. `` A lot of people are in their night gowns, with their pillows and puppies and children,'' she said. Among the evacuees was <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyrda </PERSON>, 22. `` I just got done reading and was getting ready for bed when I heard this very loud boom,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dyrda </PERSON> said she grabbed her 3-year-old son and headed for the center.

<TEXT>
 Former college football star <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> will not be retried in a 31-year-old slaying because there is no new evidence in the case, a prosecutor said today. `` We have gone to great extremes to try to find new proof in this case ... There is no new proof. There is nothing different than what we had initially,'' said District Attorney General <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerbitz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON>, 53, went on trial last month for the July 20, 1957, shotgun death of moonshine runner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, but a mistrial was declared when the jury deadlocked 10-2 for acquittal. The state contended that <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON>, then a 22-year-old college student, killed <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> because <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 24, had beaten <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Voiles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s ex-girlfriend and <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON>'s sister. <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> claimed self-defense, testifying that he fired a shotgun at <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> only after the bootlegger drove up beside his car on a dark street and pointed a pistol at him. The prosecutor said the state was handicapped because it could try <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> only for first-degree murder, since the statute of limitations for lesser degrees of homicide has expired. `` If this case would have gone to the jury under a first-degree, second-degree, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter option, the outcome may very well have been different in June,'' he said. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Gerbitz </PERSON> said, the state was pleased that it had finally answered the question of who had killed <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. `` For 31 years, the <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> family lived with the fact that they did n't know who killed their son and their brother,'' he said. `` They know now who killed him. And even though his admission is one of self-defense, it was an admission.'' At the time of the slaying, <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> was preparing for his senior year at <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, where he was a halfback on the football team. That fall, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> went 10-0 and won their only national championship. Although <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> was questioned about the slaying in 1957, no charges were filed until March 2, 1988, when he was indicted after a 14-month investigation that began when <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s mother, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, asked police to reopen the case.

<HEAD>Pinochet Expected To Be Single Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s four top military commanders will meet Aug. 30 to pick the candidate for the presidential referendum later this year, the government announced today. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, the right-wing military commander who has ruled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since coming to power in a 1973 coup, is widely expected to be the lone candidate. It will be the first presidential voting in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since 1970, when <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist, was elected. He died in the coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The presidential nomination is to be made by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, and by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Toribio </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, and national police chief <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON>. The nomination, based on a 1980 military-drafted Constitution, must be unanimous and made within 48 hours. If the four commanders disagree, the candidate is to be chosen by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, made up of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the four-member military junta and the presidents of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. The latter is a Pinochet-appointed official. The Constitution mandates that the vote be held within 30 to 60 days after the nomination of the candidate. <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> said last week that the date for the vote has been set, but he would not disclose it. The vote is widely expected to be held in the first week of October, according to unofficial reports. In the voting, Chileans will only be able to vot `` yes'' or `` no'' on the candidate. If he wins approval, the candidate will serve an eight-year term starting March 11, 1989. If he is rejected by voters, a multi-candidate election will be held in 1990, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then.

<TEXT>
 Weeks of dry, hot weather are forcing the state's four trout farms into a race with drought as workers rush to transfer fish from too-warm hatching troughs to cooler streams before they die. `` The warmer the water the less oxygen the water has, and we have trouble keeping them alive,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ort </PERSON>, a worker at the state's <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> Fish Hatchery in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>. `` We'd rather give the fishermen their fish a month early rather than keep them.'' Because of the summer drought, the state <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> must finish stocking 600,000 fish in streams, lakes and rivers by the end of July, a month earlier than usual, officials say. Already, the water in <LOCATION> Armstrong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which feeds into fish-hatching troughs at the <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> hatchery, has topped 70 degrees three times this month, <PERSON> Ort </PERSON> said. Water levels in the creek have dropped as well, forcing <PERSON> Ort </PERSON> to allow seven of his 20 ponds to dry up. Most of western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 2,000 miles of trout streams, lakes and rivers must be stocked by the commission to maintain the popular sport of trout-fishing. The state's trout-stocking program breeds the fish and raises them from eggs to a catchable size _ 8 inches or longer when the fish are about 18 months old, officials say. Once in the state's rivers and streams, most trout are caught within a week or two, said <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a production coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>. `` I would expect the catch to be higher than usual because the water levels have been so low the fish do n't have a place to escape to,'' Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 - <LOCATION> CHANDIGARH </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists today shot and killed the head priest of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine in the city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, police said. The militants also killed a secretary of the temple committee, according to police. The victims were identified as head priest <PERSON> Sohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiromani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurdwara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prabandhak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which manages Sikh temples. The head of the committee, <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghuman </PERSON>, suffered at least four bullet wounds and was reported in critical condition in a hospital, police said. According to police, Sikh extremists opened fire on the three men at noon on a street in <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, about 55 miles west of the state capital of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. The assailants sprayed them with bullets from a AK-47 Chinese rifle as the three emerged from a board meeting of an engineering college, Indian news agencies said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. The temple committee appointed <PERSON> Sohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> head priest in May, after police and paramilitary troops forced more than 150 Sikh extremists out of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, which they used as a base to wage their guerrilla war for an independent homeland in the northwestern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The head priest's predecessor and four other <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> high priests, who were jailed during the operation, remain in police custody. The appointment of <PERSON> Sohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a moderate, was opposed by the militants, who also objected to the priest's efforts to exonerate former <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Chief Minister <PERSON> Surjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnala </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barnala </PERSON> had been excommunicated from the Sikh faith by radical priests in charge of the temple. Police today reported four other deaths in extremist violence in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 Arab assailants today stoned an Israeli army jeep in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, forcing the jeep to veer off the road and turn over, the army said. Four military police were injured. The incident occurred several hours after the army freed 148 Palestinian prisoners from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> as a goodwill gesture to Moslems on the four-day Eid al-Adha holiday, or `` Feast of the Sacrifice.'' An army spokesman said the jeep carrying green-uniformed border patrol guards was stoned as it patrolled the Jabaliya refugee camp. The driver was injured in the hand and veered off the road, said the spokesman, who could not be identified in accordance with army regulations. Three other police suffered minor injuries and two of them were taken to a hospital, he said. Arab news reports said soldiers immediately clamped a curfew on the camp, banning more than 60,000 residents from leaving their homes. The army today freed 148 Palestinians from the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> tent prison in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert, a spokesman said. He said some had been jailed without trial and the rest were serving short sentences for crimes linked to the Palestinian uprising. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said more than 3,000 Palestinian detainees would remain in <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION>. The army said it held more than 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> and other prisons. The prisoners' release came a day after confrontations in the occupied territories left two Palestinians dead and six wounded, raising to 233 the Arab death toll since the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have also died. Seven cities and refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> remained under curfew today after the clashes, the army said. The unrest was partly triggered by coinciding Jewish and Moslem holidays. The Moslem feast marks when the biblical patriarch <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> was ordered by <PERSON> God </PERSON> to sacrifice his son, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>. The Jewish commemoration marks the destruction of a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> temple by Roman rulers nearly 2,000 years ago. A holiday custom calls for the Moslems to visit cemeteries and leaders of the uprising called on their followers to visit the graves of Arabs slain during the uprising. In an unprecedented ruling Sunday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld an army decision to temporarily occupy a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> home so soldiers could oversee a highway that has been the scene of numerous stoning attacks on Israeli vehicles. Court spokesman <PERSON> Shmaryahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the ruling appeared to be the first time the court had allowed soldiers to take over an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> house for security purposes. In the past, the army has confiscated, wrecked or sealed homes belonging to Palestinians suspected of involvement in anti-Israeli violence. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said soldiers have wrecked or sealed up 52 Palestinian homes since December. The ruling was one of a series of decisions since the uprising began in which the court has consistently upheld measures of the Israeli military authorities.

 The historic <PERSON> Snee </PERSON> Farm home of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinckney </PERSON>, a signer of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution who served as governor, senator and congressman, has been bought by a preservation group. The two-story frame farm house and the surrounding 25 acres in suburban <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> had been slated for part of a residential development, but a citizens group known as Friends of Historic Snee Farm took title to the property over the weekend. The group bought the property for $ 2 million, but must still raise $ 1 million to pay off a bank loan, said <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON>, one of the organizers of the preservation effort. The group plans to pay off the remaining debt and turn the site over to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. About 50 people, including state and federal officials, gathered under rainy skies outside the 18th century structure Saturday for the announcement. `` This is a wonderful time for the state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> because you're preserving a piece of our state that can not be duplicated and can not be replicated,'' Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. The farm house dates to 1754. <PERSON> Pinckey </PERSON> not only was a signer of the Constitution, but also served as a state lawmaker, governor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, congressman and American minister to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pinckney </PERSON> claimed to be 26 at the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which would have made him the youngest signer. However, he was really 29 at the time, and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, at 27, was actually the youngest signer. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> told the group `` you're preserving here some of the most important history of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' He called <PERSON> Pinckney </PERSON> the `` second most important man'' at the constitutional convention after <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> family, which owned the property, also gave a gift of $ 100,000 for the effort. `` Of course it's a beautiful piece of property and as you know I would have liked to have developed it. But since they made such a dedicated effort, we think we did the right thing,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, one of the owners. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said the park service has agreed to restore the vacant house and operate it as an educational resource. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the assistant director of cultural affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said it will cost about $ 500,000 a year to operate the <PERSON> Pinckney </PERSON> home.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> swimming instructor today pleaded innocent to all charges against him in the death of a recruit during a training exercise. Petty Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery in the death of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, described as being literally scared to death. An Aug. 29 trial date was set for his court-martial. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has accused <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water after other instructors had physically forced the recruit back into a swimming pool at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was pushed back in after he panicked, climbed out and shouted that he was quitting the course. Also facing court-martial is Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, officer in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the time of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, who was on the telephone in his office overlooking the pool, is charged with dereliction of duty and scheduled for trial Aug. 22. Four petty officers, all instructors, were charged with conspiracy to commit battery and have been given non-judicial punishments including reductions in rank and loss of pay. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>'s plea was accepted and the trial date set by Cmdr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Radlinski </PERSON>, a military judge. Defense lawyers had asked to delay the trial until late September due to the illness of the wife of <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>'s military counsel, Marine Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>. The judge said he may reconsider the request for a delay if Mrs. <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>'s condition does n't improve within a week. Two civilian lawyers, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiltshire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, joined <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>'s defense team last week. After <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was pushed back into the pool, <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> allegedly grasped him in a head-hold and dragged him into deep water. The head-hold was part of a training exercise known as `` sharks and daisies'' in which instructors, playing the role of panicked air crash victims, would grab trainees who were supposed to pull them under water to break loose and then make a rescue. At the investigative hearing, a pathologist testified <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia about being dragged under water, which triggered heart failure followed by drowning.

<HEAD>China Boosts Cigarette, Liquor Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Monday announced sharp price increases for cigarettes and liquor, but also said inflation-battered consumers will be spared further increases this year. Yuan Mu, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or cabinet, said the prices of famous brand cigarettes and spirits will be allowed to float as of Tuesday, putting an end to government-fixed, and generally arbitrarily low, prices. Yuan said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had decided not to carry out any other price reforms this year to curb inflation, which has been rising at an alarming rate since the beginning of 1988, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said last week that consumer prices in June were 19 percent higher than in the same month in 1987, compared to an inflation rate of 7.2 percent for all of last year. The government earlier this year raised the prices of eggs, vegetables, pork and sugar as part of reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and allowing the value of goods to be determined by market forces. The elimination of government controls has caused the prices of some goods to soar as the inefficient economy fails to keep up with rising demand. Black market dealings and hoarding of goods still sold at government-set prices have also boosted prices. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Changbi </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prices </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the prices of famous brand cigarettes could go up between 15 and 290 percent after they are allowed to fluctuate. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the price for a bottle of `` <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous and sought-after spirit, will jump from $ 5.40 to $ 32.40. Yuan said the price increases for choice cigarettes and wines will have little social impact `` because most buyers are government organizations and those individuals with high incomes.'' But <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the price of B-grade cigarettes will also be boosted by 13.4 percent and all alcohol made from grain will go up in price by 20 percent. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> uses 14 million tons of grain a year to make beer and other alcohol, and the government has said this is a luxury the nation ca n't afford when it is struggling to produce enough grain just to keep its 1 billion people fed. Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and other reform-minded leaders in recent months have emphasized that price reform is risky but inevitable if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is to modernize its economy and end the heavy financial burden of price subsidizing. The government has put off decontrolling prices, partly because of mounting public discontent over the rising cost of living. The Politburo, the party's supreme decision-making body, announced in June that systematic plans for price reform were being drawn up. Senior officials said the program would take three to five years to carry out. Yuan said price adjustments will resume Jan. 1, 1989, when newspapers, which have been hit by jumps in the price of newsprint, will cost more. He did not say what the increase would be. Yuan said the rise in the cost of cigarettes should curb speculation and profiteering that has thrived under the current pricing system. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the world's biggest cigarette producer and consumer, turning out 228 billion cigarettes a year for its 300 million smokers.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special ruling party congress today accepted the resignation of strongman Ne Win but rejected his call for a referendum that could have ended 26 years of one-party rule, a congress delegate said. Official <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, however, said only that Ne Win's resignation had been debated by the delegates and did not indicate what action, if any, was reached The delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to accept the resignations of Ne Win as party chief and <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> as the vice chairman, but to retain them as `` inactive members.'' Burmese analysts suggested that the vagueness of the official radio broadcast reflected divisions within party ranks. The broadcast said the 1,061 party delegates empowered the party's central committee to evaluate a sweeping proposal for economic reform. But it gave no indication of whether any of the new measures had been accepted. The three-day congress of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been considering dramatic changes in a state-controlled economic system that turned a potentially prosperous country into a debt-ridden, poverty-stricken nation. The key architect of the system, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, tendered his resignation Saturday as chairman of the party and offered to remove himself from political life. Five other top leaders likewise submitted resignations. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday that an emergency session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would convene Wednesday, apparently to act on Ne Win's proposal of holding a referendum on whether <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> should scrap a quarter century of one-party rule in favor of a multi-party system The emergency session could also deal with the appointment of new government leaders to replace the five who are resigning. The five, including President <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yu </LOCATION>, held government posts in addition to their party positions. Prime Minister <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON>, one of the few top leaders not on the resignation roll, was expected to be named today to replace the 77-year-old Ne Win as chairman of the ruling party. The sudden and generally unexpected changes come in wake of bloody anti-government riots and worsening economic conditions in the isolationist Southeast Asian nation. The official radio, broadcasting from the congress, carried speeches of several among the more than 1,000 delegates asking Ne Win to reconsider his retirement `` until success has been achieved.'' Indeed, some Western diplomats doubt that Ne Win _ who has held undisputed power for 26 years _ will desist from interference in the future party and the organization of the new government. Not only did the former military chief, who seized power in a 1962 coup, crush anti-government opposition that occasionally flared. He also moved against leaders within his own ranks when they exhibited too much promise and independence. This has left a leadership vacuum in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that may prove difficult to fill if there is a wholesale removal of officials from party and government ranks, as Ne Win indicated. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON>, who assumed the prime ministership in 1977, has to date not exhibited any particular dynamism or vision that would be necessary to implement the wide-ranging reforms being debated by the congress. In a speech on Sunday, party general secretary <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> admitted that economic production had declined, working skills have deteriorated and `` losses and wastages can not be controlled effectively.'' `` Because of these weaknesses and as a result of adverse repercussions from the world economic conditions today, the state economic situation is declining,'' he said. <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> called for cutting most state involvement in agriculture, mining, fisheries, industry, transportation and other economic sectors.

 Americans believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has lost its edge in space exploration and favor initiatives including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station and manned flights to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. A sizable share of the respondents in the national poll said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing too little in space exploration. As well as backing new efforts, a majority expressed support for the space shuttle program. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to resume shuttle launches in September, more than 2 -LCB- years after the shuttle Challenger exploded during takeoff, killing the seven astronauts aboard. However, equipment problems may delay the launch. Nearly half of the 1,223 adults surveyed said the shuttle explosion had shaken their confidence in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, and 60 percent of that group said their faith in the space agency has not been restored. That means that about 30 percent of all respondents lacked confidence in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. Still, when asked to rate its overall effectiveness, 58 percent said it has done a good or excellent job while 37 percent said only fair or poor. About half the respondents said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget should remain the same, and 30 percent said it should be increased. Despite concerns over the federal deficit, only 18 percent said the space budget should be decreased. And of those who wanted <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget increased, 74 percent said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to accomplish it. In another indication of general support for space projects, 40 percent said the nation was doing too little in exploring space and 36 percent said it was doing about enough. Just about a fifth said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing too much in space exploration. There was a striking split between the sexes, with men far more likely than women to favor space programs. Fifty-six percent of men said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing too little in space exploration; only a quarter of women agreed. Forty-one percent of men supported increasing the space exploration budget, compared to just 19 percent of women. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 30 years ago to pursue civilian exploration of space, but in recent years it increasingly has handled military payloads as well. That was opposed by a slim plurality in the survey: Forty-eight percent said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> should be involved in non-military projects only, while 41 percent approved including military work. The split was narrowly outside the poll's margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. Fewer than a quarter of respondents said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ahead of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in space exploration, while the remainder were split on whether the Soviets are ahead or the two countries are about even. At the same time, there was sentiment for superpower cooperation in space. About half of those polled favored last month's proposal by the Soviets for a U.S.-Soviet joint effort to send astronauts to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. An additional 15 percent said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should work alone to reach Mars. Taken together, 64 percent favored some program to land astronauts on Mars, while 30 percent were opposed. The rest had no opinion. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has no program to send astronauts to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. It is seeking funding for a space station, but the $ 200 million approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this month is only enough to phase out the program or put it on hold. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had approved $ 700 million and a joint committee is to resolve the issue. The goal of a space station was supported by 55 percent, with 34 percent opposed. On the soon-to-be resumed space shuttle program, 40 percent said efforts should be expanded and the same number said work should continue at the same level. Fewer than a fifth said the shuttle program should be cut back. The Media General-AP poll consisted of telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with a randomly selected sample of 1,223 adults across the nation. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> -RRB-.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with 1,223 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult in each household who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five points, for example, for those who want the budget for space exploration to be increased. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed 100: 1. In general, do you think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is doing too much in space exploration right now, or too little, or about enough? Too much: 19 percent. Too little: 40 percent. About enough: 36 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 5 percent. 2. Do you think the space shuttle program should be expanded, cut back, or kept at the same level?

The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has suggested a joint program with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to land astronauts on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Do you think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should try to land astronauts on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> by itself, or should it undertake a joint program with the Soviets, or should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not try to land astronauts on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> at all? By itself: 15 percent. Joint program: 49 percent. Not at all: 30 percent. DK-NA: 7 percent. 5. Do you think the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's budget for the overall space program should be increased, decreased, or kept at the same level? Increased: 30 percent. Decreased: 18 percent. Same level: 48 percent. DK-NA: 5 percent. a. If increased: Would you be willing to pay higher taxes for the increase? Yes: 74 percent. No: 20 percent. DK-NA: 6 percent. 6. Who do you think is ahead in the exploration of space _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, or do you think they are about equal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>: 23 percent. Soviets: 31 percent. Even: 37 percent. DK-NA: 20 percent. 7. How would you rate the overall effectiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> _ excellent, good, only fair or poor?

Only non-military: 48 percent. DK-NA: 11 percent. 9. The space shuttle program was set back when the shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, killing the seven astronauts aboard. Looking back, did that accident shake your confidence in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, or not? Yes: 47 percent. No: 50 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent. 11. If yes: How about now _ has your confidence in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> been restored, or not? Yes: 34 percent. No: 60 percent. DK-NA: 6 percent.

 Attorneys for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> have asked for a delay in Tuesday's scheduled vote by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on an impeachment recommendation, contending the panel is rushing to a decision on a precedent-setting issue. `` We ca n't see any need for what seems to us an unseemly haste,'' said <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' attorneys, on Monday. A committee staff member said the request for a delay had been received, but that no decision had been made and the vote was still scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black appointed to the federal bench in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, was acquitted in 1983 of bribery charges. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee has recommended that he be impeached on 17 counts of official misconduct, including some relating to the bribery case. The full committee was scheduled to act on the recommendation Tuesday. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> contrasted the handling of his client's case with that of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. In <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s case, the subcommittee heard direct evidence from three key witnesses at his trial, which ended in a conviction for lying to a grand jury The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> brought impeachment charges against <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, which still are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 The government announced plans Monday to equip the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> navy with a fleet of 12 mine sweepers at a cost of $ 623 million. `` These vessels will play a crucial role in our coastal security and sovereignty,'' said Defense Minister <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>. `` Without mine sweepers, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s ports could be shut down by hostile mining activity.'' The vessels will be designed and built in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and equipped with 40mm Bofors guns and remote-control mine-hunting systems. They will be manned by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 3,000-member naval reserve as part of a buildup outlined in a 1987 government report on defense policy. Naval reservists are patrolling in trawlers and other small ships because there are no mine sweepers in the fleet.

<HEAD>China Issues Regulations to Protect Women Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Monday issued regulations forbidding job discrimination against women and guaranteeing them healthy work environments. The State Council, or Cabinet, also said employers can not reduce the wages or annul women's contracts during periods of pregnancy, maternity leave or nursing. The regulations, to go into effect Sept. 1, extended maternity leave from 56 to 90 days, and stipulate that women who have difficult deliveries will have an option of another 15 days. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s constitution guarantees equality between the sexes, but in reality <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women face various kinds of educational and job discrimination. Women university graduates have much more difficulty finding suitable jobs than men, women's wages are often lower, and factory managers with newly won powers to dismiss workers have fired women in larger numbers than men. In the countryside, many girls are forced by custom and parents to quit school even before completing the compulsory nine years so they can work in the fields or in factories. Women frequently also work in small and often unsafe mines, although past laws, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> regulations, state that women are not allowed to engage in underground mining or heavy labor unsuited to the individual's health. The regulations urge employers with a large staff of women to provide appropriate sanitary equipment, rooms for pregnant women to rest, and nurseries and kindergartens. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said, without providing details, that violators of the regulations or those who infringe on the rights of women workers will be punished.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you thought the'60s were swinging, just look at the'80s. According to a statistical study published Monday, the sexual permissiveness associated with the 1960s is tame stuff compared with the 1980s _ AIDS and yuppie puritanism notwithstanding The `` Swinging'60s'' were invented largely by British pop musicians, fashion designers and hairstylists, so it was appropriate that the study came from a British independent research office, the Family Policy Studies Center. It reported that the divorce rate has jumped from 2.1 per 1,000 marriages in 1961 to 12.9 in 1986; illegitimate births are up from 6 percent to 21 percent; births are down from 17.9 per 1,000 to 13.3; and teen-age brides are down from 28 percent to 14 percent. It says that between 1960 and 1964, only one in 100 first-time brides under age 25 lived with their partners before marrying them. Twenty years later, the figure is almost one in four, the study says. Figures for bridegrooms do not appear in the government statistics used in the study, according to its editor, <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Henwood </PERSON>. The report says the figures suggest a much more liberal attitude in the 1980s toward childbirth out of wedlock. Not only has illegitimacy more than trebled, but the mothers apparently feel much less compulsion to marry before giving birth, while the fathers are more likely to acknowledge paternity. The study said 38 percent of birth certificates for illegitimate children bore the names of both parents in 1961. In 1986, the figure had risen to 66 percent, it said. `` The paradox of the 1960s may be less of a puzzle than it first appears,'' the report concludes. `` It is, after all, the people who grew up in, or were living through, the 1960s who are now making their appearance in many of the cohabitation, illegitimacy, marriage and divorce statistics. The class of'68 has come of age.'' `` The swinging'60s do seem a bit of mythical when we look at the facts and figures, but it really depends on the image of'60s,'' Ms. <PERSON> Henwood </PERSON> said in an interview. At 30, she admits to having no firsthand experience of the `` Swinging'60s,'' but knows they were `` a period of great change _ music, clothing and politics ... We look back and assume it was a time of free love, communes, that sort of thing. In fact, what made the image was a few notorious figures living in permissive relationships, but their values were not shared by most people at the time.'' The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> asked some leading figures of the'60s what they thought of the study. `` The ` Swinging'60s' took their name from the music, not the morality,'' said actor <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamp </PERSON>, who made his name playing the title role in the 1962 film version of `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>.'' `` Compare <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> and the Pet Shop Boys to the Beatles. There you have the essential difference between the'60s and the'80s,'' Stamp was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrimpton </PERSON>, the model who made the miniskirt famous, was quoted as saying: `` I never had a swinging mentality. I wore short skirts but I was a commodity of the'60s. It was other people who were making things happen. I just happened to be there.'' And cartoonist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Steadman </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` The permissive society was about lots of things, not just sex. We were willing to buck authority ... Now life is getting more and more standardized and barren, and there is a backlash spurred by AIDS, a reformist influence which does rather tend to concentrate the mind.''

<TEXT>
 The member parties of the governing coalition, in control of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after general elections, began talks Monday that are expected to result in <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON> continuing as prime minister. Such negotiations have taken weeks after past elections, but <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nation </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, whose party got the most votes, said after Sunday's ballot he felt a prime minister could be agreed upon this week. His party and its three partners in the last coalition won 58 percent of the 357 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s lower house. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, a 67-year-old former general, has no party affilitation. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, who was a deputy premier in the last government, already has expressed support for keeping <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> in office. The prime minister has made no public statements about the matter. Political analysts predict difficulties ahead for an administration led by the former general. `` The new government will face the same difficult problems it endured under <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s last administration because there is growing and open resentment of and opposition to Prem,'' said <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON> <PERSON> Suksamran </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Chulalongkorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Friction among coalition partners caused trouble in <LOCATION> Prem </LOCATION>'s last government. <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON> and other political observers say Prem might not be able to complete a four-year term. He called Sunday's election two years early. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> has been prime minister since 1980, dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> twice for elections, survived two coup attempts and formed five cabinets. He is the longest-serving premier in modern Thai history. Among his serious problems are flagging support in the powerful military, sharp criticisms from opposition parties and protests by students and labor. `` These pressures will only get more intense,'' <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Party leader <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> told newsmen Monday a `` gentlemen's agreement'' had been reached by the four coalition partners to back Prem The person chosen also must be approved by King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s constitutional monarch. Thai Nation, <ORGANIZATION> Chatichai </ORGANIZATION>'s well-financed party, won 87 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s 17th general election and its coalition partners got a total of 123: <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 54; the <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 48 and <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 21. Interior Minister <PERSON> Prachuab </PERSON> <PERSON> Soontrangkul </PERSON> said 16.9 million of the 26.6 million eligible voters participated. Sixteen parties entered 3,606 candidates and only one party failed to win representation in Parliament. The main opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won 31 seats. The Thai Unity party gained 35 seats and was considered a possible coalition member, but party leader <PERSON> Narong </PERSON> <PERSON> Wongwan </PERSON> told Thai journalists he would not join a `` Prem coalition.'' Thai elections center largely on personalities, not political platforms, and the main question in this election was whether <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> should continue in office. Despite the factionalism in his government, <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> has had the support of three of the nation's most powerful institutions: the military, bureaucracy and monarchy.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Relative To Stand Trial in September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The son-in-law of the late Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> will stand trial in September on charges of giving and accepting bribes, it was reported Monday. The government daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the Military Collegium of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday determined there is sufficient evidence to put <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> on trial with eight other people. It said the trial would begin in early September but did not give an exact date. The evidence against the nine defendants is contained in 110 volumes, the newspaper reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency had said in January that a bribery and corruption investigation of <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who is in his 50s, had been completed. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> married <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> while her father was party leader and was appointed in 1980 as deputy interior minister, a post that is in the department overseeing uniformed police and issuance of travel and emigration visas. He was removed from the post three years ago for what was said at the time to be preparation for transfer to other, unspecified work. But he was arrested last year and accused of corruption and bribe-taking. The Soviet press has carried detailed reports in recent months about the investigation at a time when <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who served from 1964 until his death in 1982, has come under increasing criticism for leading the country during a `` period of stagnation'' when the economy sagged and cronyism and corruption prevailed. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency has reported that <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> is accused of accepting bribes totaling more than $ 1.1 million, equivalent to 270 years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker. The labor newspaper Trud reported June 18 that <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> is accused of providing well-paid protection to police in the Soviet Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> who had killed, raped, extorted and robbed at will. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reported Thursday that <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and other relatives of the late Kremlin chief have been stripped of unmerited privileges and will receive only the retirement benefits they earned.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese officials opened talks Monday on accounting for 1,761 American servicemen still missing from the Vietnam War, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official said Monday. The official, who asked not to be identified, said he had no details on the talks, being held in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and expected to last four days. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on July 13 returned 25 remains it identified as those of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen killed in the war. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> also handed over a list of names and `` associations'' relating to the remains. Some of the names appear on the official list of 1,761 Americans who remain missing in action from the war. The turnover was the fifth since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, acting as a special presidential envoy, reached an agreement in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> a year ago under which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would accelerate the search for remains, especially several dozen on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s top priority list. This week's talks were agreed upon during a meeting at the Untied Nations on June 8 between <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> and Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technical team was led by Lt.

Since the war ended, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned more than 150 sets of remains that the army laboratory has confirmed as Americans. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it has returned the remains of 241 missing Americans and information on 45 others whose remains were `` determined to be no longer in existence.''

<HEAD>TV Station Reports Hezbollah Plans To Kidnap Another German</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German television station reported Monday the radical Shiite Moslem group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, on orders from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, was preparing to kidnap another West German in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. SAT-1, a cable television station, said it obtained a copy of a telegram in Arabic from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> security officials in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the military attache at the Iranian Embassy in the Lebanese capital. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has never claimed it holds foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But Hezbollah in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is believed to be an umbrella for the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups who hold 18 foreign captives, including a West German. SAT-1 did not say how it obtained the document, but said it showed personnel at the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` were in the gravest danger.'' According to SAT-1, the telegram said: `` We want to inform you that we now have received sufficient addresses and information about the embassy of the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. We will tell you about the action plan as soon as possible, which we, with the help of our people in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, will carry out in accordance with your orders.'' SAT-1 said the telegram had been sent sometime in March, but did not give other details. It said that although the telegram was months old, unidentified experts considered the threat to be current. West German <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> has been held hostage since January 1987. Another West German taken captive that month was released earlier. A Lebanese man, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, has been convicted in the kidnappings. Officials say he hoped to win the release of his brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a hijacking suspect who is on trial in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A third <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother is security chief for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that while it's likely President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' latest attempt to require employers to give workers advance notice of layoffs or plant shutdowns, ` it's always open until it's done. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters the bill, which passed both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month by veto-proof margins, had arrived at the White House, and that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has until Aug. 3 to make a decision. The spokesman said the issue was likely to be raised at a meeting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will hold Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders, but he disputed suggestions that <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers will urge the president to sign the bill. `` I would say there are number of them who will recommend a veto,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Last week, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> that a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto was likely. Meanwhile, the administration's stand on the issue was repeatedly assailed by Democrats at their national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said `` our longstanding position has been that it is unacceptable to the president, that he has signaled veto, he has vetoed it once already as part of another bill and I would suspect that position will be maintained.'' But during the daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing Monday, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> left the door slightly ajar. `` <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said it was likely or most likely that he would veto it,'' the spokesman said. `` I have said that from this podium. That certainly is the case, but it's always open until it's done.'' `` There are some congressional leaders who would like to give us the benefits of their advice and this is an opportunity for them to do it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. A provision requiring private industry to give workers 60 days advance notice of plant closings was contained in legislation <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed earlier this year overhauling the nation's trade laws. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the bill, saying he did n't want the government legislating restrictions on the ability of company executives to make critical decisions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the matter of worker notification should be left to employers and employees to work out separately. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, certain to get the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next month, has stated sentiments similar to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s on the issue, although there have been reports the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign would prefer to see the president let the bill become law. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday he did n't know anything about whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was arguing a case for the signing of the plant-closing bill.

 The founders of a charity that grants dying children their last wishes have agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine and disband to settle accusations they misused donations for personal loans, excessive salaries and rental on an X-rated movie. Genie Project founders <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> also were accused of using the charity's money to lease a Cadillac and to pay rent on their home. State Attorney General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> announced a settlement Monday under which the <ORGANIZATION> Bateses </ORGANIZATION> admitted no wrongdoing and agreed never to hold any office or directorship in a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> charity. The agreement was in the form of a judgment in <ORGANIZATION> Waterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> entered July 7, and final notice was received last week at the attorney general's office, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said. A lawsuit filed Sept. 12, 1985, accused the couple of violating state charity laws. The charity raised $ 237,000 in 1984 and was accused of spending only $ 10,000 on dying children that year. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> has paid $ 18,259 to the state <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and $ 5,298 has been seized from various banks, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>'s office said. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> will pay $ 24,259 to the state over 122 months and $ 5,000 worth of computer equipment will be turned over to the department. The <ORGANIZATION> Bateses </ORGANIZATION> also were put on probation for two years in a criminal case. They had been charged with providing false information to the consumer department. The Bateses, who are divorced, could n't be reached for comment. There is no telephone listing for either, and their attorney was n't in his office Monday morning, his secretary said

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> may wither away as the biggest source of aid to the Third World unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts soon to pledge a new contribution, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, warned on Monday. The bank, headed by <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, a former congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, wants a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge of $ 70.1 million a year over the next six years for an increase in its capital. So far, 140 of the 151 governments that own the bank have decided to contribute. Among the other countries that have not made a pledge are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has urged approval of the contribution. It has been held up in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by disagreement over what should be done to handle the bulk of the Third World's $ 1.2 trillion debt. Last year the bank got back more in repayments and interest from Third World borrowers than it gave them in new loans. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials want to reverse that trend and increase lending to well over $ 20 billion a year in the early 1990s. `` Our influence and leadership within the bank are certainly at stake, and I would raise the question ... if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not going to participate in capital increases ... whether the bank itself can survive over a long period of time,'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> told a news conference. He added that the bank could continue lending for a year or two without new capital. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as the biggest shareholder, is expected to furnish more than 18 percent. `` But against the prospect of not getting their capital replenished, it is not in the nature of the beast and would not be responsible for them to continue lending at that rate of speed in the face of a vote of no-confidence by their major shareholders,'' said <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last year. A contribution has been endorsed by former presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Last week they were joined by nine former secretaries of the treasury. A group of supporters, the <ORGANIZATION> Bretton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking statements of backing from the major presidential candidates.

 Men dressed as policemen killed an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> man Monday while Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> delivered a sermon a mile away in which he implored Americans not to romanticize Irish violence. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, was shot in the head after answering a knock on his door, police said. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, 33, belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement issued in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> said he was one of its members. He was shot down 48 hours after an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb killed a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> couple and their 6-year-old son, who had just driven across the border from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> took responsibility but said the attack was on the wrong target. Press reports suggested the intended victim may have been a judge who drove past shortly afterward. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> learned of <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s death after leaving <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to deliver a sermon in <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. He said the killing, and Saturday's bombing, `` poignantly brought into focus the stupidity, the irrationality of the cycle of the violence. ... Where can this conceivably end? How this can conceivably please almighty God?'' Authorities said three men wearing police uniforms killed <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> and escaped in a red car. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said it did not believe policemen committed the crime, but that the assailants could have had help from sympathizers in the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ulster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Constabulary </LOCATION>, the mainly Protestant police force in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. When <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> was shot on Friendly Street, the cardinal was at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral in the heart of Roman Catholic <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, deploring `` some on our own shores, some in my own country, who romanticize violence when it is several thousand miles away, who do n't know what it does to a land, who do n't know the insecurity that it brings, who do n't know how it keeps a people oppressed.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who is leading 300 Americans on a pilgrimage to pray for peace in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, returned to that theme at <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, in the south of the province. Addressing an ecumenical congregation at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral, he again denounced Americans who `` continue to perpetuate the myth that this violence reflects the glory of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, that we can stand around pianos ad sing sentimental songs and believe that what occurs today is in the tradition of the martyrs and the saints. The bombing Saturday was the fifth admitted blunder by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> that has killed or wounded innocent civilians since November, when 11 <ORGANIZATION> Protestants </ORGANIZATION> at a war memorial ceremony were killed by a bomb intended for British soldiers. At least 2,660 people have been killed since political and sectarian warfare began in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in August 1969, including 44 so far this year. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> republic. `` The terrorism has got to be deplored on either side,'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who is on the pilgrimage, told reporters in <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. `` No one believes that, because the cardinal and 300 pilgrims came from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, that we were going to be stopping terrorism. In fact the acts of terrorism underscore the need for prayer.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> secretary, said: `` Every murder is an atrocity, and just this weekend we've had a particularly awful atrocity committed by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, and the trouble is, once one is committed, then somebody on the other extreme feels the need to strike back.'' He met with <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> separately and praised their `` intelligent and constructive interest,'' compared with what he called the `` nonsense talked in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and `` ignorance of the true situation in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> toured <PERSON> Divis </PERSON> <PERSON> Flats </PERSON>, the high-rise homes of some of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s most impoverished Catholics, on Sunday and urged American investors to bring business and jobs to the area. He said he looked across the geographical divisions of the city, which are based on religion, and `` I asked myself: Good Lord, where is the rationale in this? How can we purport to be made in the image and likeness of almighty God?''

 A man was executed Monday after being convicted of taking bribes from companies speculating in much-coveted color television sets, according to an official report. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yonghong </PERSON> was executed for receiving about $ 32,400 to help work units obtain color TVs. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON>, an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, in one instance was given the equivalent of $ 10,800 for selling 200 color TVs to a company. The demand for color TVs far exceeds supply, and profiteers able to obtain sets can sell them on the black market for far more than government-set retail prices. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON>, 35, was arrested in September 1985 and sentenced to death in March 1987. He appealed the verdict, but the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month upheld the lower court's ruling.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he's ready to talk to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about American hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` if they're ready.'' At the conclusion of a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring young men selected by the American Legion to study politics and government, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked `` are you ready to talk to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about the hostages? Is it time.'' `` If they're willing and ready to talk, it's time,'' he said. An administration official said earlier today that despite a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> message last week, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> still has not sent an `` authorized'' reply to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> entreaties about talks on normalizing relations after an eight-year lapse. The message reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desires to discuss ties with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and did not lay down conditions for a resumption of relations, broken in April 1980, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, the nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and terrorism. He said, however, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not imposed conditions for talks. In any event, the official said, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> had not proposed an `` authorized representative'' to respond to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overtures. On Sunday, two senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the administration deserves much of the credit for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a cease-fire in its long war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` This is a time, if not for bragging, at least it's been a time for all of us to be proud that our policy has been a success,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, deputy secretary of state, said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> agreed and said a cease-fire means the year-old policy of escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> will end `` as soon as we judge it safe -LRB- and -RRB- prudent to do so.'' But <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Meet the Press,'' refused to set a date for the reduction of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in the waterway. There are 27 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships there, compared with the five or six that patrolled the gulf before the convoys began. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also said improved U.S.-Iranian relations could lead to the release of the nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by Iranian-backed groups. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has accepted <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in the eight-year war while the two sides try to negotiate a lasting peace. Even as representatives of both countries prepare to meet with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has launched a new series of attacks against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said, `` Certainly <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision is not solely attributable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, but our firmness of our military presence in the gulf, our indication that we planned to stay there as long as it was necessary, and at the same time our diplomatic track, principally at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, has finally achieved success.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, asked about the impact of administration policy on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, said, `` I think it's been quite significant. Do n't forget that -LRB- Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has consistently said that he was going to drive us from the gulf.'' `` The fact that we have been resolute, that we have stood by our friends, that we have stood by the principles of freedom of navigation and that he has not been able to drive us from the gulf has had a significant impact on Iranian thinking,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. One result of a cease-fire will be an end to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s protection of tankers in the gulf, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, although he declined to be specific about when that would occur The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has run 49 convoys. `` It's a little hard to make that kind of judgment at this point,'' he said when asked about a date. `` We want to watch the negotiations. We'd probably want to take some reasonable interval to make certain that the cease-fire holds,'' he said. `` But there's no desire to keep 27 ships there any longer than possible. We would certainly draw down -LRB- the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships -RRB- as soon as feasible.'' Ending the war eventually could lead to better relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, both men said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has taken a number of steps in recent weeks to improve relations with other countries. `` We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` All they have to do is designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and we'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, about terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever is appropriate.'' Asked about reports the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages might be released if the war ends, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, `` We're obviously not going to discuss any quid pro quo, but if the Iranians want to talk to us about the hostage situation and how they're going to go about influencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it. I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, asked about the same reports, said, `` I have no information -LRB- to indicate the reports are true -RRB-.'' But he added that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution means `` we may be beginning a process in which we can begin a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about the subjects of grave concern to us, of which the hostages and terrorism are at the very top of our agenda.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Sunday the hostage situation is easy for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to resolve. `` All they have to do is release them.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said, `` We are willing to talk to anybody, anyplace, but we are not willing to negotiate. We are not willing to pay ransom. There is no need.''

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s warring parties held peace talks Monday for the first time, but they apparently made no progress on negotiating an end to the country's civil war. The two central problems to be tackled are the future of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and organizing elections for a new Cambodian government. `` Although we have not solved any concrete problems, each side has revealed its position to the other side, `` said Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> after talks with the three guerrilla groups, which oppose his Vietnamese-installed government. The four Cambodian leaders gathered in the summer palace of the late President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, a mountain retreat 37 miles outside <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, for the so-called `` cocktail party'' of the factions. `` This is a very preliminary stage,'' said <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, who organized the meeting. On Monday, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> met with guerrilla leaders <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samthan </PERSON> of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, who represented his father Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The four later were joined by representatives of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, its close ally <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> _ which is the main backer of the guerrillas. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 and by Western count maintains more than 100,000 troops there, says it has withdrawn several thousand soldiers. It has announced it will pull out 50,000 troops this year and the rest by early 1990. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told reporters he presented a seven-point proposal for a political settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The plan contains mostly positions that already had been rejected by the guerrillas. It calls for maintaining the status-quo in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> until elections are organized to form a new government. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has said he can not accept the guerrillas' demand that he dissolve his government before the elections. Instead, he said he proposed forming a `` ntional reconciliation council'' headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to implement any peace agreements and organize the elections. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> resigned July 10 as the president of the guerrilla coalition because he said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> were killing his men. He arrived in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> on Saturday as a guest of President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, but said he would not attend the <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> talks. The prince is considered the central figure in a settlement and future government, and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said the leaders of all four factions would meet him in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> in the next few days. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> also demanded the dissolution of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the guerrilla forces. `` Only by eliminating the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ... can we eliminate the possibility of the <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> regime returning to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said. From 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded, the fanatical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime of Prime Minister Pol Pot killed hundreds of thousands of people. Diplomats say the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is storing arms for attacks after the Vietnamese troops leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The meeting represents the first gathering of the four Cambodian parties. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> held two rounds of unsuccessful talks since 1987, but <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has never met with the factions of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance. Asked if he was happy with the talks, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s delegate, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said, `` I am optimistic. I do n't say happy, but optimistic. Three Buddhist monks from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> chanted prayers for the success of the talks outside the Dutch colonial palace where the meetings were held. <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> said the meeting is to continue Tuesday and would last `` as long as it takes.'' The tentative schedule called for two days of talks.

Although he was a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> loyalist, <PERSON> McClory </PERSON> was one of the leading House supporters of an article of impeachment in 1974 charging <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> with abusing his constitutional powers in the Watergate matter. He drafted another article charging the president with contempt of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for resisting subpoenas. `` I feel really torn,'' <PERSON> McClory </PERSON> said in an interview at the time. `` But I'm disassociating this job from my relationship with the president on philosophy and policies.'' During the impeachment hearings, <PERSON> McClory </PERSON> said he was not convinced that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was directly involved in the Watergate coverup but rejected suggestions that he had a partisan obligation to defend the president against all of the accusations. `` I have heard it said by some that they can not understand how a Republican could vote to impeach a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president,'' he said in the committee's opening debate on impeachment. `` Let me hasten to assert that that argument demeans my role here. It would make a mockery of our entire inquiry.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned the presidency after the committee voted three articles of impeachment. Born in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McClory </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and practiced law in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area until 1950 when he was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>.

Rather than opposing incumbent Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, also a Republican, in the expanded 10th District, he chose not to seek re-election in 1982. `` He will be best remembered for his leadership during the Watergate hearings and his abiding commitment to the rule of law,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said Monday. `` Along with tens of thousands of people from our area, I share ... a tremendous sense of loss in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s passing.'' <PERSON> McClory </PERSON> had lived in the nation's capital since leaving office and was a member of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>.

 A practice space shuttle countdown hit a snag Monday, delaying a critical test-firing of Discovery's three main engines 24 hours, until Sunday The postponement was announced as engineers assessed methods for fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to take Discovery off the launch pad, a move that could delay the planned early September launch by as much as two months. The launch team started the countdown late Sunday and fell behind early in closing out the shuttle's rear engine compartment on the pad. That forced a one-day delay in the loading of gases aboard the spaceship's energy-producing fuel cells. The plan now calls for crews to pump more than half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Discovery's external fuel tank late Wednesday and early Thursday It will mark the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the fleet was grounded by the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986. On Thursday, when the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock liftoff, a simulated problem is to force a postponement. Crews then will rehearse what they call a 72-hour launch turnaround exercise. They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown and aim for a test-firing of Discovery's main engines at 7:30 a.m. Sunday. The 20-second firing, with the shuttle locked firmly on the pad, will check modifications made to turbopumps and other engine systems and is considered crucial to Discovery being certified for the first post-Challenger shuttle flight. The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early September, but the date is uncertain because of the leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main engines. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials believe that even if the leak can be fixed on the pad, the launch will be delayed past the middle of September. Experts were considering several ways to reach and plug the inaccessible leak, from cutting a hole through the shuttle cargo bay wall to running a snake-like tube 20 feet through the half-inch-diameter gas line. Tests over the weekend ruled out using the tube in two configurations. One would have used it to deliver an expandable Teflon balloon filled with sealant to plug the leak. In the other, sealant would been pumped through a hollow tube to the leak. The tube testing is being done at the Materials and Processing Laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. Lab director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinghamer </PERSON> said Monday the balloon and hollow tube approaches proved impractical. But he said another approach, in which a badminton-like shuttlecock is attached to the end of the `` snake,'' showed promise in reaching the leak. `` We have tested it eight times successfully and it looks very attractive,'' <PERSON> Schwinghamer </PERSON> said. He suggested that if this method did n't work, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> then could consider cutting a hole in the cargo bay.

However, the benefit game Sunday between the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> teams had some of the trappings of major league baseball. There were at least four inside-the-park home runs and some spectacular fielding plays during the game won by the IR team, 20-13. A pitcher suspected of scuffing the softball was even ejected for allegedly concealing a huge wad of sandpaper while on the mound in the manner of Twins pitcher <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Niekro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Niekro </PERSON> was suspended for 10 days last year after being caught with an emery board and sandpaper on the mound in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The softball game was billed as a benefit between IR politicians, led by former state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> campaign, and DFLers, who were led by co-captains <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> and state Rep. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>. Each group sold about 500 $ 12 tickets. About 400 of the 38,008 fans who attended the Twins-Orioles game stayed to watch the slapstick game. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DFL </ORGANIZATION> co-captain and starting pitcher, was resplendent in iridescent purple, pink and green plaid shorts. She had some trouble controlling her pitches and was replaced in the second inning after yielding 11 runs. `` The most important thing, in politics as well as baseball, is to know when it's time to move on,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. In the fifth inning, with the IRs leading 12-8, <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> complained about the IR pitcher, state Rep. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjornhom </PERSON>, and asked the umpire to check for illegalities. <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> accompanied the umpire to the mound, where a large piece of sandpaper fell to the ground next to the pitcher. Tjornhom, looking indignant, was ejected.

<HEAD>Delegate Says Burmese Leader's Resignation Accepted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling political party on Monday accepted the resignation of strongman Ne Win after 26 years as head of the party, but opposed his call for a referendum on ending one-party rule, a delegate said. At the final session of a three-day congress, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also considered sweeping economic reforms designed to cure the country's deepening economic woes. The 77-year-old Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military coup, announced abruptly Saturday he was resigning. He cited bloody anti-government rioting in March and June and his age as key factors in his decision. Ne Win has been blamed for leading <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into economic disaster during 26 years of isolationist policies. Five veteran party leaders also submitted their resignations Saturday. The party delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 1,061 delegates at the congress voted to accept <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>'s resignation and that of party vice chairman <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, also the country's president, but to retain them as `` inactive members. Official Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> did not announce the decision, broadcasting only remarks by party General Secretary <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> saying some delegates to the congress had favored approving the resignations. Political analysts speculated the official silence indicated division within party ranks on the course of the country. Ko also said the delegates rejected the resignations submitted by four of the party leaders because they were `` still young and energetic.'' The four included <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, party joint general secretary <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and central executive committee members <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON>. All hold senior government positions. In its broadcast, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said the delegates had empowered the party's central committee to consider sweeping proposals for economic reform. Th radio did not say whether a decision had been taken. In his remarks, <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> said 15 delegates expressed opposition to holding the proposed referendum on one-party rule on the grounds that a 1973 referendum already had institutionalized it. The state radio announced Sunday that an emergency parliament session would convene Wednesday, apparently to act on the referendum proposal. According to Burmese law, the parliament is empowered to rule on the referendum by majority vote. In the past, the parliament has rubber-stamped most of the ruling party's decisions. The emergency session Wednesday could also deal with the appointment of a new president to replace <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yu </LOCATION>. Exactly when Ne Win will be replaced or by whom remains unclear. Analysts have said a likely candidate would be <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON>, the prime minister since 1977. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON> has generally not been regarded as an effective leader. Many western diplomats doubt that Ne Win, who has been in undisputed control of the country for so long, will remain far removed from policy decisions even after he leaves the government. The sudden and unexpected developments in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> came in the wake of bloody anti-government riots that have rocked <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other cities three times since October. Martial law is still in effect in <LOCATION> Prome </LOCATION>, 180 miles north of the capital, following riots there last week. During his 26-year rule, Ne Win not only crushed anti-government opposition but moved against leaders within his own ranks when they exhibited what he saw as too much independence. He also is blamed for turning resource-rich <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into one of the nation's 10 poorest countries with an annual per capita income of less than $ 200. In a speech Sunday, <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> admitted economic production had declined, working skills had deteriorated and `` losses and waste can not be controlled effectively.'' `` Because of these weaknesses and as a result of adverse repercussions from the world economic conditions today, the state economic situation is declining,'' he said. He called for an end to state control of many sectors and for allowing joint ventures between <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> entrepreneurs and foreign investors. Ne Win banned such ventures shortly after seizing power.

 A man charged with illegally aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels pleaded innocent Monday and said his operations were approved `` all the way to the top'' of the White House. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, 47, is one of seven men indicted on charges of violating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Neutrality Act by secretly aiding the Contras in 1984 and 1985. `` This is a case of right and wrong,'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said after appearing before a federal magistrate. `` The soldiers are going to be hung and the generals will walk.'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON>, questioned why former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration figures connected to the Iran-Contra arms deal were not charged in the case, which covers a period when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned military aid to the Contras. Knowledge and approval of the aid operation `` went all the way to the top'' of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>. Asked if he meant the president, <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> repeated his statement. The former mercenary, who used the code name `` Colonel <PERSON> Flaco </PERSON>,'' said he received about $ 100,000 for the operations and added: `` it did not come from private sources.'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>'s defense also showed a document declassified during the congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair, saying it supports their contention that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was aware of the secret activities. The Jan. 27, 1985, memo to North, which is unsigned but which the defense says came from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s aide <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, specifically mentions <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>'s co-defendant <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, head of Civilian Materiel Assistance of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The memo says `` <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> is sending 4 people to -LRB- censored -RRB- to help with the training,'' and asks <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s approval of their departure date. It adds that <PERSON> Flaco </PERSON> `` is going to be working with the Indians,'' an apparent reference to the anti-Sandinista Miskito Indians on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s eastern coast. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said it was that operation that led to his disenchantment with the government's anti-Contra policies. `` They were not interested in getting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> back,'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said. `` They were interested in creating a situation in which the American military would have to come in.'' He said <PERSON> North </PERSON> had him thrown out of his base in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> `` with <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> submachine guns pointed at our heads'' because his operations were `` getting off the railroad track.'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> later began speaking out against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and in subsequent memos <PERSON> North </PERSON> wrote that he had to be stopped. A Terrell co-defendant, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, was sentenced Friday to one day of probation and fined $ 50 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON>, who could have sentenced him to 33 years in prison. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> faces the same possible penalty as <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, but said he would not plead guilty despite <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' lenient treatment. `` I wo n't take a felony,'' said <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said the defense would subpoena witnesses and documents from government agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Official Says Captains of Sub, Fishing Boat Share Blame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The captains of a Japanese submarine and a pleasure fishing boat probably share blame for a weekend collision that killed nine people and left 21 missing, a <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday. A senior defense official said the submarine's crewmen should have done more to save the people in the fishing boat and were slow to notify rescue officials. The 2,200-ton sub Nadashio and the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru collided head-on Saturday southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> while the submarine was running on the surface. Some of the 48 people on the boat were thrown into the water and the boat sank in two minutes. Those missing are presumed dead. No injuries were reported among the sub's 75 crewmen. `` The investigation is n't complete yet, but it looks like both vessels were partly responsible for the accident,'' the <ORGANIZATION> MSA </ORGANIZATION> official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Divers recovered the bodies of three more victims Monday in the waters near <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Rescue officials said 200 divers were searching for the 21 people still missing and others were on the ocean floor, attaching cables to the hull of the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru so it could be raised. <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON>, vice minister of state for defense, said the sub's crew was slow to tell rescue officials of the accident because its communications equipment only allowed it to talk to naval headquarters, not to the safety agency. Men on the sub should have `` grabbed three or four life preservers, if they were available, and jumped into the water'' to save people from the fishing boat, <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON> told reporters. Twenty-one minutes elapsed before the safety agency was told of the collision, according to news reports. Sixteen of the 19 people rescued were picked up by passing vessels and only three by the submarine, the reports said. One of those rescued died later. The Nadashio was crossing a busy shipping lane to enter <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> naval base and was trying to avoid hitting a yacht when it collided with the boat, which a company fishing club had chartered for the weekend, Adm. <PERSON> Shuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON> said Sunday. He said the fishing boat had not made an unexpected turn. Japanese maritime rules require the ship approaching from the left to take evasive action when two vessels appear to be on a collision course, with the other maintaining its course unless an accident is imminent. In Saturday's accident, the sub was approaching from the left and took such action, but the fishing boat also turned and a collision resulted. `` If the No. 1 <PERSON> Fujimaru </PERSON> had not turned to the left, there would not have been a collision,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official quoted <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON> as saying. `` I believe the submarine commander took the most appropriate measures to avoid an accident.''

<HEAD>Researchers Identify Genetic Defects That Lead To Colon Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers have identified genetic mutations that lead to the development of colon cancer, a critical step toward the development of better treatments for a form of cancer that kills 53,500 Americans annually. `` You can look at these genetic alterations as the causes of cancer _ just as you can look at bacteria as the causes of infection,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` Except it's more complicated in cancer.'' Just as the polio virus had to be discovered before the polio vaccine could be developed, so these genetic changes must be found before cancer can be prevented, <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview. Research so far suggests that perhaps as many as seven genetic mutations must occur for olon cancer tumors to appear, <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said. Five of those changes have now been identified, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Speaking Monday at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> here, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said that colon cancer appears to be caused both by the activation of known cancer genes and by the failure of certain anti-cancer genes. `` The steps in the pathway are starting to be filled in,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Understanding how these genetic changes produce colon tumors may allow doctors to distinguish between more severe and less severe forms of colon cancer in individuals, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, and could one day lead to better cancer drugs. White has been one of the leaders in the study of the anti-cancer genes that protect against cancer _ the so-called recessive oncogenes. One such gene, identified in a rare form of eye cancer, has now been linked to breast cancer and to a common form of lung cancer, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Another such gene was found by White in families with a rare kind of inherited colon cancer. Now, he said, failures of that anti-colon cancer gene have been found to occur in about half of the much more common form of colon cancer that is not inherited. Similarly, <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said he has found two specific genetic variations in at least 75 percent of people with colon cancer. He has also found that a long-known cancer gene called the K-ras gene is altered in about half of the colon cancer cases he has studied. `` That kind of mutation is probably very important for the development of colon cancer,'' <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said. `` And it suggests some relationship between environmental influences and cancer.'' Cancer is known to be caused, in part, by exposure to carcinogens in the environment, he explained. Such carcinogens could be triggering some of the genetic mutations that he and <PERSON> White </PERSON> are finding, he said. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said that some of these changes may produce polyps in the colon. These polyps, of the type that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had removed, are thought to represent tissue in which some _ but not all _ of the colon cancer genetic mutations are present. <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said statistical studies of colon cancer suggest that perhaps no more than seven genetic mutations are required to produce colon cancer tumors. With five of those changes now identified, researchers may be close to identifying all of the principal genetic causes of colon cancer, he said, opening the way to research on new and better treatments for this disease.

 An owner of a printing plant faces forgery charges in a scheme to print and sell $ 3 million in $ 50 and $ 100 bills, a federal agent said Monday. `` We believe we got all of it, that none of it was put into circulation,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmands </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION> resident and co-owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Reproprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was to be arraigned Monday on charges of manufacturing counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency and possession of forgery plates and tools, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edmands </PERSON> was arrested Sunday when an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent went to Reproprint after arranging to pay $ 50,000 in cash for the $ 3 million in counterfeit bills, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. `` The quality was average to good.

The quality of a forged bill depends largely on the quality of the camera that is used to produce a negative from which the printing plates are made, he said. `` The paper did not contain the red and blue security fibers, but it was a good rag paper,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said.

 Workers dusted off idled machinery, shops reopened and buses rolled Monday as Armenians in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> quit a two-month strike that failed to persuade the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to transfer the region to the control of a neighboring republic. One resident said Armenians wo n't give up despite the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership's rejection a week ago of their demand to take <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> out of the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and annex it to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` The decision has done little for us and we will continue this fight to the end. But what is the sense of continuing to strike?'' said an engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city in the Delaware-sized disputed region. The decision by Armenians to end the protest strikes marks a victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> in its drive to end the region's turmoil that erupted in February. The strikes have devastated the local economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Monday that at one <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> factory, lighting fixtures worth more than $ 7.9 million had not been produced since the work stoppage began May 23. The factory director was quoted as saying employees will work overtime to make up for the lost production. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 78.5 percent of the employees reported to work at <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>'s 15 major factories. But the news agency said it will take time to resume full production at the long-idled plants. Workers at a <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> silk factory spent two hours Monday morning cleaning a thick layer of dust from their looms and have other maintenance work to do before production is back to normal, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's parliament, decided July 18 that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, whose population of 162,000 is predominantly Armenian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, will remain part of the mostly Moslem Azerbaijani republic to which it has been attached since 1923. The Presidium, or executive committee, also decided to dispatch a representative to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to help authorities implement a plan approved in March for improving social and cultural facilities, primarily for Armenians. Soviet TV reported Monday that <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>, a 56-year-old member of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a Supreme Soviet deputy, would go to the region. Armenians in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> began sporadic strikes and rallies in February to press for annexation with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, contending they suffered discrimination under the Azerbaijanis. Strikes and rallies also erupted in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in support of the demand. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said buses began running again, food stores and other businesses reopened, and construction workers returned to their jobs Monday in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. `` Today people went to work,'' the broadcast engineer said in a telephone interview. `` Transport is operating and we have ended our strikes.'' She declined to give her name. The region's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials traveled to the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> to discuss with the republic's leaders `` efforts at restoring a normal working rhythm and strenghtening socialist legality and public order,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, most workers were reported back on the job after a strike that began July 4 and tapered off after last week's decision.

 Sikh extremists Monday opened fire at three leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, killing the head priest and a second official, and seriously injuring a third, police said. Police identified the dead as head priest <PERSON> Sohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiromani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurdwara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prabandhak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which manages <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine in the city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, police said. The head of the committee, <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghuman </PERSON>, suffered four bullet wounds and was hospitalized in critical condition, police said. According to police, the Sikh extremists armed with a AK-47 Chinese rifle sprayed gunfire at the three men at noon on a street in <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, about 55 miles west of the state capital of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. Police said the gunmen fled on a motorcycle. The three were shot as they emerged from a board meeting of an engineering college, Indian news agencies said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. A statewide manhunt was launched for the killers, said a <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION> police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The temple committee appointed the 60-year-old <PERSON> Sohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> head priest in May after police and troops forced more than 150 Sikh extremists out of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, which the militants used as a base to wage their guerrilla war for an independent homeland in the northwestern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. At least 42 people, most of them Sikh radicals, were killed during the siege. The head priest's predecessor and four other <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> high priests, who were jailed during the operation, remain in custody. The appointment of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a moderate, was opposed by the militants, who also objected to the priest's efforts to exonerate <PERSON> Surjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnala </PERSON>, former chief minister of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barnala </PERSON> had been excommunicated from the Sikh faith by radical priests in charge of the temple after he defied their order to merge his moderate political party with the militants. Police reported four other deaths in extremist violence in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The latest victims raised to 1,560 the number of people killed by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year. An estimated 690 of those killed have been Sikhs. The Sikh religion was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population, but they are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The Sikh militants claim they are being discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus.

<HEAD>FDA Ruling On Import Of AIDS Treatment Drugs Gives Hope To Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN VEGA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government's decision to allow those who suffer from AIDS to import unproved drugs is a response to the gay community's frustrations about the search for a cure to the deadly disease, according to advocates for AIDS victims. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, called the new program `` a signal advance in recognizing the gay and IV-drug constituencies that have been calling for this'' and grants AIDS patients `` a little bit of hope and reprieve.'' The government last week officially began allowing AIDS patients to import drugs not approved for sale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as long as the drugs are for personal use. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> revealed the change Saturday to a hostile crowd at the Second International Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He said the policy would also apply to drugs for other diseases. `` It's almost a shock because it's so contrary to the character and the tradition of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said `` It allows AIDS patients to make some choices about their own treatment,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which is sponsoring the conference on gay health issues. `` If you're dying, you do n't have a lot of choices,'' <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had been repeatedly criticized by advocates of AIDS patients who say the government is not moving quickly enough to develop and test new drugs to treat the fatal, incurable disease. Increasingly desperate patients have been eager to try experimental treatment, and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> was changing its policy even though scientists believe many of the drugs have not been proved safe and effective. `` From the AIDS person's point of view, they have nothing to lose and what they need is just some little optimism in their life. If there's a risk, I think that they should be able to make the decision about whether to assume that risk,'' <PERSON> Gostin </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, associate dean for education at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the change responds to gay community's frustration `` that answers are n't coming more quickly.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> cautioned that although activists focus on the bureaucracy as if the bureaucracy was the problem, `` The real problem is that nature is very slow and reluctant to yield up her secrets.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had previously allowed unapproved drugs to be imported on an informal basis. One such drug was dextran sulfate, which the federal government is only now beginning to test in human trials as a treatment for AIDS. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s new policy will insure that people in need can import a small supply, generally enough for three months of treatment. The drugs must be only for personal use and not for sale. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. Homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the 68,220 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases counted by the government since June 1981. There have been 38,541 deaths, or 56 percent of the total cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported last week.

<HEAD>Dairy Men, Cattle Producers Feuding Over Drought Relief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A simmering feud between beef producers and dairymen has surfaced as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrestles with legislation to aid drought-stricken farmers. A group of beef cattlemen based in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit concessions to the dairymen, while the nation's largest dairy farm cooperative says additional government help is necessary to avoid milk shortages and higher prices at the grocery store. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressmen, including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, to oppose concessions to the dairymen that extend beyond suspension of a 50-cent cut in milk price supports and existing drought relief assistance programs. Those programs include haying and grazing on land set aside from production and government-subsidized feed expenses in drought-stricken counties. `` Further concessions are unwarranted,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> wrote de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, a Democrat, in a July 20 letter. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskin </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the nation's largest dairy farm cooperative, said the group is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to not only suspend the 50-cent cut in price supports, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1., but to increase price supports by about $ 1.06 per 100 pounds of milk The dairy association contends the additional support is necessary to offset increasing feed costs caused by the drought, <PERSON> Eskin </PERSON> said Monday. Other industry officials say production has also been decreased because of the heat. A failure to act would be `` shortsighted'' and could result in `` letting milk production drop to dangerously low levels, which could lead to runaway prices for years to come,'' <PERSON> Eskin </PERSON> said. If farmers ca n't afford or obtain feed they may be forced to slaughter their herds, which can take three years to rebuild, he said. He said there has been `` heavy movement of dairy cattle to slaughter, further documenting a rapidly deteriorating situation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to complete action on drought-relief legislation Tuesday, with the bill possibly being considered by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Dairymen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Louisvlle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, cooperative is reporting shortages this week, and is 81-tanker trailers of milk below what is needed to fill orders in the Southeast and <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the cattle raisers do n't think the dairymen `` should be given favorable treatment over and above any other segment of agriculture. We're trying to maintain a level playing field for all agriculture.'' `` The secretary of agriculture has enough authority to deal with the drought situation. We're not really certain you need additional legislation,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The dairymen and beef-cattle producers have been at odds off and on for several years, partly over an 18-month whole-herd buyout of dairy cattle that began April 1, 1986. About 1.22 million cows, heifers and calves were sold, mostly for slaughter and some for export, during the buyout. Dairy farmers collected about $ 1.8 billion in subsidies and about 38 percent of that cost was paid for by dairy farmers themselves through milk marketing fees levied on all producers. The subsidies, however, went to only those in the program. The cattle producers contended the buyout flooded the market with beef and depressed prices. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, general manager of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisers </ORGANIZATION>, contends an increase in price supports could encourage production and lead to another whole-herd dairy buyout. `` We've already gone through that ringer two years ago,'' he said. A national consumer group, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, also said drought-hurt dairy farmers deserve some federal aid, such as feed assistance, but `` legislating a higher dairy support price is not justifiable.'' `` Once again, the dairy producers are going whole hog for a special deal that would cost Americans more as taxpayers and a consumers,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. `` And higher food prices impact hardest on those least able to pay. Mandating higher support prices for milk after feed costs slacken would once again encourage overproduction and government costs.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday the time has come for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to talk to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, if <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s leaders are `` willing and ready.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not elaborate, but an administration official noted earlier in the day that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had sent a new message to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week asking about the possibility of talks aimed at normalizing relations. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> still has not sent an `` authorized'' reply, the official said. The official, who asked not be identified, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, the nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and terrorism. But he said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> message did not specify conditions for a resumption of relations, severed in 1980. As he was leaving a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring participants in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>'s Boys Nation program, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked, `` are you ready to talk to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about the hostages. Is it time?'' `` If they're willing and ready to talk, it's time,'' he replied. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` there's really nothing new'' on the fate of the Americans held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reiterated that in the wake of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in the protracted Iran-Iraq war, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials have been hopeful that a dialogue could be established with the government of revolutionary leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said improved U.S.-Iranian relations could lead to the release of the nine Americans, including The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who has been held since March 16, 1985, longer than any other American. `` We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` All they have to do is designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and we'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, about terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever is appropriate.'' Asked about speculation the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages might be released if the war ends, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, `` We're obviously not going to discuss any quid pro quo, but if the Irnians want to talk to us about the hostage situation and how they're going to go about influencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it. I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> took the same stand in answering reporters' questions Monday. `` Our position remains the same, that we're always available to talk any time any place about the safety or the release of the hostages but we will not negotiate for them and we do n't anticipate any negotiations,'' he said. `` We wo n't negotiate. We wo n't pay ransom. We wo n't talk quid pro quos. We wo n't give or take,'' he said. `` The answer to release of the hostages is to release them. ... It's not a complex matter. ... They took them off the streets. They can put them back on the streets.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has persistently denied that his approval of the clandestine sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986 amounted to an arms-for-hostages deal. But a presidential commission headed by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, concluded there was such a linkage, and so did <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Two hostages, the Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, were released during the time of the transfers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which led to the subsequent diversion of sales proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels and _ eventually _ the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's worst scandal

 Palestinians clashed with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied territories Monday, and three Arabs and five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were hurt, hospital officials and military spokesmen said. The clashes came as the army released 148 Palestinian prisoners from a desert detention camp in a goodwill gesture for a key Moslem holiday. Most of Monday's violence focused on the seaside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, residents stoned an army patrol, seriously injuring one officer who suffered a cracked skull, an army spokesman said. In response, troops fired tear gas and live ammunition, wounding a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old boy, both in the legs, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed one shooting and said it was checking reports of the second. More than a dozen <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> residents were treated for beating injuries or tear gas inhalation, doctors at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. They said troops surrounded the hospital, apparently to search for protesters. In the Jabliya refugee camp, a frequent site of violence on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Arab stone-throwers forced an army jeep to veer out of control and turn over, injuring four military police, an army spokesman said. The spokesman said the driver lost control of his vehicle after a rock injured his hand. Two of the injured policemen were taken to a hospital and two were treated at the scene, the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with military regulations. The army immediately clamped a curfew on Jabaliya, forcing the camp's 60,000 residents to stay indoors. In the central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammar </PERSON>, residents hurled stones and bottles at an army patrol. Troops opened fire, wounding a protester, the army said. Doctors at nearby <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said the 22-year-old man was shot in the abdomen. The freed Palestinian prisoners were taken in five buses from the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention camp in the southern <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> to military headquarters in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where they were welcomed by hundreds of friends and relatives. When some of the prisoners went home to the nearby <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp, they were greeted by Arabs shouting pro-PLO slogans, and the army fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, witnesses said. Some of the detainees had been jailed without trial, and the rest had served short sentences on charges of anti-Israeli violence during the 7 -LCB- - month uprising Since the rebellion began in December, 233 Palestinians and four Israelis have died. The prisoner release came on the second day of the four-day Moslem holiday Eid al-Adha, or `` Feast of Sacrifice.'' The holiday marks what is described in the Koran, Islam's holy book, as God's request to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> to sacrifice his son, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> The army says 6,400 Palestinians are currently being held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, among them 2,500 jailed for up to six months without trial. The army said Monday it has computerized its prison records to deal with the dramatic increase in the number of Palestinians detained since the uprising. Lawyers have complained they spend weeks tracking down clients because of sloppy army records and indifferent officials. The English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted army officials as saying information on prisoners can now be obtained within two days. But <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, an Israeli lawyer who represents Palestinian prisoners, said problems persisted. She said prison officials often did not notify her about the whereabouts of her clients. Curfews remained in effect Monday in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalla </LOCATION>, where 10,000 Palestinians live, nearby <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION>, home to 12,000, and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city with 120,000 residents. Armed supporters of American-born anti-Arab Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, meanwhile, began car patrols of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> looking for stone-throwers. The group, calling itself `` The Committee For Safe Roads,'' already patrols the area around the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. The leftist Peace Now group called on the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to ban the civilian patrols. But Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said as long as the <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> backers carried licensed weapons and broke no laws, they could not be stopped.

 Sales of existing homes rose in June to the highest level in a year and a half as buyers tried to beat out rising mortgage interest rates, a real estate trade group reported Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.78 million units last month, a 5.3 percent increase over May. It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the highest level since homes sold at a rate of 4.06 million units in December 1986. In May, sales rose a revised 2.0 percent to a rate of 3.59 million units. An earlier estimate had put the gain at 3.1 percent. `` The anticipation of continued rising interest rates convinced homebuyers to get into the market now, rather than waiting,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, the trade group's chief economist. `` But, in fact, rates did not increase as much as anticipated, creating an added incentive for homebuyers,'' he said. Rates for fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 10.46 percent last week, up only about a half of a percentage point from recent lows in March, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The average does not include add-on fees known as points. However, many analysts are predicting rates will edge up by another half or full percentage point by the end of the year, curtailing sales. `` I would not be suprised if July gave us a level perhaps as strong as June, but I think over the remainder of the year, we're going to see those mortgage interest rates move upward and we're going to see housing market activity trailing off as a result,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> June sales were 5.6 percent higher than a year ago, the first time in 12 months that the sales pace beat the previous year's mark. For the first six months, existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units, up from 3.41 million in the last half of 1987. There were 3.53 million homes sold for all of last year, down slightly from 3.56 million in 1986, which was the best since 1979. Most economists are expecting sales of about 3.40 million this year. `` There's been a clear tapering off, but we are n't in the doldrums. We have n't had a housing bust by any means,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. The strong sales came amid other indications of weakness in the housing market. The annual rate of construction of new single-family homes during the first half of 1988 was down 6.4 percent from the July-December rate of last year. Peach said much of the demand for new housing that built up when interest rates soared early in the 1980s has been satisified. He said existing homes sales are still relatively high in part because of strong job growth and people moving to accept new and better jobs. The June sales increase was led by a rise of 9.2 percent in the South to 1.43 million units, followed by gains of 8.7 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 1.00 million units and 7.8 percent in the West to 690,000 units. Sales declined 2.8 percent in the Northeast to an annual sales pace of 700,000 units. The median price of an existing home rose $ 1,800 from May to June, climbing to $ 90,600, up 2.0 percent. The median price was up 5.5 percent from $ 85,900 a year ago. Of the four regions, the West had the highest appreciation rate over the past year, with a median sales price of $ 125,100, up 9.1 percent from June 1987. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> posted a 7.3 percent gain to $ 70,600, while in the Northeast the price rose 5.9 percent to $ 146,300. In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, home prices increased 4.3 percent in a year to $ 84,100.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has denied visas to 150 Jews stranded in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, claiming they are not Jewish by Orthodox law, a legislator said Monday. <PERSON> Mattityahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, a retired general in the Israeli army and a member of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, said the Ethiopians have relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and have waited several months in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital, for visas to the Jewish state. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish leaders apparently assured the Ethiopians the visas would be issued. The Ethiopians then abandoned their homes and most of their belongings to assemble in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. But ultra-Orthodox Jewish officials at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> decided against issuing the visas, saying the Ethiopians are not Jewish, <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are suffering because their families are divided,'' <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> said. `` Those who are mixed up in this have no way back. We ca n't just leave them hanging in the air.'' About 7,500 Ethiopian Jews were flown to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> four years ago in a secret rescue operation code-named `` Operation Moses,'' and about 10,000 Jews remain in that African country, according to official estimates. Immigration and Absorption Minister <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsur </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>'s remarks Monday as a `` blood libel.'' Israeli officials consistently refuse to discuss emigration from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, fearing publicity could harm the effort. <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> said his information came from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office of the U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that has been active in trying to help Ethiopian Jews emigrate. Part of the information he received was published here by the respected daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, quoted <ORGANIZATION> AJC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as saying the organization's head office was unaware of the matter raised by <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>. But an official source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>'s story. <PERSON> Tsur </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Clayman </PERSON> a telegram protesting the report, saying it `` shamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s name,'' ministry spokesman <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Ari </PERSON> said. `` I checked this matter with all the authorities involved and I was assured unequivocally that there is no truth to this report,'' the telegram said. Many of the estimated 16,000 Ethiopian Jews in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have faced discrimination from Israeli rabbis who often do not recognize them as Jewish, claiming they can not document their descendancy from the ancient faith. The Ethiopians claim they are descendants of the biblical King <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> and the Queen of Sheba who lived in the 10th century B.C. <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> said many of the Jews left in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> could be brought to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if not for <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials, who belong to the ultra-Orthodox party Shas and have sole jurisdiction over visas. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is allied with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> enemies and thus reluctant to permit Jews to come here.

 Twenty-two people were charged Monday with running the biggest Asian-based marijuana ring ever uncovered, an operation that shipped tons of the contraband at a time, federal authorities said. The alleged leader of the ring was British citizen <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, 42, previously acquitted of drug charges in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after claiming he worked for British counterintelligence, said interim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. Marks, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> resident, operated all over the world, authorities said. `` He was the <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> of drug trafficking,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Marks, his wife <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, and British citizen <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenion </PERSON> were arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on charges contained in an indictment which accuses all 22 defendants of racketeering, said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. For 17 years the group shipped marijuana from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and hashish from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and operated in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations, he said. `` They shipped in ton quantities, thousands of tons,'' said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. The group even bought its own ship, and amassed $ 30 million worth of property that the government wants confiscated. The traffickers allegedly laundered money through banks and corporations around the world. `` It's the largest enterprise ever uncovered involving <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, chief of the organized crime division of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. Police agencies from many of the countries involved, including <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION>, participated in the investigation. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a British citizen arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, is Marks' brother-in-law. `` Marks made a family enterprise out of it, using his wife, his brother-in-law and sister-in-law,'' said Cash. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said he expected <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to quickly extradite the Marks, <PERSON> Kenion </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Reaves </PERSON>, who was arrested several weeks ago in that country on a provisional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warrant. `` Unlike some other nations, we expect no problems bringing these defendants from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which has cooperated fully in this investigation,'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said.

 Monsoon rains and lighting killed 116 people in the past two weeks, including 33 members of one family, and destroyed thousands of homes, a government official said Monday. More than a foot of rain caused flooding that inundated 7,000 homes in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Arshad </PERSON>, flood relief commissioner. He said 1,000 villages along the <LOCATION> Jhelum </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinab </LOCATION> rivers in northern <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> province were flooded and more than 100,000 acres of land are under water, with cotton and rice crops the hardest hit. Lightning started a fire that killed 36 people, 33 of them from the same family, and consumed eight homes in northeastern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, according to Pakistani television. The storms also were blamed for one of the worst bus accidents in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> this year. A bus was swept into a shallow ravine Thursday about 21 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, killing 70 people, police said. Witnesses said panicked passengers jumped into the water and drowned.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition of big-city police chiefs and criminologists said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are throwing money at anti-drug programs whose effectiveness never has been tested. The coalition, in a letter sent to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, urged that money be earmarked for research and development in the war on drugs to find out which programs are most effective. `` We are calling on the federal government to do what it is not doing now ... to include money for research ... and bring reflection and thought to our policy on drugs,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON>, chief of police in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said at a news conference where the letter was released. The coalition said 5 percent of total federal anti-drug funds should be set aside for research and development. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve at least $ 1 billion for the war against drugs in the next fiscal year. Research could help determine how best to reduce demand for drugs, which treatment programs are most effective in keeping drug addicts from committing crimes and determine the costs and benefits of massive police crackdowns on drug-dealing locations, the police chiefs said in their letter. `` Throwing more money into existing programs will not answer these and other critical questions,'' the group said. `` We urge you to invest in better strategic knowledge for winning this war.'' The current war on drugs `` is characterized by defeat,'' <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON> said because of the lack of a coherent policy. Police need to know whether massive roundups of suspected drug dealers and raids on suspected drug operations are effective in deterring drug dealing, he said. The letter was signed by 46 police chiefs, sheriffs, law enforcement representatives and criminologists.

 A 26-mile stretch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 64 in southeastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is the first segment of a new National Forest Scenic Byways system, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Chief F. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the byway is located in the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and passes through scenic areas dominated by rock bluffs, mountain peaks and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocoee </LOCATION>. The biway also offers ready access to white-water rafting, boating, swimming and historical sites related to the Civil War and the Cherokee Indian culture, he said. The program was begun this summer `` to increase the scenic enjoyment of the millions of people who drive through national forests each year,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. Despite a variety of more active recreational activities, driving for pleasure remains the most popular in the nation's 156 national forests located in 43 states, he said. Various groups are working with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency to place interpretive signs, develop brochures and provide facilities designed to make a drive through the forests more enjoyable, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. A spokesman for the agency, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, said he expected `` probably three or four more'' scenic byways will be designated by the end of summer. He said nominations are due by Oct. 1. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> byway was the first to be nominated and the first to be approved, <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON> said.

 Backers of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who feuded for months over the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> delegation to the Republican National Convention, agreed Monday to greater representation for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s supporters in a show of unity that officials hope will ensure a winning GOP ticket in November. The agreement, reached after weeks of negotiations between the two factions, gives the former Republican presidential candidate 13 of the state's 77 delegate votes at next month's convention. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the virtual nominee, gets the remainder of the delegates. `` Having this agreement behind us now really clears the deck,'' said state party Chair <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>. `` It allows us to continue on using the time until <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to develop the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> campaign.'' <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> director of Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, said the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> camp was convinced a credentials fight over delegates would hamper the party's mission: electing the Republican ticket in November. `` Our differences are minimal compared to what we face in the fall,'' Ms. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> said. `` Proving we are right ... at the expense of having <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the leader of the free world is a price that we're not willing to pay.'' In the early stages of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s two-year delegate-selection process, the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> forces matched the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces in recruiting precinct delegates to the county conventions. That led to a temporary shift of party leadership, a series of lawsuits and in January a dramatic split at the state convention. Robertson-backing Republicans _ joined by some supporters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> _ broke from the main <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> group, held their own state convention and planned a credentials challenge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. As part of the agreement announced Monday, the renegade <PERSON> Rpublicans </PERSON> agreed to put the only remaining lawsuit on hold for nine months and the <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> agreed to give non-voting `` honorary delegate'' status to about 30 of the renegade delegates who have made transportation and hotel arrangements for the convention. Of the five delegates who relinquished seats, four were from the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> camp and one was a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delegate _ former Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>. In addition, two delegates gave up their membership on convention committees in favor of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has amassed more than the 1,139 delegates needed to win the nomination. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who returned to his evangelical television program since dropping out of the presidential race, has not released his delegates. The 13 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> delegates remain bound to vote for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> unless he says otherwise, according to Ms. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>. `` It has n't been made clear to me what his intentions are,'' she said.

 People who want to claim a body from the coroner's office will first have to identify the corpse in a photo lineup under guidelines established after a woman gained custody of a body to fake her own death certificate. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner now also requires people wishing to claim a body to show a driver's license and have fingerprints taken. Officials said that while they are sympathetic to grieving families, the new rules are necessary to prevent a similar scam in the future. The stricter standards came about after a woman trying to avoid creditors and probation officers gained custody of an unidentified body and tried to have her name registered as the deceased. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilch </PERSON>, were sentenced July 14 after pleading guilty to one count each of false personation, or creating a non-existent person. Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 35, received a two-year sentence, and Ms. <PERSON> Tilch </PERSON>, who is 58 and in a wheelchair, got 16 months. Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> used the name <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, called the coroner's office in December and said she was looking for her dead sister. The investigator asked for a description of the dead woman and Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> essentially described herself. Her height, hair color and general description _ a heavyset white woman in her mid-30s _ matched that of an unidentified body unclaimed since its discovery Oct. 25 alongside a highway. The woman apparently died of a drug overdose. Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and her mother were very emotional when shown the body. `` They were good at their craft,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Spada </PERSON>, a supervising coroner's investigator. `` And their craft was scamming people.'' The coroner's office, which handles 17,000 to 20,000 bodies a year, released the body to the two women, who had it cremated and mailed the death certificate to Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s probation officers, prosecutors said. <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> probation officer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> ordered a copy of the autopsy report, and the results showed the dead woman had undergone a hysterectomy and was covered with tattoos. <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> knew the two characteristics did not fit Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and called police. The dead woman's ashes have been returned to the coroner's office, where they will remain should the woman's real relatives come forward

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday voted to delay a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> requirement that shrimp fishermen use devices to prevent sea turtles from being snared and drowned in nets. Under an amendment proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., shrimp boats would not have to use turtle excluder devices in offshore waters before May 1, 1989, or in inshore waters before May 1, 1990 Approved by voice vote, the language represented a compromise worked out by <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, floor manager of legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Endangered Species Act. The compromise, which also provides for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> study of sea turtle populations and the value of turtle excluders, allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to begin debate on the endangered species legislation, similar to a House-passed bill. Backers of the Endangered Species Act had been trying for more than three years to get a bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to renew the 1972 law, which has technically lacked legislative authorization since Oct. 1, 1985. The House version of the reauthorization bill contains a ban on requiring turtle excluders in inshore waters before May 1990. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> last April issued a temporary injunction against the fisheries service requiring use of teh excluders in offshore waters. Conservationists argue that the sea turtle population is being decimated by shrimp nets. Shrimpers contend that excluder devices are dangerous to the operation of their vessels, reduce shrimp catches and are unnecessary for turtle survival. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders gave no indication when they expected to complete work on the reauthorization bill.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday that some features of drought-relief legislation violate principles he laid out for a package of aid to financially troubled farmers. In a letter to the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committees, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I am concerned that, due to the undeniable pressure to produce a bill as quickly as possible, some provisions were incorporated ... without adequate review.''

White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that administration officials expect <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to resume work on the legislative package this week. He said `` the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is a little ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but we're hopeful for good progress this week on the drought legislation. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got an updated report on the drought from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, who has returned from a 10-state tour of Midwestern drought areas. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> named <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as the fifth state to be designated entirely as a drought disaster area. The designation means eligible farms can apply for emergency loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Other entire states already approved are <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The White House press office said in a statement that <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with pictures the task force had taken of corn damage in several states. `` Pasture and hay are in very bad condition, causing real problems for livestock farmers,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Even the best corn is not in very good shape. The rains of last week are helping. But it may be too late for corn to recover.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> also told the president that `` some soybeans will recover, but there still will be large losses.'' The secretary said it probably would be another month before the government can make hard estimates of crop losses.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> told the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that she signed her 1986 candidacy declaration with the same signature that has jeopardized her 1988 candidacy. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, signed both forms with her middle initial, which is not on her voter registration card. And that was part of the trouble. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> also listed her Narragansett address on the 1988 form as 56 Central Ave., although, as her registration reflects, she actually lives on Central Street. State law requires the two forms to match exactly, and three minor candidates asked the board Monday to disqualify <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> because of the discrepancies. Two other candidates _ Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON> _ have been challenged on similar grounds. <PERSON> Sundlun </PERSON>'s hearing was scheduled later Monday, and <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>'s for Tuesday. Decisions on all three cases were expected Wednesday. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> and her attorneys contend her 1988 candidacy ca n't be challenged because her 1986 candidacy went uncontested despite the signature discrepancy. `` As I was about to put my signature on there, I asked my staff, ` How did I sign in 1986?' and they said, ` <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>','' she said. The 1986 form listed her address as Central Street, and the congresswoman said she did not know how that error was made. `` The best I can guess is I had a staff member fill out the form. Evidently, it's a typographical error,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Narragansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canvassers </ORGANIZATION>, testified the board refused to certify <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s candidacy because the law does not allow discrepancies. But <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said there was never any question of fraud. Earlier this year, the town and state board disqualified <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON>, a would-be <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate, from the presidential primary for the same middle-initial error <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> made. `` What was good for <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> should be good for Mr. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> and good for <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>,'' argued <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Staradumsky </PERSON>, one of those objecting to <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s candidacy. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s attorneys said the cases were different because <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> had relied on the earlier filing, and because the objections to her candidacy were filed by three people who would not be affected by the decision rather than by primary opponents. <PERSON> Staradumsky </PERSON> is seeking <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>'s seat; <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBreuil </PERSON> is seeking a state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who filed the first objection to <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s candidacy, is running for her seat as a write-in candidate.

 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s other military chiefs will meet Aug. 30 to choose a presidential candidate, expected to be <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, whose name will be alone on a yes-or-no ballot later this year A decree published Monday in the government bulletin said Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who is army commander, and the heads of the air force and national police last week set the date for their August meeting. Choosing the nominee Aug. 30 indicates the referendum will be in October. Under the 1980 constitution, the vote must occur no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days after the nominee is chosen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said in a speech July 7 it would take place in `` no more than 90 days.'' The 72-year-old general has been president since the coup in September 1973 that ousted the late President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an elected Marxist. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s fellow commanders are Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> of the air force, Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> of the navy and Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON>, national police commander. Their decision on a nominee must be unanimous, the constitution says, and if they can not agree within 48 hours, the nomination will be made by majority decision of an eight-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. If a majority of voters ratifies the choice, the candidate chosen will begin an eight-year presidential term in March. If not, an open election will be held in 1990, when congressional elections are planned. Opposition politicians expressed no objections Monday to a vote in October. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a Socialist, told journalists the opposition had expected the referendum to be held Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the coup, and a later date provided more time to campaign against it. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> is co-leader of a coalition working for rejection of the military candidate. It plans to make its own count of the vote with 20,000 volunteers serving as monitors at polling stations. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest, said announcing the nomination date so far in advance `` is good news,'' but he and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maira </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the government must take other steps to ensure a fair vote. A specific step they mentioned was lifting the state of emergency that allows the government to limit political activity and press freedom. This will be the first vote for president since <ORGANIZATION> Allende </ORGANIZATION> won the office in 1970. More than 6 million of the 8 million eligible voters have registered to participate.

 Police raided the homes of the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> and his mother before dawn Monday in a failed attempt to find and arrest <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>'s 18-year-old brother, the family and authorities said. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, to which most Protestant denominations belong, said police entered his home in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> at about 3 a.m. looking for his brother, <PERSON> Khotso </PERSON>. The minister, an outspoken critic of the white-led government, said police later raided his mother's home nearby and detained <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>'s sister, Salome, in connection with a book and a poster allegedly found in the house. Police confirmed the searches, saying they released <PERSON> Salome </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> after questioning. They said they could not find <PERSON> Khotso </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, but have long sought to arrest him under state-of-emergency regulations. The younger <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soweto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and was detained for three months shortly after the national emergency was declared in June 1986. Police have been hunting him for about a year, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>'s house was raided last week and two days later a hand grenade was found in her mailbox. `` I am deeply concerned that instead of investigating and finding the culprits who planted the hand grenade ... the police are harassing my family,'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said. `` Today, I felt once more that we are a people without a government, no police or army to protect us or secure our safety,'' he added. Police said the searches were conducted under state-of-emergency regulations that give authorities sweeping powers. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths of time without charge under the emergency. Emergency regulations also restrict reporting about unrest, security force action, treatment of detainees, most forms of protest and a wide range of statements the government considers subversive. Apartheid establishes by law and custom a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Philly Officials `Crack' Down On Suspected Drug Houses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 City officials cleaned out and sealed Monday the first two of 500 houses identified by police as crack dens, and neighbors plagued by drug traffic gave mixed reviews. `` I'm glad to see this happen because they would come to my house by mistake,'' <PERSON> Lavinia </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said from the front porch of her southwest <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> home, watching city workers haul junk out of a neighboring house and begin sealing it. Another neighbor, <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, was not so impressed. `` They'll just move around the corner, or down the street. They're everywhere,'' she said. A day before, Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> toured what police said was a crack house in the neighborhood as he announced a campaign to drive drug dealers out. `` We're going to harass them so much, arrest them so many times that we'll drive them out of the neighborhoods and out of the city,'' said <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, whose announcement followed growing drug-related violence in which children have been shot. Once houses have been identified as places where drug sales take place and raided by police, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said the houses would be sealed or demolished. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said southwest <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has about 150 of the estimated 500 to 600 houses in the city where the crack form of cocaine is sold. Employees of the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licenses </ORGANIZATION> and Inspections showed up Monday with dump trucks to clean out and shut down two of the houses, taking out furniture and everything else inside and tearing out gardens. `` What we're trying to do is close a couple of houses, to stabilize the neighborhood,'' said <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; I Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Plonski </PERSON>. `` Our department has made a determination that these houses are not beyond repair and that they can be salvaged,'' he said. Neighbors said no drugs had been sold from either house for the past three months. No one was in either house, and no arrests were made. `` They -LRB- drug dealers -RRB- stopped -LRB- dealing -RRB- before this,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 25, sitting on the steps of his home a couple of doors away. `` Them people ai n't dumb. Doing houses ai n't going to stop it. It's a big street. If they lose them -LRB- houses -RRB-, they're going to get another.'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 31, a mother of two from the same block, said the city's action would help `` a little.'' `` It's a beginning, but still more has to be done,'' she said, adding dealers had begun conducting business on a nearby corner.

 An endangered <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther, believed to be one of only five surviving at Everglades National Park, underwent surgery Monday to fix its mangled leg, state wildlife experts said. `` She was hit by a vehicle.

The 60-pound female was spotted limping by a passer-by who called officials Saturday. `` They found panther blood and hair and started to track the cat,'' <PERSON> Hoffstodt </PERSON> said. They had her tranquilized and shipped her to <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> on Sunday. Surgeons at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s veterinary school implanted a steel plate in the cat's left hind leg to stabilize its broken thigh bone. The plate was to be anchored by grafted bone from the panther's left front shoulder. An estimated 30 to 50 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panthers, shy and nocturnal brown cats, remain in the state. The injured female is one of five in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> park that have been tagged with radio collars. `` That radio collar saved the panther's life.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> reorganized her Cabinet on Monday, dividing the unwieldy <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and choosing a new health secretary from the left of her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The new post went to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, 48, who has been trade and industry minister, said an announcement from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office at 10 Downing St. Her Cabinet now has 22 members. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> is one of a half-dozen politicians regarded as possible successors to the 62-year-old prime minister. He will oversee the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, whose uncertain future is among the most sensitive issues of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s third term. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, a 50-year-old former deputy health minister, was brought into the Cabinet to take <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>'s former job. In what was widely seen as a demotion, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> took responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> away from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the social services secretary. She also removed him from a committee that is reviewing the future of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and is to report in September. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> changed 21 of about 90 ministerial posts outside the Cabinet, dropping six officials. The most senior Cabinet posts, foreign affairs and finance, were left in the hands of Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, ending speculation that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> might quit because of policy differences with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Among the non-Cabinet changes, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>, a vocal critic of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was moved to a job of equivalent rank in the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s five deputies, was succeeded by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, a minister in the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The first shuffle of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Cabinet since she won a third term in the June 1987 elections had not been expected until September. Aides said she acted early because of the impending report on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which was established 40 years ago to provide Britons with cradle-to-grave care. National Health costs $ 35.4 billion a year and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, including welfare and state pensions, add another $ 83.4 billion. The total is 44 percent of government spending. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, whose views are generally more liberal than Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s, was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Rushcliffe </PERSON>, central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in 1970 and appointed to the Cabinet in 1985. As trade and industry minister he shared a portfolio with <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the trade secretary and a member of the unelected House of Lords. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> also was minister for inner cities, whose revival Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> considers a major task. He is a Cambridge-educated writer who describes himself as `` one of the classless meritocracy of the 60s.'' Like Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a grocer's daughter, he is the son of a small-town shopkeeper.

 <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> underwent a four-hour brain operation Monday to seal off a ruptured blood vessel that could have killed him if it had not been treated, his chief surgeon said. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a pioneer in laser surgery who conducted the operation, said <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> could leave the hospital after a week and return to work in four to six weeks. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, 53, was listed in good condition. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, Roman Catholic archbishop since 1982 in the 550,000-member Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, suffered the aneurysm near the base of his brain Saturday while vacationing in <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. He was transported to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> for initial treatment, then was moved by helicopter Sunday to <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, a Catholic hospital. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> survived because his hemorrhaging stopped after the rupture and because of good treatment he received at the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> hospital, <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> told a news conference Monday. `` I really felt today like I was being guided. I never saw an operation go so smoothly,'' said <PERSON> Tew </PERSON>, chairman of neurosurgery at Good Samaritan. <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> said the medical team cut into <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>'s skull and used two 5-millimeter stainless steel clips to seal off the aneurysm, a sac formed when a weakened blood vessel wall bulges. That should prevent another rupture, <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> said. Doctors have bypassed the artery and rerouted the brain's blood supply to another artery. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> has an excellent prognosis and shows no signs of paralysis or other damage, <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> said. `` There is no damage to the brain itself,'' <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> said. `` He does n't seem to have any trouble at all right now.'' <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> said the aneurysm is the result of a congenital weakness in the wall of the artery, which gets thinner over time. About 40,000 Americans suffer blood vessel ruptures each year and approximately 15,000 of them die as a result. Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> is running the archdiocese in <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>'s absence.

 A man with nine drunken driving convictions was sentenced to the maximum term Monday for causing a head-on collision in which a woman was killed four months before she was to be married. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Tyngsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the March 1987 death of <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sant </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Dunstable </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> asked for and got the maximum sentence _ 3 -LCB- to seven years in prison _ arguing that <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON> had `` a total disregard for the safety of others'' and `` nothing else would keep <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON> off the road.'' Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalianis </PERSON> also gave <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON> a consecutive 12-month sentence for a lesser offense, but credit for time served already and for good behavior while in jail essentially wipes it out. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s sentencing memorandum said <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON> had been drinking at the <ORGANIZATION> Moose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> starting at 11:30 a.m. on March 10 and was `` shut off'' by the bartender at 5 p.m. when he was visibly drunk, singing and dancing. <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON> repeatedly refused offers for a ride home, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wrote, and drove down a highway where he hit two cars before colliding head-on with <PERSON> Sant </PERSON>'s car. <PERSON> Sant </PERSON> died in the hospital the next day. Authorities said <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON>'s blood-alcohol level was 0.29 percent, nearly three times the legal standard for drunkenness in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON> had six drunken-driving convictions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, one pending that later was dismissed, and three convictions in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, according to officials in the two states. He had lost his driving privileges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for five years in 1985, but had a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> license. <PERSON> Routhier </PERSON> said nothing at the sentencing hearing except that he understood the sentence. `` He'd rather be dead,'' said his lawyer, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` He'd rather have died that night than take the life of <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Olds </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tyngsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, were to have been married in July 1987. `` <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> was buried in her beautiful wedding dress that she was so excited about and the flowers that should have attended her wedding lined her coffin,'' her weeping mother, <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, testified before the sentencing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on Monday outlined modest changes in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting procedures designed to curb the types of abuses uncovered in the ongoing defense procurement investigation. The new practices place strict limits on what the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> calls `` Best and Final Offers'' that each company can make on specifc contracts, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told a news conference. In the past, contractors have been able to amend their final offers in consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to change prices or technical specifications to meet <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs. Many of the alleged abuses disclosed in the current procurement investigation involved contractors who, through improper activities by consultants, learned the price or other specifics of bids by competing companies, and used that information to submit a new `` Best and Final Offer'' tailored to win contracts worth billions of dollars. `` It is the Best and Final Offer that seems to us to create the most intensive point in the competitive cycle,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` And that means that information is at a premium.'' `` We intend to continue with our competitive process. But when you repeat it once, twice or three times, then it can readily become subject to abuse,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. Neither <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> nor his aides were able to say how frequently companies were allowed to make more than than one Best and Final Offer, although he said it was `` the exception'' rather than the rule. He said he envisioned further actions as more information is disclosed from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning lucrative contracts. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who was due to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday about steps he has taken to control contracting abuses, previously had announced many of the steps that he outlined Monday. Among those he mentioned Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has: _ Required that 17 companies implicated by the investigation to certify they did not engage in `` illegal or improper activity'' to obtain a defense contract _ Require those 17 to agree, in any new contract greater than $ 100,000, to include a clause allowing the government recover profits or 10 percent of the contract value if the deal is tainted _ Started procedures to lift the security clearances of six people, including one suspended without pay from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and five others transferred to other duties pending results of the investigation _ Drawn up a protocol for the armed services to follow when new information is disclosed from the investigation _ Sent letters to the top 200 defense contractors urging them to implement strong internal ethics programs, `` stringent management controls, and asking them to report back to us on their self-governance programs. _ Review Federal Acquisition Regulations to tighten controls on consultants employed by defense contractors _ Formed an audit task force to review the cost imposed on the military budget by consultants employed by private defense contractors <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the certification requirement was being applied only to the 17 implicated companies to avoid imposing unneeded costs on contractors that were not under suspicion. `` This is a rifle action. It is not a shotgun action. We are directing this at certain contractors. We do not intend to apply it indiscriminately, because it does impose a burden on people,'' he said. `` And where there are burdens, there are costs, and those costs may come back to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer,'' he said. `` It is only where we have reason to believe that people are under suspicion that we are doing this.'' `` We are going with a pre-award certification for certain contractors, basically those contractors whose premises have been searched,'' he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declined to identify people whose security clearances were being lifted, saying only that `` we are taking steps to revoke the security clearances of individuals who have been involved in illegal or improper actions.'' In a related development, the White House announced that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intends to nominate <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lohr </PERSON> to the new position of deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition. Since 1983, <PERSON> Lohr </PERSON> has been president of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Before that, he was executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from 1969 to 1983 <PERSON> Lohr </PERSON>, a 63-year-old native of <LOCATION> Revere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in 1949 and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, in 1964.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Legislature Should Oversee Defense Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Monday the Soviet legislature should oversee the defense industry and make decisions about how the armed forces are used abroad. His remarks to a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> foreign policy conference, reported by state television, were an elaboration of proposals Soviet officials have mentioned for expanding the powers of the legislature, the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said last month's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference set the stage for strengthening civilian control of the military. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the conference of 5,000 party members June 28 `` an effective constitutionally authorized mechanism'' was needed for a `` businesslike and competent discussion of international issues.'' New legislative procedures would bring `` all departments occupied with the military and military-industrial activity ... under the control of the highest all-people's elected organ,'' said a television announcer who paraphrased <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s remarks. The reference appeared to be to the Supreme Soviet. Supreme control over the military now is believed in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which works in secret without revealing its exact functions or membership. Official media have said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leads the council. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed in his speech to the party conference that a new, stronger president take over the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and make key foreign policy decisions. Conference delegates supported his call for strengthening the legislature by creating a 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that would choose a smaller standing Supreme Soviet <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the new legislature should supervise `` use of military forces outside national borders of the country and plans for defense construction and openness of military budgets,'' according to the television report. Bringing the legislature into decision-making on foreign military activities may be an attempt to avoid repetition of what some Soviet officials say was the mistake of sending troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. They say only a few Soviet leaders approved the intervention and did so without consulting specialists who would have advised against it. The soldiers now are being withdrawn under an agreement mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. A Western military attache told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the changes <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> outlined reflect an effort to `` have more people have a say'' in military decisions. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s remarks were reported only partially in the television news program Vremya. A report of the foreign policy meeting by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency did not include <PERSON> Shevardanadze </PERSON>'s proposals for wider oversight of the military

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> attacked two of his former top aides Monday, saying they triggered an independent counsel's 14-month criminal investigation of him by failing to conduct a `` competent and thorough'' inquiry in the spring of 1987. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that if Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had done their jobs correctly, there probably would have been no basis for independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> to investigate <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> recently concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` probably'' broke criminal laws on four occasions, but the independent counsel did not seek an indictment. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has since announced he will resign, probably by mid-August, and has pronounced himself `` completely vindicated.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said they would have no immediate comment on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attack. Both are scheduled to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the decision to launch a criminal investigation of him was based on `` hearsay'' from executives of the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and who had pleaded guilty to felony charges. He said that neither he nor `` to the best of my knowledge'' his longtime friend, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, was interviewed during the inquiries overseen by <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> abruptly resigned four months ago to protest <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure as attorney general in the face of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> are scheduled to testify about their resignations Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declared that `` the evidence now shows that if a competent and thorough preliminary investigation had been directed by the then-deputy attorney general and the former head of the criminal division, there would likely have been no cause for referral to an independent counsel.'' The attorney general did not refer to <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> by name. In the spring of 1987, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> oversaw initial inquiries by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity section into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> That resulted in an application to a federal court by <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s concurrence, for <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> to launch a full-scale criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on May 11, 1987. At the time, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> asked for the probe as well. Federal law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the integrity section found sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for possible violations of a law barring acceptance of gratuities. They also said further investigation was merited on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> aided and abetted a possible violation of the conflict-of-interest law by former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide-turned-Wedtech lobbyist <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. Had investigators spoken to him or to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, `` the hearsay'' from `` some criminals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ... would have been exposed for what it is'' and `` there would have been no need to even refer this to the independent counsel,'' said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s speech, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> acknowledged that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent had interviewed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in April 1987, but said that was in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> probe being conducted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, not in connection with the internal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities. According to the sources, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, also had been questioned extensively in the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> probe. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also questioned the motives of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> for resigning. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after quitting that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems had caused a `` malaise'' in Justice Department morale <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> disputed suggestions of low morale, saying `` whether the sources of these falsehoods are the claims of partisan politicians on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> or the self-serving statements of a few individuals who left the department for their own purposes, an objective look will reveal that such characterizations could not be farther from the truth.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also said that in regard to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation, `` never before has any independent counsel proceeding resulted in such a series of leaks'' to the news media. `` To be the subject of a relentless series of articles, based on leaks, which often turned out to be false or misleading, and to be severely restricted in my ability to respond, generates a feeling of helplessness and frustration that is almost beyond description,'' said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.

 More than a year after it began, the court-martial of the first member of the military to face prosecution on AIDS-related charges moves to its trial phase Tuesday. Pvt. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Caseyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by failing to use condoms during sexual relations and by failing to warn them he had tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of conduct bringing discredit upon the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and one count of sodomy. He has chosen to stand trial at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> before a sole military judge, rather than in front of a jury panel. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 17 years in prison, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances if convicted. He allegedly had sexual relations with one male and two female soldiers. One of the women, his fiancee at the time, Spec. 4 <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON>, gave birth last year to a child allegedly fathered by <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. A hearing had been scheduled Monday on one remaining pretrial motion, but the judge, Col. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, decided instead to hold that hearing Tuesday before the trial starts. That motion involves a prosecution effort to have <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> reverse himself on a ruling in May that would require one of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' alleged victims, known only as <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, to identify herself publicly when she testifies. `` She's requested anonymity and we feel a certain obligation to do everything we can to protect her,'' Col. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beans </PERSON>, staff judge advocate at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` She came forward and we feel uncomfortable about the prospects of having to reveal her identity publicly since we do n't feel it will add anything to the case.'' Court-martial proceedings began more than a year ago but were adjourned indefinitely Aug. 5 to allow appeal of a ruling that prohibited the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from using <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' AIDS blood test results. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s charges, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was routinely tested for AIDS in April 1986 after he reported to duty as a clerk at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, and was told that the results were positive for exposure to the HIV virus. A midlevel military appellate court reversed Cole last fall, and in March the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the highest military court, let that ruling stand. This spring, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was demoted from private first class, reportedly for use of marijuana, although officials have refused to disclose the reason for the demotion. Also in the spring, sources said, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> offered through his lawyers to accept an administrative severance from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> with a general discharge under honorable conditions. The Army refused. Since court-martial proceedings began against <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, several other military members have been charged, have entered pleas or have been convicted of AIDS-related charges. They include a soldier at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who pleaded guilty to charges including disobeying an officer; another at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault; an airman at <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who was convicted of aggravated assault; and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer acquitted of assault and adultery in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> case. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> have instituted regulations ordering commanding officers to inform any soldier or airman testing positive for exposure to the AIDS virus that failure to inform all sex partners of the test results and to practice safe sex will bring discharge or prosecution. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> instituted a similar legal advisory policy, but it apparently does not require commanding officers to issue a warning, according to a spokesman.

 The only one of five enlisted <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> instructors charged with involuntary manslaughter in the training death of a 19-year-old recruit pleaded innocent Monday. A military judge also set an Aug. 29 trial date in the court-martial of Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, but said he may delay it if a defense lawyer could not appear because of his wife's illness. If the date stands, <ORGANIZATION> Combe </ORGANIZATION>'s trial would start a week after that of Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, officer in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died March 2. Four other enlisted instructors were charged only with conspiracy to commit battery and received nonjudicial punishments including reductions in rank and loss of pay. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> also was offered nonjudicial punishment but chose a court-martial in an effort to clear himself. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, however, received no choice. His court-martial was ordered by Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education an training, following an investigative hearing last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has accused <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water after he was pushed into the pool. Besides manslaughter, <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> is charged with battery and conspiracy to commit battery. Instructors allegedly forced <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> into a pool after he had panicked, climbed out, held on to an equipment rack and shouted that he was quitting the course. At the investigative hearing, a pathologist testified that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia about being dragged under water, which triggered heart failure followed by drowning. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was taking part in a practice rescue in which the instructors, playing the role of panicked air crash victims, grasped recruits in a head-hold. Witnesses at the hearing gave conflicting testimony on whether <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Combe </LOCATION>'s grasp or had extricated himself from the instructor's head-hold when he collapsed. The military judge, Cmdr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Radlinski </PERSON>, denied a request by defense lawyers to delay the trial until late September. Prosecutor Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had argued for starting the trial as early as Monday.

 The nation's hen flock worked a little harder last month, but because of fewer birds the extra effort fell short of the year-ago production mark, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. June output was estimated at 5.52 billion eggs, down 2 percent from June 1987, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, the number of hens in laying flocks declined 3 percent during the month to an average of 269 million birds. Individually, however, the fewer hens shelled out more eggs _ an average of 2,054 eggs per 100 birds during June, up from 2,033 a year earlier, the report said.

<HEAD>Angry Words Over Experiment with Inexplicable Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bitter words circulated in the scientific community Monday over reports that this week's edition of a respected science journal will debunk an experiment that defies scientific theory. The experiment baffled researchers because it appeared to use sound methods to prove the impossible: that natural proteins called antibodies that react with certain blood cells will continue to react when diluted far beyond the point where they should theoretically be able to do so. Nature, a science weekly, published the antibody findings in its June 30 edition, but in an unusual `` editorial reservation'' declared: `` There is no physical basis for such an activity.'' It said experts it later chose to review the research did not believe the result, but could not fault the conduct of the experiments, and the journal promised to have independent investigators observe repetitions of the experiments. The report of the investigation is to appear in this week's edition of Nature and advance word, leaked to the French press, is that it dismisses the experiment as fanciful, poorly conducted and of no scientific value Editors of Nature have refused comment, but sources at the magazine confirmed privately that an article will appear that discredits the experiment. They also confirmed reports that Nature's independent investigators were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Randi </PERSON>, a professional magician from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> known for studying unusual scientific claims, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, an investigator of scientific fraud. `` Nature is going to produce a totally and completely negative report on the experiment,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> of the French medical institute <ORGANIZATION> INSERM </ORGANIZATION>, who produced the inexplicable results at his <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> laboratory. Researchers in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> say they have duplicated <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON>'s results. <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> and the sources at Nature magazine both said the report does not suggest cheating was involved. <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> said in a telephone interview he had seen Nature's article and `` I do n't consider it as serious I think it will harm Nature.'' <PERSON> Randi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> `` made an enormous amount of mistakes that I will outline in my answer to Nature,'' <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON> said, adding that the controls the investigators used were inadequate. Controls are special samples used in laboratories to check testing procedures. Quoting from the rebuttal he is sending to Nature, <PERSON> Beneviste </PERSON> said: `` All in all, the judgment is based on one dilution series, tested on two bloods, in awful technical and psychological conditions. Outrageous.'' He would not specify what Nature's article says because the magazine has not yet released it publicly, but quoted a passage he said would `` make their whole report auto-destruct.'' As quoted by <PERSON> Beneviste </PERSON>, the passage says: `` Thus we believe that many of the experiments whose results are regarded as significant are artifacts of statistical noise. But plainly this does n't apply to all the data _ for example the fourth experiment in the series.'' That means the investigators had failed to discredit all the experiments, he said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortner </PERSON>, an immunology research associate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>, which reported duplicating the experiment, said last month: `` It's unbelievable and it breaks all rules.'' She said in an interview at the time that the supposedly impossible reaction occurs even at extreme levels of dilution when theoretically no antibody molecules are left in the solution. `` This has really shaken up our world,'' she said. `` Even people who have seen this phenomenon find it hard to believe.''

 Guerrillas attacked and set fire to a bowling alley in the capital Monday in response to the police disruption of an anti-government march, the establishment's manager said No one was reported hurt. No group made independent claims of responsibility for the attack. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Bolerama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jardin </ORGANIZATION>, said 10 to 12 masked men with pistols and at least one submachine gun burst into the bowling alley and identified themselves as `` urban commandos'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front, a coalition of five guerrilla groups, has waged an 8-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government, but the fighting in recent years has been largely restricted to the countryside. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said the guerrillas made the about 30 patrons `` lie face down on the floor and took from them money they said was a ` contribution' to the cause. They said the attack was in reprisal for the government's repression of Thursday's march.'' The guerrillas then doused several pool tables in a room adjoining the main bowling area with gasoline and set them afire, and the flames spread, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. Firefighters arrived within 15 minutes and extinguished the blaze. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> estimated damage at $ 20,000. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said none of the bowling alley owners has any connection with the government, and that he did not understand why the establishment was selected as a target. Last Thursday, police used tear gas and fired shots in the air to break up an anti-government demonstration in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Protesters then burned at least nine vehicles. Human rights groups estimate more than 65,000 people have been killed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since the civil war began in October 1979.

 Arson investigators returned to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s gutted beachfront home Monday to examine the blackened second floor for clues on what started the fire that also heavily damaged director <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s home. Damage to both homes from the Sunday night fire along the <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> celebrity enclave was placed at more than $ 330,000. While the fire is believed to be accidental, the arson team went Monday for a second look. `` The arson investigators have determined the fire at the home of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> was accidental in nature,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department. `` They were out there late last night, but decided to go out again today to see if they could find out how it started.'' <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>; his actress-wife, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>; and their son, <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, were n't in the house and there were no injuries, authorities said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> also was n't home, but arrived as firefighters were mopping up. One investigator said film stored at <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s house may have been a factor. Damage to the <LOCATION> Spielberg </LOCATION> home was estimated at $ 210,000, <PERSON> Reyna </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s residence next door sustained $ 120,000 in damage, with about 30 percent of the home destroyed. It took 40 firefighters about 40 minutes to extinguish the blaze, which broke out about 6:40 p.m.. Other celebrity residents along the mile-long section of <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> include <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and Goldie Hawn The Broad Beach homes range between $ 3 million and $ 10 million in value. The fire, which could be seen for miles along <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION>, attracted hundreds of onlookers and sheriff's deputies had to be called to clear a path for emergency vehicles, authorities said. <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> is about 30 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Among <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s hit films as producer or director are `` Jaws,'' `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' `` Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' `` E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial,'' `` Empire of the Sun,'' `` The Color Purple'' and the recently released `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> produced and directed `` Red Heat,'' the current hit starring <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>. His directing credits include `` 48 Hrs.,'' `` The Warriors,'' and `` Extreme Prejudice,'' and he co-produced the popular science fiction thrillers `` Alien'' and `` Aliens.

<HEAD>Dukakis Cheered at Office, But Faces Federal Funding Delay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted by cheering <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state employees Monday when he returned to the governor's office for the first time since winning the Democratic presidential nomination. But a Republican complaint was likely to force him to wait for $ 46 million in federal campaign funds. `` This will probably add some time to the deliberative process,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said of a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> request that federal money be held up until the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> can rule on questions raised by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s pursuit of the vice presidency and re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at the same time. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was off the campaign trail after winding up a trip Sunday night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was polishing a speech in which he planned to call for tougher ethical standards for government officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. As for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s races, <PERSON> Jann </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsten </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday, `` There is no question that one is going to impact the other.'' `` A dollar spent by Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, whether for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the vice presidential campaign, is going to directly and immediately benefit both,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION>. `` It just is n't fair.'' An unusual <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law permits <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to run for vice president at the same time he is on the ballot for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s latest campaign report showed him with $ 3.9 million on hand for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race against <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>. While there is no lid on how much he can spend on his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign, federal law limits direct expenditures in the presidential campaign to the federal campaign funds _ divided equally between the major party candidates. <PERSON> Dukkais </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> shrugged off the possible delay in receipt of the $ 46 million. `` Our campaign is moving full steam ahead with plenty of momentum from the convention,'' he said. One sign of the kind of momentum cheering the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was a new poll taken in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. The survey of 502 likely voters on Friday and Saturday, the two days immediately following the Democratic Convention, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored by 50 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 40 percent. The survey had a margin of error of 4 percent. A pre-convention survey in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> had the two candidates tied at 46 percent each. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending the week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, attending to official duties. He will deliver a speech Tuesday at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on ethics in government, prescribing `` high standards'' to prevent conflict of interest by federal officials, including members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Aides say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants a strengthened office of ethics in the White House. The speech, long in the making, was delayed until the release of the report by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> on Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, which said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a criminal conflict-of-interest statute. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> sought no charges. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in particular, must be above even the appearance of wrongdoing. `` I would have to reluctantly conclude _ reluctantly because I like <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> _ that those standards were not met,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters last Saturday. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Statehouse shortly before 9 a.m., about 20 state employees greeted him with applause. Once in his office, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took up where he left off before the convention and became immersed in efforts to defuse legislative protests over his use of a line-item veto to bring the state budget into balance. Some legislators were calling for a special session to try to override some of his vetoes of $ 138 million in appropriations. Meanwhile, at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that it is likely President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto plant-closing legislation that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been making an issue in the presidential campaign. `` It's always open until it's done,'' said the spokesman when asked if there were a chance <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would change his position on the legislation that would require companies to give employees and communities 60 days notice before shutting down a plant.

<TEXT>
 In a July 5 story about a motion to reduce the prison sentences of brothers <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Semler </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> erroneously reported that the men were convicted of illegally selling helicopters to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Semlers initially were charged with 27 counts of export violations, including illegal sale of helicopters to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. But in a plea-bargaining agreement, the Semlers pleaded guilty to reduced charges. The charge relating to alleged illegal helicopter sales was dropped. In addition, the article erroneously said a federal judge denied the motion to reduce the Semlers' prison sentences. In fact, the judge postponed his decision until after the Summer Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. If there are no serious incidents at the Games, he said, he will consider reducing the sentences in exchange for community service involving establishment of a camp for underprivileged children at <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Semler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> ranch. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> also reported the judge said he would `` never let these guys out'' of prison if serious incidents occurred at the Olympics. In fact, the judge said he would not let them out early `` on my own prerogative.'' The judge does not have authority in this case to extend the prison terms.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> lodged a strongly worded protest with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Monday, accusing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of violating peace accords and pleading with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general to end this `` license to kill.'' <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> charged the two nations with fanning `` the flames of war'' and engaging in `` blind terrorism.'' A U.N.-sponsored political agreement was signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, providing for Soviet troop withdrawal over nine months, non-interference in <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> affairs and return of Afghan refugees who have fled the civil war. The accords were signed by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which acted as spokesman for the anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas, and were guaranteed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The guerrillas did not sign the accords. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> cited in his letter to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> `` the new wave of ferocious and adventurist actions by extremists linked with the Peshawar-based alliance of seven -LRB- guerrilla groups -RRB- who have created appalling tragedies with missile barrages on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other cities.'' Major Afghan anti-government guerrillas are based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is the Afghan capital. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief to end the purported violations of the Afghan accords by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been aiding the guerrillas. `` The people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> expect that the means of interference and the shipment of weapons will stop and the license to kill shall no more be issued,'' said the letter, the latest in a series of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> protests by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Is it not high time for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, principal signatory of the accords, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the state guarantor, which still fan the flames of war, to understand the futility of blind terrorism?'' <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>'s letter said. His letter complained that on July 15, 17, 19 and 20, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> residents were killed in bomb blasts by guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. In the past 1 -LCB- months, it said, 177 missiles were fired into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing 75 people and injuring 98. The letter said the guerrillas want to disrupt the government policy of reconciliation, create panic among the civilian population, frighten refugees from returning to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and jeopardize the future of peace. It said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is carrying out the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords and Soviet troops are withdrawing on schedule, `` but brazen violations are being carried out by the other side.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been supplying the guerrillas with an estimated $ 500 million annually in arms and military supplies channeled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It vowed to continue the supplies as long as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> keeps up its military support of the Afghan government. The Afghan accords prohibit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s affairs. But weapons supply from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not banned. A separate agreement signed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> allows them to continue supplying their respective sides. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at the end of 1979 to prop up the pro-Soviet government and stayed on to help fight the guerrillas. The estimated 115,000 Soviet troops began withdrawing May 15 and are to complete the pullout by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Researcher: Tiny Genetic Defect Could Explain Origin Of Many
Diseases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Microscopic defects in the body's energy-generating system have been shown to cause blindness and might also cause major diseases of the heart, brain, liver and kidneys, a researcher said Monday <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said his research is the first to link a specific disease to defects in tiny chemical factories called mitochondria, which convert food into energy to support living cells. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> has for years been pursuing the notion that defects in mitochondrial genes could be important in many human diseases, and now he says he has proved his case. In a research paper that has been submitted to a journal for publication, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said he demonstrates a link between a precise, pinpoint mitochondrial defect and a rare inherited disease known as LHON, which can lead to blindness. `` I feel now statistically this is the right answer,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, where he is helping to teach a course in genetics. Dr. <PERSON> Berkeley </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, who is familiar with <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>'s research, said, `` I think it is an important step, but people have been suspecting this for a long time _ so I do n't think it's `` The work is certainly very good and demonstrates it -LRB- the link -RRB- very nicely,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The disease called <PERSON> Leber </PERSON>'s hereditary optic neuropathy, or <ORGANIZATION> LHON </ORGANIZATION>, is very rare, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. But he has also linked mitochondrial defects to several other rare genetic diseases, and he is convinced that these defects will be shown to be the cause of some major degenerative diseases for which the cause has not yet been found. Mitochondria are tiny structures inside cells that convert carbohydrates into energy-carrying molecules that can be dispatched around the cell to keep its machinery running _ and keep it alive. Each mitochondrion has a tiny set of 13 known genes that are entirely separate from the genes and chromosomes that carry most hereditary information, and that are responsible for most hereditary diseases. The mitochondrial genes are passed on to offspring only by mothers, through their eggs. Sperm carry only a few mitochondria, and those mitochondria are not incorporated into the developing offspring. Furthermore, they reproduce and mutate rapidly, compared with other genes, and thus the diseases they cause can appear and disappear in individuals and in succeeding generations, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. That's why it was so difficult to prove that they were causing disease. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said that cyanide is known to poison people by damaging their mitochondrial genes. Cyanide causes disorders of the brain, heart, liver, kidneys and muscle, he said. It may therefore be possible that genetic defects in the mitochondria can also cause such disorders, he said. In particular, he mentioned cardiomyopathy, a gradual weakening of the heart muscle for which there is no cure, except for a heart transplant. Its cause is unknown. Because mitochondria reproduce and mutate rapidly, it is possible that defects that appear during an individual's lifetime can trigger this harmful degeneration in the heart, he said. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> emphasized that with the exception of the few rare disorders to which he has linked the mitochondria, his ideas about the role of mitochondria in disease are speculation.

<HEAD>Senate Thwarts Two Helms Attempt To Restrict Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday thwarted two attempts by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> to eliminate or restrict the federal family planning program, denounced by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> as evidence of the government `` going out of control.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 65-21 to kill a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment that would have deleted the $ 140 million Title X family planning program from a spending bill for the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and Education. The chamber voted 54-34 to kill another <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment that would have barred all spending by <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> unless the secretary required by Jan. 31 that unmarried dependent minors 17 or under have written parental consent to get contraceptives or prescriptions for contraceptives from federally funded clinics. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also approved by voice vote a `` conscience clause'' saying none of the money in the bill can be used to require any person or entity to perform or facilitate abortions. The provision applies to medical personnel or denominational hospitals with religious or moral objections to abortion. The amendments arose during consideration of the $ 137 billion appropriations bill for the three departments. The money is for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. Title X provides money to states, local health departments and private groups for family planning clinics serving primarily low-income women. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> alleged that Planned Parenthood, a major recipient of Title X money, is using federal funds for abortion-related services and that in the last 10 years, Title X money has been used for `` secret sex programs for our nation's teen-agers.'' `` The federal government takes money from American parents and then uses that money to give contraceptives ... to their children,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` This is wrong. This is immoral. This is evidence of the federal government going out of control and moving far beyond what our founding fathers had in mind.'' `` Title X is not an abortion program. It's a knowledge program,,'' rejoined Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` I wish it were that all teen-agers would go to their parents for advice in this area But the fact is they do n't ... There are those situations where there is no home. Then who does the job?'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said lawmakers like himself who oppose abortion should not handicap family planning clinics in any way `` We'd be taking a step backwards, in the wrong direction,'' by requiring parental consent, he said. `` We would have more and more unwanted and unplanned babies ...'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor-HHS </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee, urged senators to vote their convictions on the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendments and not cave in to political pressure `` We all know in our heart of hearts how we ought to stand on it,'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said of the parental consent amendment. `` It's a question of how we are recorded on it ... Are you going to trigger some group against you or not?'' The abortion amendment was sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who said so-called conscience clauses currently are written into some laws but not others. `` Absent this amendment, persons involved with programs -LRB- in this bill -RRB- might or might not be protected in the exercise of their conscience in this matter,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` In some cases they would ... In other cases they would not.''

 King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> said Monday that he regretted the absence of Iranians at the annual Moslem pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and expressed hope of an amicable settlement of the rift between his country and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Fahd, speaking to leaders of Moslem delegations in a speech broadcast on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> radio, said: `` I regret not having seen the pilgrims of the Iranian nation participating with their Moslem brothers at these sacred spots.'' The Saudi king said Iranian pilgrims still were welcomed to `` the land of Islam'' and blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for decisions that led to their absence this year. `` What we hope is that these matters be settled in an amicable manner and that the Moslems be gathered together in one frame,'' he added. Saudi official figures released Monday said 1,379,556 Moslems _ including 762,755 from abroad and 616,801 from within the kingdom _ gathered this year for the pilgrimage, or hajj, which culminated Sunday with the start of the four-day Eid al-Adha or Feast of Sacrifice. About 145,000 pilgrims from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> went to Mecca for the 1987 hajj. Iranian pilgrims held demonstrations last year in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, despite a ban on political protests, and 402 people died, including 275 Iranians. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> said they died in a stampede, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused Saudi police of shooting at the pilgrims. Citing terrorism and subversion, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> last April broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has advocated taking away from the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal family custodianship of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, Islam's holiest sites. Saudi authorities earlier announced that the number of pilgrims would be restricted this year to one for every 1,000 residents of each Moslem country. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> boycotted the hajj to protest the cuts, and its government-controlled news media said demonstrations occurred again this year. The Saudis have denied those reports. Fahd made no reference to the Iranian reports of protests and referred only indirectly to the 1987 riots. What happened last year, he said, was `` over ... and thanks be to God, wisdom and logic prevailed and matters were put in their perspective,'' he said. All of the world's 850 million Moslems are expected to make at least one pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> if they can afford it. Mecca is the birthplace of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, the founder of Islam. Its Grand Mosque houses the <LOCATION> Kaaba </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrine. Pilgrims also made journeys this week to shrines in <LOCATION> Medina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s base for his 7th Century conquest of Arabia and the spread of the religion.

 The Kruegers of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, having paddled their own canoes through Arctic ice and past <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> alligators, pushed off Monday on the homestretch of their 21,000-mile journey to the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Verlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, 66, and his wife <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>, 37, began their `` two-continent canoe expedition'' on June 8, 1986, about 200 miles north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> and hope to finish in February at <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. `` I've always had this in me, wanting to be an explorer like <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> or <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Verlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, a former farmer and plumber who built the two 17-foot canoes in his garage at <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is paying some expenses of the 2 -LCB- - year trip as part of the celebration of its 150th birthday The <ORGANIZATION> Kruegers </ORGANIZATION> agreed to collect rain and river water for research by two chemical companies, and another company provided freeze-dried food. The two have paddled the icy waters of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> MacKenzie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and through the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, ridden the currents of the <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> rivers and coasted down the <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigbee </PERSON> Waterway into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> at Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` There were no precedents for us at all,'' said <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, who has covered much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on canoe trips. He and his wife rigged their two canoes into a catamaran and paddled 2,300 miles across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, island-hopping from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>. They entered <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, the canoes were surrounded by 3-foot-long iguanas, fierce-looking but harmless. Alligators and howler monkeys abounded in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. `` We saw hundreds of alligators,'' <PERSON> Verlen </PERSON> said. `` They have a disconcerting way of entering the water to get away and it looks like they are coming right at you.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kruegers </ORGANIZATION> said they do not speak Spanish but managed to get along by using a dictionary, hand signals and `` smiling a lot.'' One high navy official in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> issued an order `` that if anyone should see us, they should take care of us and feed us,'' said <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, a former technical assistant to a geologist. `` Our secret is that with a woman and a man with a gray beard, nobody feels threatened by us,'' she said. As for illnesses, `` We do n't have time to get sick,'' she said, and added: `` The only thing that really became a problem other than our sanity and legs was that our soap bars kept falling overboard.'' During a brief portage in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> between the <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION> and an <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> tributary, an army captain was so impressed by the voyage that he played them a tune on an instrument resembling a ukelele. They had to paddle 200 miles upstream on the <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> because high winds had blown water plants into a solid mass that blocked their path, and later spent 17 days without touching shore on the same river because of floods. From the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> they logged more than 17,000 miles, leaving about 4,000 miles to go around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>. It was sunny, but chilly, on Monday when about 100 well-wishers saw them off. Their planned route is down the <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, south on the <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, then down <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the Straits of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> and around the cape to <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Peres Supports Conservative Jews In Struggle Against Orthodox</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told Conservative Jews on Monday he feels control of the faith by Orthodox rabbis would harm Jewish unity. In an emotional speech frequently interrupted by applause, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has `` decided to keep Jewish life together as a matter of principle.'' `` We have decided profoundly, seriously and permanently not to discriminate Jewish people within the Jewish life and not to divide the Jewish people,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> represents 1,200 Conservative Jewish leaders worldwide. It began a six-day 88th annual convention Monday. Conservatives are struggling against what they contend is discrimination by Orthodox rabbis, who dominate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state religious offices. More than 100 rabbis demonstrated against alleged discrimination Sunday outside the seat of the Chief Rabbinate, which is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s highest state religious body and is controlled by Orthodox Jews <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> pledged to defend Conservative Jews against Orthodox attempts to pass a `` Who's a Jew'' law that would change the status of the non-Orthodox. `` Who is a Jew?,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> asked. `` I can answer it very simply. There is no Jew who can exclude another Jew from the Jewish life.'' His statements deviated from past <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> policy of cultivating religious parties as political allies. Israeli analysts recently suggested <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has abandoned hope of forming a coalition with religious parties after parliamentary elections in November. Labor faces a tough campaign against Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, with religious parties leaning toward <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ismar </PERSON> <PERSON> Schorsch </PERSON>, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, recalled a meeting with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> at which the foreign minister `` told us with gravity that the elections to come would be the most important in the 40-year history of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` Last week, Mr. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> enlarged the nature of his campaign. He entered the lions' den,'' <PERSON> Schorsch </PERSON> said, referring to the foreign minister's criticism of the Orthodox establishment in a speech Wednesday to 500 Orthodox rabbis from 30 countries. `` Mr. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> raised the issue of religious discrimination within that assembly,'' <PERSON> Schorsch </PERSON> said. `` By that exercise of courage he enlarged the campaign to include the issue of pluralism and the termination of religious terrorism within the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Federal Police Fire On Mobs In Three Cities After State Police
Disarmed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal paramilitary police fired on mobs in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state Monday, an Indian news agency reported, a day after the state's 59,000 police were ordered disarmed in a union dispute. No reports of casualties were issued. Paramilitary forces opened fire in the state capital at <LOCATION> Gandhinagr </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Ahmedabad </LOCATION>, the state's largest city, `` to disperse violent mobs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Both army and paramilitary troops intervened in <LOCATION> Ahmedabad </LOCATION> to end a stone-throwing fight, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It did not elaborate. In <LOCATION> Ahmedabad </LOCATION>, 18 miles south of <LOCATION> Gandhinagar </LOCATION>, the mobs also set fire to four houses, eight shops and three-owned buses, the news agencies said. The trouble began Sunday, when state officials accused police unions of fostering a revolt, dismissed 55 policemen for `` high indiscipline,'' ordered the state's police disarmed and called in the army and the federal paramilitary troops. Police unions called a strike Monday, but the news agencies said it was only partially successful. Paramilitary troops were reported patrolling most towns, and army troops marched in four cities, the agencies said. Police Inspector <PERSON> Ashok </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhatt </PERSON>, a key union leader, has been taken into custody under the National Security Act, which allows a suspect to be held for up to two years without trial. <PERSON> Bhatt </PERSON> was one of 55 policemen dismissed, and Chief Minister <PERSON> Amarsinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaudhary </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> Monday that more policemen may be dismissed in the next few days. The police unions have been demanding higher wages and better working conditions. But state officials said <PERSON> Bhatt </PERSON> and his associates encouraged indiscipline by police, even urging them to refuse temporary duty in the strife-torn state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. On Sunday, paramilitary troops took control of police armories in the state and the government ordered four of seven police unions disbanded, government television reported.

<HEAD>Pakistani Bishop Denounces Debate Over Biblical Miracles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Debates over biblical accounts of the virgin birth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and his resurrection have done more damage to the spread of Christianity in the East than have non-Christians, a Pakistani bishop said Monday. `` The theological controversies in the West can strike a fatal blow to the spread of the Gospel,'' <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwan </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Hyderabad </LOCATION>, said. He addressed other Anglican bishops on the ninth day of the three-week <ORGANIZATION> Lambeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Among those in the audience was <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s Bishop of Durham <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. In 1984, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> aroused controversy by suggesting the virgin birth, the resurrection and other miracles reported in the New Testament were symbolic stories and did not actually happen. The Lambeth Conference of 525 bishops representing the world's 70 million Anglicans, including members of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians, meets every 10 years <PERSON> Jiwan </PERSON> said `` disbelief in the bodily resurrection of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and the claim that it was only a spiritual experience of resurrection in the minds of the disciples raises the question of the authority of the Bible. `` The Bible is the divine source of revelation and the touchstone of Christian doctrine.'' He added it appeared Moslems believe more of Christianity than <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theologians who have `` laid down'' their spiritual weapons. <PERSON> Jiwan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> were among three speakers discussing evangelization and culture, but their subjects were not linked. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said Christian churches destroyed the credibility of the Gospel by competing to recruit new members. Evangelization must be wide-ranging, not mutually exclusive, and confront social, political and economic issues, he said. Christians should consider how their social structures, political policies and `` economic exploitations'' diminished them in God's image, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, the first African bishop to address the full conference, criticized church laws for allowing tolerance and pastoral care to divorcees while disciplining polygamists. `` We see no contradiction in extending pastoral care to divorcees, despite <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' strictures against divorce,'' he said. `` Yet we maintain a rigid disciplinary stance againmst polygamy despite <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' silence on the subject.''

<HEAD>Prison Escapee Convicted in Sadat Assassination Killed by Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police stormed the hideout Monday of a former army major who broke prison while serving life for the assassination of President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and killed the fugitive in a gunfight, the government announced. It said <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Kemary </PERSON>, 37, died in a shootout with police and two policemen were wounded but are in satisfactory condition. El-Kemary was holed up in a <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> apartment with two other prison escapees, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement. It said they also were serving life sentences after being convicted of conspiracy in <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s murder. A ministry spokesman, who was not identified in line with regulations, said security forces were searching for the two. He did not spell out whether they escaped during the raid or were away from the building when police attacked. Police called el-Kemary, a former officer in the armored corps, `` by far the most dangerous'' of the three. El-Kemary; <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamis </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Aswani </PERSON>, 31, escaped from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s maximum-security Tura prison on July 17. They pried open the cell door with an iron bar, overpowered their guards and fled in a waiting car. They were convicted of conspiracy in the Oct. 6, 1981, assassination of <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, but not of actually firing at him. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was killed by men in army uniforms while reviewing a military parade. The ministry statement said: `` State securuty inquiries showed that the escapees used an apartment in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s el-Sharabiya district as a hideout. `` At dawn today, the hideout was attacked. Its occupants met security forces with bullets and explosive charges, but the forces succeeded in seizing the apartment. The storming resulted in the death of fugitive <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> el-Kemary and the wounding of two policemen.'' It said police found `` a number of plastic bombs and the prison uniforms the three men used in their escape.'' The government has said all three men were members of the Moslem fundamentalist organization Jihad, or holy war. Jihad was blamed for <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s assassination and an attempted coup. In the turmoil following <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s murder, Jihad militants took over some government installations in the southern city of <LOCATION> Assiut </LOCATION>. Officials said at the time that 87 people, including 66 policemen, were killed in gun battles between Jihad members and security forces. After trials, three convicted assassins were executed by firing squad, two were hanged and more than 120 men were given prison terms up to life. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, has maintained emergency laws since the 1981 assassination. The laws ban strikes, unauthorized public meetings and demonstrations, and give the government wide powers of search and arrest without warrant.

<HEAD>New Regulations Adopted For Horse Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New regulations announced Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will allow horse shows for all breeds to continue, said a senator who had monitored the developments. `` The negotiations have been long and complex,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky. `` But I think everyone has emerged a winner. Horse shows for many breeds were closed earlier this year after the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit seeking enforcement of regulations, primarily for walking horses, that had adversely affected much of the industry. The regulations approved Monday permanently replace interim rules that had been imposed to allow the continuation of horse shows while the regulations were being negotiated. Major provisions of the new regulations include a new uniform standard for pads that would apply to all horse breeds; new rules on pad material; rejection of a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to further limit the weight of horseshoes; and new guidelines on examination procedures for horses exhibited in walking horse shows. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had solicited comments in April on the interim regulations. During the last several months, <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> sponsored negotiations with major horse organizations addressed by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> interim rules. The negotiations resulted in a joint comment on behalf of over 100 national horses organizations being sent to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. In the letter, the organizations recommended the new regulations adopted Monday. `` These recommendations were reached after weeks of negotiations with every major horse organization throughout the country,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said in a statement released by his office. `` Now that the regulations are permanent, horse shows throughout <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and the nation can continue without the fear of being shut down.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the world's first test-tube baby, celebrated her 10th birthday Monday with her parents and six-year-old sister <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>, also conceived through in vitro fertilization. The birthday party was held at the family home in <LOCATION> Whitchurch </LOCATION>, a suburb of the seaport of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. It quoted <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, as saying: `` One of the things we were most frightened of when she was born was that she'd play on the fact that she was the first test-tube baby But fortunately she seems pretty stable and level-headed.'' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, is a truck driver, and the couple volunteered for in vitro fertilization after they had been unable to have children during nine years of marriage. Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who pioneered in vitro fertilization with the late gynecologist <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, said research in the past decade was making the technique of conception outside the womb more available and less expensive for childless couples. In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said: `` The birth of <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was the first time that science and medicine had really come into human conception and clarified all the problems and all the mysteries of human conception. `` Now we have a lot of information ... Success rates are going up with the use of frozen embryos together with better fertility drugs ... and the cost is going down because newer, simpler techiques of collecting eggs ... are making the approach far more simple.'' <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> died earlier this year. He and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a physiologist, devised the technique originally to treat women with blocked Fallopian tubes. In vitro fertilization has helped produce thousands of babies worldwide, but the technique remains costly and uncertain of success and is available to only about 5 percent of childless couples. `` Most people do not get pregnant -LRB- with the technique -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said.

 Police seized 15 tons of hashish in a specially built tunnel between two <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> resort towns and made seven arrests, the civil governor's office said Monday. The office called it the largest drug haul ever in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Among those arrested was <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannavaggio </PERSON>, 51, from <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, who was said to be the brain of an international drug trafficking organization.

 Republican National Convention organizers said Monday it looks as if most of the requests for hotel rooms during next month's gathering can be met _ although initially, the demand was far greater than the supply. Monday was the deadline for state delegations and other groups which made their reservations through the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to send their deposits to hotels. By the day's end, it looked as if all those delegates, staffers and journalists would have a place to call home during the gathering, which begins Aug. 15. `` We've been able to accomodate pretty much everyone,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, a convention spokeswoman. Earlier, organizers had been swamped with requests. In fact, there were about 3,000 more rooms asked for than there were rooms _ and that had organizers nervous. But some delegations and news organizations apparently decided they did n't quite need as much space as they had originally sought. `` It's so hard to tell these things until it gets time for the deposits,'' said <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>. `` Mostly everything has evened out. Groups adjust their numbers, mostly downward.'' Monday was a busy day for hoteliers trying to sort out the new numbers. `` We're matching names to deposit checks, making sure the monies match up with the names,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosepink </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, where all-but-certain Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the delegations from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> will stay. He said 1,125 of his hotel's 1,290 rooms are assigned to the convention through the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION>. Virtually all of the remaining 175 rooms, including a bloc taken by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, are for news organizations and other groups attending the convention, he said. The only exceptions are eight rooms rented year-round by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. `` And even they are going to drop people off to attend the convention one day and then continue on their route to <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Rosepink </PERSON> said he had been asked for more rooms for the vice president and his entourage, and would give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> any rooms assigned to the delegations but not ultimately used by them. `` My gut feeling is that there may be one or two rooms available,'' he said. Many hotels could n't meet the demand without adding a wing or cleaning out a storeroom. The Hyatt, which will be Media Central, has booked every one of its 1,193 rooms to the convention. The Pallas Suites Hotel, which has 800 of its 1,000 rooms set aside, may be able to provide 30 to 50 more if renovations are completed in time, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the hotel. She said the remaining rooms are taken by permanent guests, tours which made reservations before the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> decided to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which booked the rooms on its own rather than through the convention. There are 25,500 hotel rooms in and around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> _ 19,500 within city limits and 6,000 in neighboring <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Langkopp </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel-Motel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Republicans blocked 17,500. Anything else, I'd think, would be just a normal transient movement. The businessman who comes here all the time,'' <PERSON> Langkopp </PERSON> said.

 A boat sank after colliding with a barge on the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and 71 people are missing and feared drowned in the second major boat disaster in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province in four days, it was reported Tuesday. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Yunhang No. 24, carrying a geological prospecting team from the <ORGANIZATION> Sichuan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, capsized quickly after the collision with the barge. The crash happened in <LOCATION> Yunyang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Monday. It said 25 people were rescued from the wooden, motor-driven boat. The accident occurred at 10:42 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported, but it did not describe weather conditions or give further details. Last Thursday, a passenger boat carrying about 250 people sank after hitting a rock in the <LOCATION> Min </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a tributary of the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. There have been differing figures on the number of casualties, but <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said late Monday 72 bodies have been recovered, about 30 people are missing and presumed drowned, and 152 people had been rescued. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Chongqing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> said earlier that the bodies of eight men 11 women had been found, but she had little information about the accident because of poor communications with the remote area. She said the company still does not know how many people were on board when the boat hit a rock in rain-swollen waters and sank. The vessel was carrying passengers between the towns of <PERSON> Yibin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Leshan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday authorities had located the sunken ship, which had been carried downstream, and divers had arrived. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been plagued by disasters on its overcrowded transportation system this year. Four train accidents have left 169 dead, while the crash of a Chinese airliner, also in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in January, killed 108.

<HEAD>Politician Apologizes For Remarks About American Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior official of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s governing party apologized Monday for remarks he made that implied that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks do not care if they go bankrupt. <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and considered a possible future prime minister, said his remarks over the weekend were `` misleading and inadvertent.'' In his speech Saturday at the party's annual summer retreat, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said: `` They -LRB- Americans -RRB- use credit cards a lot. They have no savings, so they go bankrupt. `` If Japanese go bankrupt, they would think it serious enough to escape into the night or commit family suicide, but among those guys over there -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- are a lot of blacks and so on who would think without concern, ` We're bankrupt. Now we do n't have to pay anything back,''' he said On Monday, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> issued a statement apologizing for his comments. `` In speaking of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personal consumption on July 23, I made misleading and inadvertent remarks, though in no sense did I ever imply any racial discrimination,'' he said in the statement. `` I very much regret that the remarks may have hurt the feelings of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends and withdraw those words with apologies,'' he said. <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister who held the finance and trade portfolios, is a powerful political figure known to aspire to be <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s premier. In February, he drew fire from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> when he said in a campaign speech that people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province `` have dug themselves into pits and are still living there.'' He later apologized for the statement. <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>'s comments were the latest in a series of controversial statements by Japanese politicians that have offended foreign countries. Two years ago, former Premier <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting that the large number of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> brought down <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s intelligence level That comment prompted widespread criticism of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and he issued an apology.

 A woman wanted in the 1969 hijacking of an airliner to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was arrested Monday by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who said she'd been living here under an assumed name <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, 39, had been living with her husband as <PERSON> Haziine </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> when <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested her Monday morning, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> was wanted for the hijacking of an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC8 plane en route from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Jan. 2, 1969. Authorities said <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> and her then-husband, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, took a 2-year-old boy hostage on the flight and forced the pilot at gunpoint to fly everybody on board to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. No one was injured. The plane carried 138 passengers and a crew of eight. During the alleged hijacking, authorities said, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> ran up the aisle of the plane shouting `` Black power!'' and `` Havana!'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, declined comment Monday when asked if <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> was involved with any terrorist organizations. Authorities received an anonymous tip last year that <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, but held off arresting her until Monday because they needed more time to firmly establish her identity, <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said. The couple remained in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> when the passengers and crew returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and were indicted on air piracy charges later that year. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> died in 1971 from wounds he received during a shootout with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police while fleeing a bank robbery. Authorities did not release information on how the couple re-entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A hearing to establish <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>'s identity was put off until Tuesday morning after lawyer <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>'s husband, requested the time to get a more experienced attorney. She was to be jailed overnight. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> had no comment to reporters Monday. `` She is unable to respond in her present state to questions addressed to her,'' <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> told acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, describing his wife as `` distraught.'' If convicted on an air piracy charge, she could be jailed for 20 years to life. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> has lived in the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area since 1983 and has had at least six different addresses, said <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>. Speaking to <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> said his wife had lived in the community for 10 years and was gainfully employed. But <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who has five children, did not have a job outside the home. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has 14 aliases listed for <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, according to an affadavit filed in support of a search warrant. Authorities have further established her identity through samples of her writing and telephone records of a phone call made to her grandfather, the Rev. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Staten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Girl's Brain Tumor Is Cancerous</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The brain tumor removed from a 2-year-old Ukrainian girl is cancerous, and her prognosis is guarded, doctors said Monday. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrievna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sverstiuk </PERSON> had the tumor removed from the base of her brain stem last Friday at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` The outlook for her future is guarded, depending on her response to therapy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>. `` While there's a high likelihood of the tumor recurring, we're hoping this new form of treatment can keep her in remission.'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sverstiuk </PERSON>, has said she believes the walnut-sized tumor resulted from radiation from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster, 50 miles from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> five days after the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire that killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of radioactive material. She was diagnosed as having a brain tumor two months ago. Doctors, however, say a solid tumor like <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s would have taken 10 to 20 years to develop if it were caused by radiation. `` She is recovering extremely well, considering the type of brain surgery she had,'' <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> said. Her mother has maintained a bedside vigil, reading stories and singing Ukrainian songs, according to the hospital. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> is to begin her radiation program and physical therapy later this week, the hospital said. The toddler's trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> followed efforts of Ukrainian communities on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and negotiations between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A body found near this coastal town was identified Monday as that of a 15-year-old girl whose disappearance nearly six weeks ago spurred a search of beaches and logging roads by hundreds of volunteers. Authorities used dental records to identify the remains of <PERSON> Dorene </PERSON> <PERSON> Raterman </PERSON>, said Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewman </PERSON>, state medical examiner in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dorene </PERSON> disappeared June 15 after leaving her parents a note saying she was taking a bicycle ride to <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, a half-mile from her family's home in <LOCATION> Gearhart </LOCATION>, on the northern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> coast, about 75 miles west of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Within days, state police determined she had been killed at the beach, and two men were arrested in connection with her death. Her body was found Sunday by motorcyclists riding in a brushy area about 16 miles east of <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>. An autopy was planned for Tuesday. The girl's disappearance and the arrests angered some of the 970 residents of <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON>. One of the suspects wore a bulletproof vest to a court appearance, and a judge held the other's arraignment secretly because he feared for the suspect's safety. Police got their first break in the case when a man reported seeing a girl on a bicycle and two men in a gold sports car near the beach the night she disappeared. The description of the car led them to <PERSON> Tiac </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, son of a former county sheriff. <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> admitted he and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, 25, both dishwashers at a nearby hotel, had driven to the beach that night in <LOCATION> Eastman </LOCATION>'s car to drink beer and talk, and saw the girl there, according to a court affidavit. The affidavit said <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> told police that <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> strangled the girl. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, who denies Eastman's allegation, was charged with kidnapping and murdering the girl. <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> was charged with hindering prosecution for allegedly driving <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> from the scene of the slaying.

 A judge Monday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to accept the challenge of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> club and settle the battle for the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup sailing trophy on the seas instead of in the courts. The ruling also cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> club to use its controversial two-hulled catamaran in defense of the title it reclaimed for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987. State trial court Justice <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> ordered the two clubs to begin racing Sept. 19 off the coast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. She also denied the request of an English yacht club to join the race, and rejected the New Zealanders' petition to hold the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> club in contempt of court. `` The vision that ... the donors sought to perpetuate over the years was that of an international race on a grand scale among boats on the seas, and not a land-bound battle among clever lawyers in the courthouse,'' <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, had asked the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> club to accept its challenge sooner than 1991 _ the next date under the traditional formula of racing every four years. Mercury Bay also asked to use boats about 90 feet at the water line instead of the customary 45 feet. The judge did not specifically rule on whether <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> could use its catamaran, but ordered both sides to proceed with the competition and bring any complaints to court when the race was over. `` The Cup has always involved sailing challenges between similar boats, but the judge has ordered us to sail, and we are ready to sail mismatch or not,'' said <PERSON> Mercury </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Debreceny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Debrency </PERSON>, reached in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` If it's a mismatch, it will destroy the future of the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Sail <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> group which is sponsoring the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> entry, called the decision a victory for the American defenders and said his group is ready to race. `` Let's get the boats in the water and sail,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. According to the judge, the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup 1887 Deed of Gift, which established the rules for the sailing competition, is not specific about many of the changes in yacht racing since the first <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup in 1851. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> held the Cup for more than 125 years until it lost in 1983 at <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes _ the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s entry _ recaptured it last year when it beat <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in the semifinals then beat the Austrlian yacht <PERSON> Kookaburra </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

The White House quickly denied the allegation. `` We were told that if the hostages were held, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be given recognition ... and the White House door would be open for us,'' said <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, identified as chief adviser to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in an interview published in the September issue of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is not true,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> declined to comment further. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who was also interviewed by the magazine, did not mention the alleged contact with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> staff member, but did say that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had been instrumental in winning the release of some hostages. `` We released the first hostages from the embassy,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` They were released according to my personal efforts.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he undertook the mission at the request of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s predecessor and 1980 campaign opponent, President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> `` There was a special and permanent contact between me and President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` I have written documents from President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> himself.'' <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said he met in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` closest friends'' during the 1980 presidential race. He identified the supporter as a major financial contributor to the campaign and a member of the campaign staff, but did not name the person. `` We have the proof if it is denied,'' <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>. `` And I personally assure you that if the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration denies what I have said, we will turn this evidence over to you.'' <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> associate `` asked that I contact the chairman and make the request.'' He said he was told `` they would deny it if it ever became public.'' Minutes after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, marked the end of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, the 52 Americans who had been held hostage in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days were flown to freedom. A spokeswoman for former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said that he was not available for comment but that he had been asked previously about reports that a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supporter had attempted to delay the hostages' release. `` We have reports similar ... but I never sought or received any confirmation of the allegations,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, who also serves as <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s interpreter, made the assertions during interviews of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, conducted by a <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> writer in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in April and May, said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> were paid for the interview, <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> said. He said he did not know if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was present when <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> made the allegation about a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ally.

 The nation is finally starting to consecrate a forgotten war which stirred neither patriotic fervor nor domestic protest, the brutal, anti-communist crusade in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> which killed 54,000 Americans and ended with an uneasy armistice 35 years ago Wednesday. World War II veterans returned home triumphantly to ticker-tape parades. Returning <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans often met hostility. Many of the 1.5 million men and women who served in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the 37 months of fighting simply came home. For years, images of their sacrifice have been summoned up only during broadcasts of MASH, the television comedy series. `` They went in quietly and went out quietly,'' says one of them, retired Army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F.C </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` They were welcomed back home with an attitude of indifference. There were no parades, but there were no put-downs either.'' Today, only 40 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public is old enough to recall the Korean War in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still maintains one full division on the demarcation line.'' But now, perhaps inspired by the belated recognition given <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, the dead and living from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are being honored with resolutions from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and space on the capital's National Mall for a multimillion-dollar memorial. This week, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> vets are gathered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a round of ceremonies which, though mostly low-key, amount to the most extensive array of commemorative events since the fighting stopped in 1953, according to <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>. The war began after the Soviet-trained North Korean army crossed the 38th Parallel into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on June 25, 1950. It ended in stalemate on July 27, 1953. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, writing in a recent edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, points out that the war was not popular among Americans and was the first in which <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> essentially declared the enemy's homeland off-limits to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighting forces. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> says that body counts became more important than real estate as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and Chinese units staged human-wave assaults that accounted for many of the 1.4 million dead or wounded communist troops. The war _ called a `` conflict'' and `` police action'' by the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> administration _ saw the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of helicopters to evacuate wounded, according to <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>. Fighting under a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> banner, 54,260 Americans died in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 33,643 of them in battle. In the nine years of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 58,149 Americans died, 47,396 in battle. On a day-to-day basis, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was far bloodier. The Pentagon says that 1,269 Americans are still listed as prisoners of war or missing in action from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. It has no specific numbers for GIs still missing from the Korean War, but it numbers the POWs at 389. It was n't until 1985 that <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> vets even had their own organization, founded by retired Army 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> of Half Moon, N.Y. The <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has grown from 39 charter members to more than 3,000 and is a central participant in this week's 35th anniversary ceremonies. <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> now is working out of a sparsely furnished office at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is spearheading the drive to build the memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said the push for the memorial began after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans began the offensive that culminated in the dedicated of their monument on the Mall in 1982. `` The <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> vets were saying, ` where's ours?''' he said. After several years of groundwork, organizing and lobbying, the <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> vets won permission from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> this year to erect a privately financed memorial on the Mall. The initial budget is $ 6 million, with veterans required to repay any seed money advanced from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. The location is still undecided, but the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monuments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is recommending a site near the Lincoln Memorial and across a reflecting pool from the Vietnam Memorial. Once the location is chosen, the board will hold a competition to select a design to reflect the board's concept that it `` must radiate a message that is at once inspirational in content and timeless in meaning ... unique in concept, designed for public use.'' <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> says that $ 2.2 million has been raised so far, with $ 1 million coming from <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of the Korean automaker, and nearly $ 300,000 coming from <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> dealers. Among some 3,500 contributors, the Disabled American Veterans have given $ 500,000, the VFW $ 250,000 and the Paralyzed Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> $ 100,000, according to <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, whose goal is `` to put up a good memorial on what I call everybody's front lawn.'' <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> says that a Korean War memorial is needed because `` in the long run, the nation owes some form of recognition to those who, without all the fanfare of a war to save the world, marched off quietly to fight for freedom for a people they never heard of because their country asked them to do so.''

 Deposed Haitian President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said Monday that Haitian military men who are known friends of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were involved in the coup that ended his nation's 4-month experiment in democracy. He told a news conference his policies were poorly understood by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the `` nationalist and progressive'' orientation of his government was misinterpreted. As a result, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stood by as the coup proceeded, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> on Friday from his exile home in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He is campaigning to gain world support for a democratic front of Haitian politicians aimed at restoring democracy to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` Finally I can say that various officials involved in the coup are known and perceived as friends of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said. He went on, `` I was recently informed by a high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official that in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> there was a lot of confusion and doubt regarding the orientation of our government, and that they were not convinced when we called it nationalist and progressive. `` It seems like another error of my government was to want to remove the Haitian police from the army and put ... -LRB- the police -RRB- under the Justice Ministry ... This was interpreted by some military officials, and by those who see through their eyes, as a weakening of the army.'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said that when he left <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> following the May 19 military coup, someone asked him if he had consulted with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before trying to remove Lt. Col. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, who removed <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> instead. `` Do n't you know that you ca n't change any army commander without first hearing the opinion of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Embassy?'' the person said, according to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> gave no details about the individual. The desposed leader called for the world's democracies to repudiate publicly <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s military regime. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said he will seek <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s support in meetings with President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> and others before returning to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Friday and will meet with other Haitian politicians this weekend in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> spent 1978-86 in exile in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> during the repressive <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> era in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, and developed close contacts with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> headed a three-man junta that took over the Haitian government in February 1986, when dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was elected last January in elections that many Haitians claimed were rigged by the army. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> placed <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> under house arrest after overriding <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s orders for changes in the army. Soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> freed him June 19 and <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> deposed <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who was put on a plane to neighboring <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> the following day.

<TEXT>
 Historian <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, whose book criticizing white supremacy in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> led to his dismissal from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missisippi </ORGANIZATION> faculty in the 1960s, died Monday at 81. Family members said <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>'s death was due to complications from emphysema. Silver came to Ole Miss in 1936 and left in 1965 at the request of the university's board of trustees following publication in 1964 of `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>: A Closed Society.'' The book explored the racial divisions in the state and sharply criticized its white political establishment. `` He was controversial from the day he was born,'' his wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, said Monday from her home in <LOCATION> Dunedin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` He liked nothing better than upsetting -LRB- former Gov. -RRB- <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> and people like that. `` We were big troublemakers. I think he did a lot of good,'' she said. Silver's other books include `` <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` A Life for the Confederacy,'' `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in the Confederacy'' and `` Running Scared: Silver in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' his account of his own experiences there. After leaving Ole Miss, he taught at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> and then at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION>, from which he retired in 1979. In 1984, <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> to be honored by Ole Miss. In an interview that same year, he said he held no hard feelings about the past. `` There were a bunch of dummies running things in the'60s, but there were some fine people, too,'' he said. `` I think <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has done well in the last 20 years.'' He was born in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y. He attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and received his doctorate in history from <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. Survivors include his wife, a son, and two daughters. No funeral service was planned.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday night he is optimistic a truce date in the Iran-Iraq war can be set within 10 days. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it would be out of all newly won Iranian territory by Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief spoke on `` The MacNeil @ Lehrer Newshour'' TV program after saying earlier that he scheduled separate talks for Wednesday with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to pave the way for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire in their 8-year-old war. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> reported Monday that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> call to contribute military officers to monitor such a truce. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said about 250 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce observers from throughout the world will be sent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> once a cease-fire was declared, but gave no specifics. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> asked to meet this week to discuss a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and formal peace negotiations. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had sought face-to-face talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday he would not impose direct talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but hoped both sides would agree to such negotiations later. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> was expected at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Tuesday. Appearing on the same broadcast as Perez de Cuellar were the Iraqi <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>; the Iranian envoy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'Afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said that by Monday midnight, `` all Iraqi forces will have completed their withdrawal to our side of the internationally recognized border. ... We have no intention of occupying and holding Iranian territory for bargaining.'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` is ready to immediately observe a cease-fire'' and that he does not object to direct talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He again charged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in its latest military offensive and <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> refused to deny it. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he viewed <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>'s announcement about withdrawing from Iranian territory as a `` positive sign.'' `` I think they -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> -RRB- both made a decision to go for peace,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy said. `` Eight yars is a long time, you get weary.'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he was optimistic peace would result. The Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980. `` I'm an old soldier. I know what war involves. I have seen the bodies being put into body bags and that's when you really know what war is about. And there have been almost a million bodies put into body bags -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war -RRB- and that has an impact on nations,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. `` It's their coming generation that they're going to be losing and I think that's why they have both come to the conclusion that this is the time to stop.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said peace efforts could be jeopardized by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s latest offensive, intended to strengthen its position at the bargaining table <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday and the Iranian Mission said he would meet Tuesday with the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, Paulo Nogueira-Batista of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said last week that `` the Iranians are not yet prepared to have direct talks,'' so he would conduct shuttle diplomacy, meeting each delegation separately as they go to his 38th-floor office. The new impetus to the peace process came July 18 when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> suddenly announced it would accept <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, which demands an immediate cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had resisted for one year. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which accepted the resolution a year ago, abruptly called for immediate, face-to-face talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before a truce goes into effect. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials meanwhile warned that plans for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce supervision could be jeopardized by the world body's financial crisis, largely caused by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrears of $ 467 million _ two-thirds of the total <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> debt. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been withholding its legal <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contribution for years to compel the organization to institute reforms. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> technical team of military experts was bound for <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to start working out details of a truce. It later will visit <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. A separate team arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to look into the prisoners of war situation and later will visit <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to talk with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but said he knew of no contacts planned with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> held closed-door consultations Monday on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s protest against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s latest alleged use of chemical weapons. It adjourned without taking action.

<HEAD>Oil Rig Explosion Cuts Into Britain's Balance Of Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The offshore oil platform explosion that killed 167 people will cost <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> more than $ 500 million in lost energy sales, the government announced Monday. In <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, police said the body of one more worker had been pulled from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Monday, bringing the total bodies recovered to 42. Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that the fiery blast that tore apart the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> oil rig June 6 also knocked five related platforms out of production. The shutdown of all six <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> platforms cut <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s oil production 12 percent and natural gas production 1 percent, <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said. He said the five associated platforms could be back in service in a few months, but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was not producing 180,000 barrels of oil per day as the rigs stood idle. He estimated the cost in lost energy sales at $ 516 million. <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION>, 120 miles off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s eastern coast, produced 120,000 to 130,000 barrels a day before it exploded in the worst disaster in oilfield history. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> told the 650-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> that the government would accept any safety recommendations stemming from investigations into the tragedy. The Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is the operator and main owner of the platform, said four workers remain hospitalized. The company said 125 men are still missing. Winds gusting to more that 40 mph Monday prevented <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> troubleshooter <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> and his oil-fire experts from boarding the stricken platform. They were still trying to tame two burning wellheads. Fires at two other wells are being controlled by injecting sea water to dampen the flames, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said, and three other wells have been plugged with cement.

<HEAD>Negotiators Start Another Round of Bases Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Greek and American negotiators started another round of talks Monday for a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases agreement, just 12 days after the socialist government announced it was ending the current accord. Government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> stressed that `` we're not negotiating an extension of the existing agreement, but a new one. He also repeated Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s pledge that a new agreement must be approved by a referendum before it can take effect. The current five-year agreement expires in December this year. On July 13, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> formally notified the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in writing that the 1983 pact was ending and that the bases should be dismantled by 1990. Western diplomats said the notification is considered a formality that will not affect this week's talks. Negotiations have been slowed by <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' insistence that a new accord should express support for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in its dispute with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> region. The American position is that an agreement on military bases should not be broadened to include political backing for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1981 on a platform that called for closure of the four main <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bases and 20 smaller installations, but later modified its positions. The party indicated in a document published last week that the bases may be allowed to stay. It said the party maintains a long-term goal of shutting down the bases, but `` with a decisive contribution to our national defense, a continuation of defense cooperation is possible.'' <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> receives $ 343 million yearly in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military credits as a form of rent for the bases. About 3,500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen are stationed in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, mostly at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> support base next to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport and at another <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> facility on the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>.

 Hundreds of people were evacuated from lower floors of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s tallest building Monday when an electrical fire filled two floors and the atrium area with smoke, officials said. The fire was quickly doused. There were no injuries in the blaze in the 76-story <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Fire Department Lt. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said the fire was reported about 12:15 p.m. and controlled 10 minutes later. Firefighters helped put out the blaze, but sprinklers did most of the work, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON>. A lack of sprinklers was cited as a factor in a fatal fire May 4 in another <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> skyscraper, the 62-story <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. One person died and 40 were injured in that blaze. <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> said Monday's fire was believed to have been started by an electrical short. Damage had n't been estimated yet, but would be substantial, <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> said. There was extensive damage to wiring between the third and fourth floors as well as smoke damage, he said.

 A fiery explosion at a chemical plant early Monday critically injured two employees and forced about 300 people from their homes during the night, authorities said. Houses near the <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> were evacuated for about two hours when thick black fumes drifted through the area, police said. `` We heard the explosion and jumped out of bed like a spring,'' said <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robish </PERSON>, who lives two blocks from the plant. Authorities had not determined if the fumes were toxic. `` I just got done reading and was getting ready for bed when I heard this very loud boom,'' said <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyrda </PERSON>, another nearby resident. She said police asked residents to leave their homes about an hour after the 1 a.m. explosion. Mrs. <PERSON> Dyrda </PERSON> said she grabbed her 3-year-old son, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>, and headed for a nearby community center set up for the evacuees. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> were at the scene, about 13 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, trying to determine the cause of the blaze, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Corkery </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The polymer manufacturing plant makes latex, an adhesive that binds materials in paint together.

Two employees were in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Geeting </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Monday it will withdraw from Iranian territory captured in the past week, prompting hopes of quiet on the long border warfront when peace talks begin at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Announcers interrupted regular state television programs to say the army would withdraw on Tuesday from territory captured in the central border region. `` They will be withdrawn in line with our declared policy that we have no territorial ambitions in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' said a military communique read by the announcers. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday night he is optimistic a truce date in the Iran-Iraq war can be set within 10 days. The war began in September 1980. Appearing on the `` The MacNeil @ Lehrer Newshour'' TV program with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief were <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'Afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> announced that by midnight Monday <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> time, `` all Iraqi forces will have completed their withdrawal to our side of the internationally recognized border. ... We have no intention of occupying and holding Iranian territory for bargaining.'' He refused to deny a complaint by <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in its latest military offensive. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` is ready to immediately observe a cease-fire'' and that he does not object to direct talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> commented: `` I think they -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> -RRB- both made a decision to go for peace. Eight years is a long time, you get weary.'' At <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Monday, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> began private consultations on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s complaint that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in a weekend offensive in violation of the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention. Perez de Cuellar scheduled separate meetings for Wednesday with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, in an attempt to reach a truce. `` I plan to begin to talking to each separately and I hope this might lead to direct talks,'' he said as he entered <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Monday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s withdrawal announcement came after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its military units attacked <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces in southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> early Monday, forcing them to retreat 25 miles and killing or wounding 1,500 men. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, claimed an Iraqi jet fighter was shot down over the border town <LOCATION> Sar-i </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zhaab </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its aircraft flew 261 sorties and all returned safely. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it had withdrawn from territory seized in a drive last week toward <LOCATION> Ahwaz </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Both offensives occurred after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced acceptance of a year-old <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> truce resolution, and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of trying to sabotage peace efforts. Diplomats and officials in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> described the attacks as an attempt to strengthen <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s hand in peace talks. Monday's communique said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has `` taught the Iranian regime a lesson. We will wait to see how they will react vis-a-vis peace and direct negotiations.'' The <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> communique identified towns being evacuated as Qasr-e <PERSON> Shirin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gharb </PERSON>, <PERSON> Soummar </PERSON> and Sar-i Pol Zhaab, and said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers also would leave the villages of <LOCATION> Sale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abad </LOCATION>, Mir <PERSON> Abad </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION>. It indicated the Iraqis were leaving willingly, not because of Iranian military pressure. `` Now that our forces achieved their targets and liberated our national territories, our political command has issued orders that our withdrawal will start as of Tuesday, July 26, from all cities and places we occupied inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the communique said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed the Iraqis were driven out. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, interrupted regular programs to say Iranian soldiers `` succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy'' and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> bodies dotted the battlefield. It broadcast martial music, along with praise for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s soldiers and exhortations for civilians to volunteer Neither side's claims could be confirmed independently. Foreign journalists and observers are allowed into war zones only on rare guided tours. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> received visitors on Monday who chanted `` Please God keep <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> alive!'' and `` We are all your soldiers! We will obey your orders!'' and the 87-year-old revolutionary leader responded by waving his hand, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. Resolution 598, which the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed unanimously July 20, 1987, provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation of which side started the war.

<HEAD>Hungary To Open Limited Stock Exchange Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The communist government will open a limited stock exchange in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Jan. 1 with members only permitted to buy and sell shares, according to the head of the securities trade secretariat. <PERSON> Ilona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, in an interview with the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> published Monday, said financial institutions that conduct weekly `` dealers days'' that were introduced earlier this year would discuss the establishment of a self-governing council and an ethics committee at a meeting Tuesday. Establishment of a stock exchange even with a severe restriction on membership is a significant break from the anti-capitalist economics followed by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and other eastern European nations following Soviet domination at the end of World War II. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> was quoted as saying the creation of a closed joint-stock company could be followed by the transformation of other companies into joint-stock firms with the stock exchange establishing their value. The planned stock exchange is to open at the same time that a new law on companies goes into effect. Government officials have said the law, now in the drafting stage, will be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in the fall. It is to put state, cooperative and private enterprise firms on an equal footing and limit state monopolies in some areas. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said about half of the securities issued in the first six months of this year, valued at the equivalent of $ 74 million, have been sold on secondary markets. According to the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency, which carried excerpts of the interview, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the bond rate has dropped to between 90 and 93 percent, leading issuers to offer bonuses worth between 1 and 3 percent in an effort to create a higher demand. On July 1, interest rates on private deposits rose by an average 4 percent, making bonds issued last year with a fixed interest less attractive, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Dozens of people gathered on a mountaintop in central Puerto Rico Monday for a quiet ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the police killing of two young supporters of independence for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Two other commemorative dates fell on Monday _ the 36th anniversary of the signing of the constitution that established <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> as a semi-autonomous U.. <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, and the 90th anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military occupation of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in 1898 Young girls laid flowers and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> flags on the spot where <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrivi </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosado </PERSON>, 24, were shot on July 25, 1978, and speakers demanded that those responsible for the deaths be brought to justice. `` We're here to demand that the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government fulfill its promises to jail those officials of -LRB- former Gov. -RRB- <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcelo </PERSON>'s government who covered up these murders,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallisa </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcelo </PERSON> of the pro-statehood <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was governor at the time of the killings. The Popular Democrats are now in control. About 70 miles away, in the capital city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, an estimated 50,000 people gathered in front of the seaside capitol building for speeches, singing and dancing to mark the constitution's 36th anniversary. A jubilant Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, who is seeking re-election in November, spoke for 30 minutes about his administration's achievements. Then he rolled up his shirt-sleeves and leaped off the 12-foot-high stage into the waiting arms of supporters and circulated through the crowd pressed around him. Four <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jets roared overhead in formation as dozens of people stood on a hill across from the capitol, holding up red, white and blue placards to form a Puerto Rican flag. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ceded <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1898 after the Spanish American War. Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens with most of the rights of their mainland counterparts except that in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> they can not vote for president. Most islanders are divided between supporting the current commonwealth status or statehood. About 5 percent voted in the last election for the party that supports independence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosado </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrivi </PERSON> were killed in a police ambush when they went up to a remote mountain called <ORGANIZATION> Cerro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maravilla </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Marvel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, purportedly to gain publicity for independence by blowing up a transmitter. They were led there by a police informant, who has since been assassinated by an underground group that said it was avenging the two deaths. Police first said they killed the two in an exchange of gunfire, but a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigation later revealed that <PERSON> Rosado </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrivi </PERSON> were shot at close range while on their knees after having surrendered. Six policemen are serving long prison sentences for murder in the killings and eight officers in all have been convicted of perjury for lying to two federal grand juries. The killings are still under investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a specially appointed independent prosecutor are trying to find out if government officials were involved in the cover-up.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after outlining a $ 2.2 billion child-care program designed to help close his gender gap with women, is turning his attention to selecting a running mate. The vice president says he expects to have `` some kind of a list'' of potential running mates prepared by sometime this week, although he hopes to delay announcing his choice until the GOP convention next month. The certain Republican presidential candidate was expected to spend much of this week mulling over his vice presidential selection and had few campaign events scheduled. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was drawing mixed reviews for his proposal for child-care tax credits of up to $ 1,000 per child for low-income families. For the neediest families _ those earning less than $ 10,000 a year _ the `` credit'' would become a direct government payment of the maximum $ 1,000 for each child of four or younger. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the proposal Sunday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> and Professional Women's Clubs in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, ending a five-day burst of campaigning in seven states.

 The drought that has forced Okefenokee Swamp's wildlife to gather near deeper pools and its alligators to engage in cannibalism, is necessary for the survival of the swamp, a parks official says. `` The swamp has tolerated drought for thousands of years.

Swamp vegetation dries out during a drought, increasing the chance of wildfire ignited by lightning. But, <PERSON> Schroer </PERSON> said, wildfires are necessary because they burn off floating islands of peat, which eventually can turn into dry land. Indians dubbed the swamp `` the land of the trembling earth'' because of the undulating peat.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Army Leader Says Key to War is Winning over the Poor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN MIGUEL, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, a combat-tempered colonel who is a front-runner to be armed forces commander, says the military's chief aim in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war should be winning the loyalty of the rural poor, not killing guerrillas. He said in an interview at his 3rd Brigade headquarters in this provincial capital 85 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that soldiers should help improve living standards for the rural poor, campesinos as they are called. `` Build a coop and set up a chicken-raising enterprise, teach them how to plant vegetables, the raising of pigs,'' he said. `` These are cheap projects, more immediate. The people see problems resolved more quickly, and it leaves them with a tool they can use for life.'' <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION>, 41, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, added that he has set aside some of his troops for that purpose and indicated he believed similar efforts should be made all around the countryside by the military. High-ranking military sources say he is the most likely officer to succeed Gen. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> as chief of the joint chiefs of staff when <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> retires in the coming months. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said he uses two kinds of military units in his command. `` One is eminently operative, for carrying out offensive military operations that principally strike -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- commanders at different levels. These are units trained for night operations, ambushes and long-range patrols. The other type of unit carries out first a military role but then fulfills a political function,'' he explained. `` We can not think that solely by military means we are going to resolve this war. Even if we kill all the subversives, the problem will not end. Such deplorable socio-economic conditions would remain that it -LRB- the insurgency -RRB- could easily revive. `` This is an ideological and psychological war, a war for the masses and a war of oganization.'' Of the political work, he added, `` you always have to give the campesinos something concrete, because they ca n't eat words.'' Referring to two previous, and unsuccessful, development projects designed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers to win over the populace, he said: `` It's no longer a matter of building schools or paving roads. What we're doing requires less sophistication and less bureaucracy.'' <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said his strategy is producing positive results in his eastern command zone. But two commanders of the guerrillas' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, contended in interviews broadcast by the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos that an army that represents <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s status quo can never win the poor farmer's heart. Commander <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> said the fact that rebel forces are still active in all of the country's 14 provinces, although outnumbered 8-1 by government troops, means the army `` has failed militarily.'' `` The root of this failure is in the nature of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, which arises precisely from those same popular sectors,'' he said. Rebel commander <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> said in a separate interview in June: `` The objectives in the mind of each combatant have to be expressions of the true interests of his people ... and that's why neither -LRB- Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> nor the Americans could ever convert -LRB- the rural poor -RRB- to the cause of foreign interests that have nothing to do with our particular problems.'' The rural poor make up 60 percent of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s population of 5.1 million. Four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> experts who studied <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> also see the key to the war as lying with the loyalty of the rural poor. Cols. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallums </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, A.J. <PERSON> Bacevich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> addressed the subject in a paper they wrote in March at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, titled `` American Military Policy in Small Wars: The Case of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' Of the campaign for the allegiance of the populace, the officers concluded that `` disappointment with the outcome -LRB- of previous efforts -RRB- convinced hard-core Salvadoran commanders to forget about ` hearts and minds' in favor of pursuing guerrillas.'' Of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role, the paper says: `` Despite their appreciation that winning popular support remains as the ultimate strategic aim in counterinsurgency, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials have yet to devise adequate mechanisms to achieve that aim.''

<HEAD>Venice Preparing to Test System to Protect It from Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the sirroco blows up the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> from the deserts of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s lagoon swells up and spills into the city. Sirens sound a mournful reminder: <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> is losing its struggle with the environment. Even at the height of summer, gondoliers ply their trade over murky green and often foul-smelling canals alive with algae thriving on tons of raw sewage. But a group of scientists and engineers are finally preparing to test the prototype of a system to protect <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> from the sea that once protected it. After nearly four years of work and $ 700 million in costs, the engineers in the fall will install at the <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION> entrance to the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> lagoon the prototype of a mobile dike designed to stem the flood tides that have troubled the city's past and threaten its future. `` The goal of the project is to save <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, to save the life of the lagoon, to save the port, to save the historic city and the economic life of its people,'' said <PERSON> Maurio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON>, director of public relations for the Venezia Nuova -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> -RRB- consortium. He said the consortium of 26 Italian companies is executing the 10-year, $ 4.4 billion-project to build a line of mobile dikes across the lagoon's three entrances, shore up the sea walls and islands, preserve the canals and restore the ecological balance in the polluted lagoon. Venetians built their island city along 150 winding canals to protect themselves from invaders. Now the threat comes from the sea that once guarded them. High tides flood the city about 100 times a year, corroding magnificent churches, monuments and the marble walls of elegant villas. The consortium intends to stem the tides with the mobile dikes strung across the bottom of the lagoon entrances. During flood tides, <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> said, engineers will raise the dikes, effectively sealing the lagoon. Ships will be able to sail in and out through a series of locks at the entrances. `` With the mobile system we will be able to decide at what point and at what time we want to intervene,'' said <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON>. Flood tides are triggered by differences in atmospheric pressure at either end of the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> or by the sirocco wind blowing across the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and up the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION>, driving the sea water northward toward <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. Great flood tides were heavily destructive to <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> in 789, in 1268 and in 1280. In 1410, they killed close to 1,000 people. In this century, the worst floods came in 1916, 1936, 1951 and in 1966, when high water caused an estimated $ 85 million damage. Venetians have struggled for centuries to protect the city from its surroundings. These efforts have included building sea walls to guard the littoral islands and several anti-silting projects. More recently they succeeded in stopping <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> from sinking, after it had settled 4 -LCB- inches from 1926 to 1970, by banning industrial use of underground water. Critics say the government and the new consortium have reacted slowly to <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s problems, that the city has been drowning in a sea of bureacracy and empty talk. The consortium's <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> responds that the law creating the project requires that all the work be `` experimentally tested, reversible if necessary and done in stages.'' Scientists used satellite analysis and computer models to study how their work will effect the problems of stagnation and erosion. Scale models of the entire lagoon and the three entrances were built at <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s hydraulic experimental center in nearby <LOCATION> Padua </LOCATION>. In September, workers will install the prototype of one of the 56-foot-high, 66-foot-long mobile dikes for six to eight months of tests. <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> said the consortium will be ready to put the entire line of dikes in place by 1992. He added that the tests indicate that engineers will be able to help wash pollutants out of the lagoon. As part of the project, the government is also supposed to enact laws restricting the dumping of industrial pollutants and the use of agricultural pesticides that seep into the lagoon.

<TEXT>
 Coppersmiths and carpenters still clatter today at their ancient crafts along the `` Street called Straight,'' where the Bible says <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was cured of blindness. Venders peddle vials of perfume beneath Roman columns near the great 8th century Omayyed mosque. Stalls in the narrow market streets still dazzle with spices, silver and silk in the city that <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON>, scourge of the Crusaders, called home. Some of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>'s old city survives, but it is in danger of being swallowed by the sprawl of modern <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't imagine how important <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> is, and how rich,'' said <PERSON> Afif </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahnassi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Director of Antiquities. He's one of about a dozen officials and experts named this year to a committee charged with saving the flavor and heritage of this ancient city, termed `` the Paradise of the Orient'' by the 12th century Spanish traveller <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jubayer </PERSON>. Busy streets now flank the old Roman walls, and mud-sided 19th century neighborhoods nearby have fallen to highways and modern housing needed for a growing metropolis of 3 million people. Even within the old walled city, `` we're afraid ... there's now some opinion to remove the old houses,'' <PERSON> Bahnassi </PERSON> said in an interview. The committee has set conditions on development and is working to restore old neighborhoods. <PERSON> Bahnassi </PERSON> said it has asked owners to restore their own buildings, and offers financial assistance for those who need help. But he said it is difficult to find craftsmen skilled in the old buildings' styles. `` We'd like to encourage the workers to be more interested in the old systems,'' he said. Damascenes often refer to their city as the oldest still inhabited, but its age is uncertain. Settlements excavated nearby date to about 10,000 B.C. <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> itself is referred to in Egyptian and other documents dating back about 4,000 years, <PERSON> Bahnassi </PERSON> said. Arameans who migrated to the city from the deserts built a temple to the god <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON> in about 1,000 B.C. The Romans used the same site for their temple to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. Early Christians built a cathedral on the Roman foundations, and elements of both remain in in the richly decorated Omayyed mosque, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest surviving monumental mosque. Among its shrines is one holding the head of <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Baptist, revered by Moslems as well as Christians. According to Acts 9 in the New Testament, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, then <PERSON> Saul </PERSON>, was stricken blind as he made his way to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to persecute the followers of Christ. He was taken to a house on the `` Street called Straight,'' the account goes on. It says <PERSON> Ananias </PERSON>, a follower of Christ, was instructed by a voice from Heaven to find <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> there and cure him of his blindness. Nearly all the great empires of Middle Eastern history fought over and conquered <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, whose oasis straddles three enduring trade routes connecting <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mesopotamia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Early Islamic authorities referred to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>' oasis as the site of the Garden of Eden. `` The Gardens encircle it like the halo round the moon,'' <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jubayer </PERSON> wrote in the 12th century. Some say <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> slew <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> on the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kassioun </LOCATION> on the city's Western edge, and placed <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s birthplace there. At the height of its glory under the Islamic Omayyed dynasty, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> was the capital of an Arab empire that reached from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to the edges of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Yet despite its many wars, `` nobody in its history destroyed it completely,'' said <PERSON> Harb </PERSON> <PERSON> Farzat </PERSON>, an historian at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Damascus </ORGANIZATION>. The crowded streets and bazaars of the old city still conjure images of medieval times. Upper stories project over the narrow lanes, often nearly touching. Crumbling walls on some reveal the mud, wattle and wood construction <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jubayer </PERSON> noted in 1184, when <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON> used the city as his capital during his successful campaign against the Crusaders of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Ornate stone doorways open onto the luxurious marble floors and fountains of restored Turkish baths, some dating to the 13th century and still in use. Coffee houses hundreds of years old still serve thick, heavily sugared Turkish coffee to men in Arab garb who puff at waterpipes over games of backgammon. But <PERSON> Farzat </PERSON>, who was born in the city, said: `` When you've seen <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> a generation before, you can see how it has changed.'' From a high-rise hotel window, he pointed at the sprawl of concrete now covering the ghouta, the oasis gardens that led many ancient authors to liken <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to paradise. The greatest loss, he said, was `` to destroy the ghouta, the Paradise of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Now it's covered with buildings.''

<TEXT>
 A sea of faded-green tents has become home for 165,000 refugees _ mostly women, children and old men _ of a stalemated war in the desert of nearby <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. Four-color flags of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic flutter in the hot wind, over banners and grafitti proclaiming the republic's slogan: `` The Entire Homeland or Martyrdom.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and international relief organizations have been feeding and housing the refugees for more than a decade. The refugees wait here in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for something to happen in the war between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Marxist-led Polisario guerrilla movement for control of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. The Algeria-backed Polisario movement set up the <LOCATION> Sahrawi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION> in 1976 after <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> turned <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> _ the latter has since withdrawn. Although the Sahrawi republic won diplomatic recognition from more than 70 countries, mostly in the Third World, it has been unable to gain a permanent foothold in the mineral-rich territory. The war has reached a stalemate and the guerrillas now talk of a compromise settlement, but prospects seem distant and sporadic fighting continues. Polisario officials contend the refugees in camps near this Algerian oasis represent virtually the entire population of the disputed territory. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> held the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> until 1975, mainly to protect the nearby <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Little effort was made to develop the wilderness, an area about the size of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Spanish colonial records indicate the territory had a population of only 75,000 when <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> pulled out. At least 50,000 now live under Moroccan rule, frequently proclaiming their loyalty to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> maintains that more than three-fourths of the Tindouf refugees are not from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> but from neighboring <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and other impoverished countries on the fringes of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. Arabic-speaking Moslems, they originally were nomads, herding goats and camels over unmarked boundaries, often not even aware which country they were in. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, a high-school pupil studying in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, spoke of the culture shock he experiences in traveling between the dual worlds of modern <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and his family tent near <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>. `` I live in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> nine months of the year and I hate it and long for my family,'' he said, sitting recently in the brightly decorated tent beside his younger sister, <PERSON> Habiba </PERSON>. `` Then when I come here for the three months of the summer, I'm dying to return.'' He shares his perplexity with hundreds of young people who travel to universities in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Polisario officials have set up a system to prevent loss of a national and cultural identity among the young and to reinforce their motivation to fight. `` The young teach the old how to read and write,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, a school teacher. `` The old teach them history and tradition so as to enforce their sense of identity.'' From age 9, the children also receive basic military training in preparation for automatic conscription after high school of boys who do n't go on to university. <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>, a military zone, is 1,000 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. The refugee camps begin about two miles west of <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>, their rows of canvas tents and adjacent stone kitchens spread in clusters over the stark landscape. At a camp hospital, Dr. <PERSON> Khadigetto </PERSON> <PERSON> Alawi </PERSON> said she had just returned from five years of medical training in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. She said she and the other hospital staff receive no salaries. Polisario officials said no one receives any pay, including the 16,000-man guerrilla army and 70,000 officials. A few raise goats and sheep for their own use, they said. A woman who identified herself as <PERSON> Humayed </PERSON> welcomed a group of visiting reporters into the tent she shares with six women and children of her family. She said their menfolk were `` at the front'' 120 miles away. `` The women have an important role while the men are away at war,'' said a Roman Catholic priest who goes by the name <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and works for the <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION> relief organization. `` They marry young, so as to have many children. And they also undergo military training themselves. We try to teach them the importance of mother-child care. They concentrate a lot on preventive medicine.'' A Polisario official said it is expected that young war widows remarry quickly in order to maintain population growth. Ghalouha el-Salm, a war widow-bride, said she has spent the nine years since she lost her husband rearing a daughter but now is marrying again. `` I have to continue having children,'' she said, explaining that it was a `` national'' requirement. Most of the women said they long to return to the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and its cool <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> breezes when the war is over.

<TEXT>
 Harassed by crop burnings, air surveillance and cratering by police of illegal landing strips, drug barons have begun to smuggle marijuana out of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> in shipments of pumpkins, books and flip-flop sandals. Business leaders say the traffic threatens <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s entire export industry, which along with tourism is the economy's most vibrant. Thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in precious foreign earnings are at stake. `` The problem is critical,'' said <PERSON> Lascelles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Henkel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION>. `` If this is not curtailed, we are all in for a tough time.'' Shippers say with the tough government measures against trafficking, drug barons now are managing to slip marijuana, or ganja as it is called here, into legal cargoes. Some have been detected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents and the shipping companies, even though they be be unaware of the shipments, face heavy fines. Many have become reluctant to handle Jamaican exports. In February, for example, a <ORGANIZATION> Kirk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> ship, the Mercandian Supplier, was found to be carrying 13,000 pounds of marijuana in its cargo of crackers bound for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> fined the company $ 103 million. The biggest cargo carrier to serve this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation, Evergreen Shipping of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, decided in June it will deliver but no longer accept containers in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> found marijuana hidden aboard them in late 1986. The company is negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> on the amount of fines to be imposed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs ordinarily imposes fines at the rate of $ 500 an ounce of marijuana found, but it offers companies the opportunity to present mitigating evidence in an effort to lower those set amounts. Four Air <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> planes have been seized in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after contraband drugs were found aboard. Exports are vital to this poor island nation of 2.4 million people, where one of every four members of the work force is unemployed. As world markets and prices collapsed in the 1980s for <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s traditional products _ bauxite -LRB- from which aluminum is made -RRB-, sugar and bananas _ other exports have picked up the slack About 29,000 jobs were created in factories making dresses, pants and other clothes for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. Last year, exports raised more than $ 700 million in foreign exchange, which <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> needs to buy oil, machinery, spare parts and food. The exporters' response to the ganja barons has been to screen employees, implement tamper-resistant packaging, and monitor production and delivery closely. `` I schedule it so my truck arrives at the dock as soon as the gangplank is dropped,'' said <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, explaining that it lessens the chances for marijuana to be hidden in his shipments of fruits and vegetables. `` I give drivers cases of cold drinks and a can opener so they do n't have to stop on the way, and just hope they do n't get a puncture -LRB- flat tire -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> added, however, that he has reduced his shipments because the produce was spoiling on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> docks while awaiting clearance by inspectors searching for drugs. But as one ruse is uncovered, another develops. `` Now we're finding marijuana in false bulkheads and false roofs'' in the steel and fiberglass containers into which merchandise is loaded, said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've never had this problem as much as during the past six to eight weeks.'' Laborers from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> introduced ganja to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> in the mid-19th century. The subtropical climate is ideal for its cultivation; the fastest growing varieties can be harvested every three months. Although cultivation and use of marijuana became common in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, it posed few problems until traffickers started exporting it. In the 1970s, cocaine smuggling increased as aircraft stopped over for refueling en route from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s two main political parties have condemned drug trafficking and taken steps to halt it. In the 1970s, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government of socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> ordered illegal airstrips spiked, encouraged farmers to grow legal crops, and seized contraband planes. The current prime minster, conservative <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which came to power in 1980, has imposed stiff sanctions on traffickers, and threatened to shoot down drug planes. Thousands of acres of marijuana fields have been cut down, and hundreds of tons of marijuana have been burned. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding, particularly for the Operation Buccaneer crop eradication program, increased to $ 3.4 million last year from $ 49,000 in 1984. Now farmers, for whom ganja is their most marketable crop, plant it on smaller patches in remote valleys and hillsides. They also are experimenting with faster growing varieties, neglecting traditional crops. Cocaine use, meanwhile, appears to be increasing among <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s upper and middle classes, and trafficking is feared to be stimulating crime and corruption Jamaican officials say they are grappling with the problem as best they can. But they bristle at statements by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and at news accounts that they maintain cast <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> in a bad light. They cite as one example the allegation that political parties accept contributions from drug barons. `` It is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who are creating the demand for drugs, subsidizing the planting of ganja in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and organizing and managing the transporting of ganja from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>,'' Minister of Public Works <PERSON> Pearnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a recent interview with The Daily Gleaner of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>. In April, Prime Minster <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> lodged a formal protest with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after he was linked in closed-door testimony by a convicted drug trafficker before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with accepting payoffs. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> responded that the charges were unsubstantiated.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's crackdown on drug trafficking is upsetting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. They complain the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is maligning their leaders and encroaching on their sovereignty. `` It's just unsettling to people to hear that their leaders have been charged in a court in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when anyone who knows anything about justice knows these cases will never come up for a hearing,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>. `` It's not only wrong, its incomprehensible.'' The issue came up at a recent meeting of the leaders of 13 former and current <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> colonies in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, in <LOCATION> Antigua-Barbuda </LOCATION>. The young parliamentary democracies, most of which gained independence over the past 25 years, drafted a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug policy in the region. The contents of the letter were not disclosed, but it was believed to have focused on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigations of government leaders in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, as well as Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the Panamanian strongman. Sir <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, prime minister of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, is under investigation by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand jury for alleged drug-related offenses. He has denied any connection with the drug trade. At the <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION> summit, <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> assailed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for what he called its `` ideologically motivated, interventionist'' policies. In March, Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly conspiring to import cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, a key figure in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s army, denied any involvement. In May, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee heard testimony by a convicted drug trafficker that linked Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> with payoffs. An incensed <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, whose marijuana eradication program is the most comprehensive in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s history, filed a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which later said the testimony was unsubstantiated and baseless. `` People are concerned with the reputation of individuals,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>. `` I'm referring to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> witnesses that are free to commit libel ... and those people who are libeled have no protection or recourse.'' Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of exporting its battle against drugs to win votes for Republicans in November. `` The domestic imperatives of an election year in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have forced certain people ... to step beyond what is acceptable in terms of ... the sovereignty of a country,'' he said. Prime Minister A.N.R. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Trinidad-Tabago </PERSON> suggested that countries work out ways to bring offenders to justice and ensure that `` individuals are not just slandered and characters assassinated ... or that countries should use the judicial process for political ends.''

 Like good comedians, certain investment analysts never run out of material. As one respected member of that fraternity observed earlier this month, they followed the monetarists in the early 1980s, switched to oil-watching in 1985 and jumped to commodities last year. `` And now _ drumroll please _ it is the meteorologists,'' observes <PERSON> Lucinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mezy </PERSON>, director of equity research <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a bank-holding company based in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The drought, that is, has developed brand new commentaries on where the economy is headed. Billions of words have come from brokerage houses on what the drought means for food prices, and therefore for stocks. The political activities of 1988 provide myriad variations for commentaries on interest rates, inflation, stock prices and investor confidence. Each poll, whether or not it shows changes, is reason again for further commentary. The Iran-Iraq affair already has been worked into forecasts by analysts who could not think of anything more to say about <PERSON> Nicarauga </PERSON> and the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and by bulls who had run out of things to say about glasnost. Fallback resources include the emergence of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as an industrial power, the amount of money in circulation, the budget and trade deficits, the dollar, the possibility of inflation or higher interest rates and Third World debt. Increasingly, analysts analyze analysts, producing one of the oddest of all analyses, one that states the stock market is about to rise when the majority of analysts are bearish, and is set to fall when they turn bullish. There is an open pit mine, ready to be worked at any time, in analyzing the disposition of investors. Do they have confidence? Do they have money? Will they buy cars and appliances? Will they save? Will they buy junk bonds? Government provides enough material, often in controversial form, to keep armies of analysts computing and dissecting. Lists of upcoming government economic announcements has become a regular feature of brokers' letters. A rise or fall in housing starts is good for hundreds of words on the consequences to securities. Inflation and interest rates, jobless statistics, factory capacity, imports, exports, debt, deficits all go into the mix. Still, without these events, institutions and subjects there would hardly be a drought of material on which to comment. Always, there is the mine of statistical material that can be dug up and massaged by computer. That resource was well used and thoroughly abused in the weeks and months immediately following the securities crash of last October, the most common of the analyses producing statistics likening it to the Great Crash of 1929. It mattered little that events failed to prove that 1987 was 1929 all over again; it simply provided more material for analysis on why the two years differed. In themselves, differences of opinion are fodder for analysis. How all this helps investors is difficult to perceive, but it is easy enough to see how it helps those who sell securities. It keeps customers talking. It maintains interest. It provides material for sales calls. But almost if not utterly lost in the mountain of commentary is the matter of accuracy. It is then that the words are seen for what they are worth. In investing, those words just do not add up. Only the numbers do.

 Before <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> goes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in September to receive a prize for courageous reporting she'll have to get permission from a Chilean court. Pending against her are charges of criminally slandering President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and the armed forces he commands. By law she must get approval to go abroad, but she brushes that aside as just a minor annoyance compared to periodic arrests, two stints in prison and daily death threats in the four years since she took on what she calls `` the holy trinity'' _ <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, his family and the military. Her articles accusing <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and his right-wing government of abuse of power were cited by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nieman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in awarding her this year's <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Prize </PERSON>. It praised her `` courage in reporting objectively and honestly ... despite the government's efforts to silence her.'' She plans to travel to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to accept the award Sept. 15, but with a certain chagrin. `` There are lots of -LRB- Chilean -RRB- journalists who are facing legal charges, but most are n't as famous as I,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 38, said in an interview. `` This bothers me a lot sometimes.'' According to the local <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights office, more than 30 journalists face criminal slander charges lodged by the government. They include Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' boss, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, director of the leftist magazine <PERSON> Analisis </PERSON>. He was convicted of offending the armed forces and is serving 541 nights in a jail cell. He is at liberty during the daytime. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> cites the existence of Analisis and several other opposition publications as proof that <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has freedom of the press. But according to Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, `` There's a very high cost. It's a cost you pay every day.'' She said her telephone rings constantly with death threats, that cars full of armed men regularly park outside her home, that a dead cat was once tossed into her yard. `` Certainly I'm afraid.'' she said. `` I'm afraid they'll kill me. But I've made a choice. I've taken a path of no return.'' The choice was made in late 1983, she said, when she began working for another opposition magazine, <LOCATION> Cauce </LOCATION>. At the time, a wave of anti-Pinochet protests obliged the government to somewhat relax its strict control of the news media. In early 1984, the magazine published the first of a series of investigative reports by Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> alleging corruption by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and members of his family and brutal human rights abuse by the military. The articles, which presented documentation and detail, established her reputation as one of the country's best opposition journalists and shattered a powerful taboo. `` We broke a sacrosanct rule that existed in the opposition press: do n't mention <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, his family or the armed forces. This is the holy trinity,'' she said. In the years since, Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has been arrested 10 times and imprisoned twice in connection with her reporting. Her first imprisonment was in July 1984. She said she was put in a small, exposed cell in a maximum-security punishment block occupied by about 20 common criminals who had led a prison riot three months earlier. Many still wore bandages on their wounds. She was the first woman they had seen since being isolated, and regularly beaten, after the riot, she said. They filled the hall outside her cell, screaming and pressing against the bars while they exposed themselves and performed obscene acts. The bars were thin, and she feared they would cave in. `` It went on all night long,'' she said. `` I did n't think I was going to be able to stand it. It was very terrible.'' The next morning, at her tearful insistence, she was moved to a section for woman political prisoners. She spent six days there before being released. She would return in October 1987, for 22 days, after publishing an interview with an opposition leader, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, who sharply criticized <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The case sent chills through the Chilean jouralistic community and prompted denunciations from press organizations around the world. Although the interview was published in textual, question-and-answer form, Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> _ and not <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON> _ was charged with slandering the president. Government prosecutors said she was responsible because she served as the vehicle for his remarks. The case remains pending, as do two others, in which she is accused of slandering a military prosecutor and the armed forces in general. Five previous cases against her have ended in acquittal. She said she considers her most important story a series of interviews in late 1984 with a deserter from the secret police who recounted the torture and killing of 15 leftists. Some were old friends of hers, she said. In seeking confirmation of the deserter's tale, she sought the help of a human rights activist, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrada </PERSON>, and a Communist who survived detention by the secret police, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parrada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, along with a third man, <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Nattino </PERSON>, were found dead with their throats slashed in March 1985. `` Why they let me live, I do n't know,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` Here they punish journalists who make terrible denunciations: murders, torture, disappearances, corruption. But they do n't investigate the actions being denounced That's hard for me to accept.''

<HEAD>Egyptians Shut Down Brick Factories to Save Fertile Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIZA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fertile soil is sparse in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> _ just 6 million acres along the Nile _ and the government is cracking down on those who use it to make bricks. At a brickyard here one recent day, workers swarmed like bees over a kiln as they dismantled a brickyard that had fallen victim to the government order. The government's intend is to preserve <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s arable land to help feed an exploding population _ now 53 million and growing at a rate of 1.2 million a year. After five years of loose application of a law banning the use of fertile topsoil to make bricks, the government in December set a six-month deadline and recently sent police out to see that an estimated 1,700 affected brickyards indeed close down. `` We admit that this is the first time the law has been effective,'' said <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON>, head of the department responsible for land protection at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` The owners realized that we were serious this time and all the brickyards stopped functioning on deadline without violence.'' The decree requires brickyard owners to switch from the age-old process of making bricks by hand with topsoil to a mechanized one that makes bricks only with pure clay, thus eliminating the use of topsoil. Violators of the topsoil ban face six months in prison and a fine. Officials acknowledged that the decree has troublesome side-effects: a growing black market in bricks and unemployment for about 70,000 workers. Only 41 of the dismantled brickyards so far have switched to the mechanized method, at a cost the equivalent in Egyptian pounds of $ 13,000 to $ 650,000, <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> said. He added that 200 others were expected to follow suit. `` At the moment, the price of bricks is rising steeply because of the law enforcement,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramez </PERSON>, responsible for building-material control at the Housing Ministry. He said black market prices of the machine-produced bricks are double the official $ 30 for 1,000. `` We expect to have a complete balance between supply and demand within five years,'' <PERSON> Ramez </PERSON> added. The enforcement of the law, he said, has resulted in a shortage of 2 billion to 3 billion bricks this year. Officials estimate that about 4,500 acres of arable land have become unproductive in the last 20 years because topsoil was stripped for bricks. The loss is considerable for a country that produces only 40 percent of its food and must import the rest to feed its burgeoning population. `` Some people used to remove earth down to 10 meters -LRB- 30 feet -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` Any removal weakens the soil, taking away essential nutrients, and raises the water table. `` We are requiring owners to reclaim their land _ at a cost of 10,000 to 15,000 pounds -LRB- $ 4,300 to $ 6,500 -RRB- per acre,'' <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> said. He estimated this would take at least two years. The removal of topsoil began in the early 1970s after the High Dam at <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION> went into operation and held back flood waters bearing tons of silt that originally was used in the brick industry. As construction boomed in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the demand for bricks sky-rocketed, some farmers abandoned their crops to make as much as 70 times more money by selling topsoil or making bricks on their own. `` Earth bricks brought us enormous profits,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Rawash </PERSON>, a former brickyard owner in <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION>. `` In a good month I would make 3,000 pounds -LRB- $ 1,300 -RRB- with earth from one of my acres.'' He maintained that `` no harm is done to land scraped two meters -LRB- about six feet -RRB- deep; anything can be planted on it.'' <PERSON> Abu-Rawash </PERSON> has switched to raising cattle and has turned most of his brickyard into a banana plantation, which he said brings only a quarter of the profit he made from bricks. His employees, whose numbers have been trimmed from 50 to 20, were busy one recent day dismantling one kiln with 22 others to be taken down in the neighborhood. They were worried about their future. `` This is my first day of work since all the brickyards shut down last month,'' <PERSON> Abdel-Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharafeddin </PERSON> said. `` I will work on the other kilns and then who knows? People like me are pushed aside. I know nothing but brickmaking.''

 In the 25 years he spent in jail as one of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest-held political prisoners, <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> could sleep only when the light bulbs in his cell blew out. It happened, he said, about once every three months and when the guards in his Paraguayan prison noticed it they quickly put in fresh bulbs. But the lights burning night and day, the beatings, the submersion in water and 18 years in 6-by-6-foot cell did n't humiliate him as much, he said, as being tortured by a policeman who ranked far below him, a captain in the Paraguayan army `` I never thought a policeman could get away with torturing an officer _ that's a crime,'' the 56-year-old <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> said in an interview here. `` They beat me, tied me up and held me under water, but nothing hurt as much as when they ripped off my captain's braids.'' He was sent to prison Dec. 17, 1962, on grounds that he was involved in a military plot to overthrow <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s longtime authoritarian president, Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, and that he had a role in the death of an army cadet, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> _ charges he has steadfastly denied from the beginning. This past Dec. 17, 25 years to the day he was sent to prison, <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> was released. He was granted political asylum in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in June. <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> blames his suffering on <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, now 75, who has ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> since he seized power in 1954. `` I know he gave the order for my arrest. He robbed me of my career,'' <PERSON> Origoza </PERSON> said. Origoza enlisted in the Paraguayan army in 1949, graduated at the top of his class as a lieutenant and placed fourth when promoted to captain. He was one of five army captains among 20 middle-level officers convicted after <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> moved to smash a rumored plot in army ranks. At the time, <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> was serving as a staff officer to Cmdr. <PERSON> Sixto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dure </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, one of several regiment commanders supposedly involved in the alleged army plot. <PERSON> Dure </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> and the others were subsequently reconciled with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and promoted to the highest posts in the military. `` I knew better than to get involved in some anti-Stroessner game,'' <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> said in the interview. He said he knew of the coup plans, however, through <PERSON> Dure </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. Shortly after his arrest, <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> faced a civil court that found him innocent of all charges. He was then brought before a military court that convicted him of involvement in the coup and the murder of the cadet. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was reduced later to 25 years in prison. `` Police forced me to write a letter implicating myself in the cadet's murder,'' <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> said. `` The lower-ranking officers became the scapegoats, once <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> decided he did n't want to create a shakeup among the higher officers.'' In 1978, the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- OAS -RRB- reviewed <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON>'s case and concluded it was `` arbitary and political'' and a `` very grave violation of his human rights.'' After the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> conclusions, Paraguayan authorities permitted Roman Catholic church officials to visit Ortigoza every four months. His family could visit once a week. He spent the first 18 years of his sentence in what he described as `` brutal conditions'' at a military police facility in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s capital. In October 1980, <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> was moved to a more comfortable 9-by-15-foot cell with a bathroom. `` The idea that sustained me through my time in jail was the certainty I felt that I would some day be able to correct the injustice done to me,'' he said. But his problems did not end with his release from prison in December. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sent <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estanislao </LOCATION> military garrison 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. The Supreme Court accused the ministry of kidnapping <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> and ordered him sent back to <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, where he was then placed under unofficial house arrest at his mother's home. `` After I got tired of that, one of my lawyers helped me to escape in a car,'' <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> said. That was March 23. `` Police guards fired machine guns at the car, but we got away. We had n't planned to go to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, but when we saw the gate to the compound open, we zipped right in.'' <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> spent 83 days there. On June 15, after talks with diplomats from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> dropped its opposition to giving <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> safe conduct out of the country. The next day he arrived in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and immediately departed for <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. Many countries and human rights organizations had called for his release over the years. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> offered him a lifetime pension if he accepted its offer of asylum. But he said he chose <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for `` reasons of language and culture.'' Ortigoza now lives in a faculty apartment at <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he was recently joined by his wife and one of his two daughters. He recounts his experiences to students of Latin American politics in a project funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iberoamerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> `` While <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> is alive there is no chance of reopening my case,'' <PERSON> Ortigoza </PERSON> said in the interview. `` But I am prepared to defend the truth to the end.''

<DATELINE>HARA KHEBIRA, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This dusty <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> village on <LOCATION> Jerba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is inhabited mostly by Jews whose ancestors were among the earliest <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> refugees 2,400 years ago. Uneasy about Israel-Arab tension nowadays, they tend to keep a low profile. Most speak only Arabic and dress like the Tunisian peasants who predominate on the island off <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s southern mainland. Their forefathers came with Phoenician traders after the destruction of <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s Temple in 586 B.C., more than a millenium before the foundation of Islam and the Arab invasions of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Almost throughout this long history, they have lived among the local population in `` harmonious and brotherly coexistence,'' said <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Madar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi, himself born 55 years ago in a Moorish-style family home in <LOCATION> Hara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khebira </LOCATION>. He attributed occasional friction and acts of anti-Jewish vandalism to Arab youths whipped up by events in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> creates some problems for us,'' he said. `` If it were not for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, we would live here as happily as ever.'' <PERSON> Hai </PERSON> <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, a local Jewish jeweler, said the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> population is aware the Jews have unspoken emotional and religious links with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has therefore become `` a political embarrassment for those of us who want to remain in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, the land of our fathers.'' <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> attended a Talmudic school and speaks only Hebrew and Tunisian Arabic. `` We must thank the authorities for all they have done for the survival of the Jewish faith in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>,'' he said through an interpreter. `` We are regarded as an integral part of the <LOCATION> Tunisian </LOCATION> people.'' At the same time, he added, the government makes a distinction between Jews and Zionists, those who try to promote Jewish resettlement in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` The authorities continuously remind Tunisians that a Jew is not necessarily a Zionist,'' he said. `` Those Jews who decide to leave are free to go anywhere. As for me, I was born here, I belong here and I am staying here.'' A police station is in the same building as the synagogue in nearby <LOCATION> Hara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ghriba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mader </PERSON> said he warmly welcomed the police presence at the synagogue, visited by hundreds of tourists daily during the summer season. The 116-square-mile island is among <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s main tourist centers. Painted in blue outside many Jewish homes are symbolic outlines of menorahs _ the candelabra used in Jewish rites _ combined with fish. `` They are intended as a protection against the evil eye,'' <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> said. `` It is a very ancient custom. Jewish doctrine disapproves of it, but we do n't interfere.'' Every year in May, crowds of Jews come on a pilgrimage from <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> and elsewhere to commemorate Rabbi <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhai </PERSON>, an early Jewish mystic reputed to have had special links with <LOCATION> Jerba </LOCATION>. A marble plaque in the Ghriba synagogue claims, `` This sacred and antique place dates from the destruction of <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s first temple in 586 before our era.'' In fact, local records indicate the whitewashed building was erected in the 1920's, the latest in a succession of Jewish shrines built on the same spot over the centuries. Former President <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> attended Jewish religious services there in 1966 to mark his respect for the community. The Jews, <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> said, brought `` baraka'' -LRB- good luck -RRB- to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Despite the official protection, vandals regularly fling garbage over the wall into the four-acre Jewish cemetery in <LOCATION> Hara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khebira </LOCATION>. Many tombstones engraved with Hebrew inscriptions were deliberately smashed years ago. `` We can do nothing about it,'' <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> said. `` If we clean it up, it will only start again.'' The island's police chief said he had received no complaints of anti-Jewish violence or vandalism. The police chief, who can not be identified by name under government regulations, said it was a `` very sensitive subject, a political rather than a police matter.'' One Jewish resident requesting anonymity said complaints only generate more friction. `` We generally live in peace here as long as we keep quiet about those who do n't like us.'' During the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, Tunisian rioters burned down the main synagogue in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, 400 miles to the north. The ringleaders were punished and the government paid for restoration of the building. Most of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s Jews live in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, but they are involved in the capital's modern life and are `` rapidly losing their faith,'' <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> said. `` Only in <LOCATION> Jerba </LOCATION> is our religion intact. Jews here never smoke or drink on the Sabbath. Their children, like mine, attend religious schools.'' Like many of the men in <LOCATION> Hara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khebira </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> was temporarily unshaven in ritual mourning for <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s Temple. Jews enjoyed official protection throughout the five centuries of Turkish, Spanish and French domination. When French colonial rule ended in 1956, some 120,000 Jews lived in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Many had acquired French citizenship. Newly independent <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> backed the Arab cause in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, leading to a massive exodus of the nation's Jewish minority to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> now has only 2,700 Jewish residents, 900 of them in <LOCATION> Jerba </LOCATION>. Tunisian Jews are often craftsmen, tailors, butchers or jewelers. <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> said only one has qualified as an engineer. Many Jews are active in the tourist industry. Very few are wealthy. But several members of a prominent Italian Jewish family named <PERSON> Pariente </PERSON> have elaborate tombs in the <LOCATION> Hara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khebira </LOCATION> cemetery. <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> said the family contributed substantially to the upkeep of <LOCATION> Jerba </LOCATION>'s synagogues The patriarch, <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Pariente </PERSON>, died in l954. His tomb has been desecrated and partly destroyed. Undisturbed nearby are the fresh tombs of <PERSON> Madar </PERSON>'s mother and father. As he passed, <PERSON> Madar </PERSON> knelt down in the burning sun and kissed his parents' tombstones engraved with Hebrew inscriptions.

<HEAD>Land Reform Changing El Salvador's Countryside</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Land reform, the most radical and expensive government project in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s history, has benefited more than half a million people since its inception in 1980 and is radically changing the social structure of the countryside. Despite major shortcomings, the program has redistributed 30 percent of the country's arable land, after compensating former owners. The 520,000 people who have received land, either as individuals or members of cooperatives, make up a quarter of the country's rural poor. The program, however, is beset by such problems as flagging production, tight credit, deficient administration and alleged corruption. It is also hampered by <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s guerrilla war. Land reform was designed, principally by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, as a means of undercutting the leftist guerrillas in their efforts to win the sympathy of the rural poor. A dozen government and military officials, cooperativists, peasants and international development officials interviewed said while the toughest years of land reform are past, obstacles remain in extending it and ensuring its smooth running. `` Some former landowners have not abandoned the idea of recovering their lands and, with them, real power. They recall with nostalgia their wealth,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transformation </ORGANIZATION>, the government body primarily responsible for land reform. But he added that the vast majority of the former owners have accepted compensation, and that title to the property has been legally transferred. The process has cost almost $ 300 million, most of it provided by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Agrarian reform is enshrined in the 1983 constitution, which would have to be scrapped if big holdings were to again be concentrated in few hands. Some left-of-center cooperativists and officials of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are concerned that the right wing, which won control of the legislature in March elections, might try to undo some of the reform. The rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, is considered in a good position to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in presidential elections scheduled for March. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lands </ORGANIZATION>, said a marked increase has been noted in expulsions of land reform beneficiaries in recent months. He blames former owners emboldened by <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s legislative victory and prospects for gaining the presidency next year. `` Most landholders are licensed to carry arms,'' <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON> said. `` The former owners, who have always opposed the reform, are now encouraged and are fighting the campesinos politically, juridically and by force.'' But he said virtually all of the 500 or so recent expulsions were from small holdings and represent a tiny percentage of the reformed sector. He said the government is resorting to the courts and the military to get the small farmers reinstated. He noted, however, that the judiciary has been dominated for decades by the rightwingers who might favor the landowners. Phase I of land reform expropriated all holdings over 1,235 acres, involving 477 properties owned by 262 families. A subsequent Land-to-the-Tiller law affected small holdings and benefited about 45,000 families. The Phase I lands were converted into 329 cooperatives, 25 of which have been abandoned because they are in war zones. About 30,000 families live and work on the 304 Phase I cooperatives. According to <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> and international development officials working with the reform, a third of the cooperatives are able to finance operations, pay debts and dividends to their members. Another third are described as bankrupt `` basket cases'' that can not succeed in their current structure. The remaining third are described as borderline. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s platform calls for the dismantling of all but the most successful cooperatives, dividing the unsuccessful and borderline ventures into parcels that would be transferred by title to the farmers working them. The party contends that only by converting <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> into `` a country of property owners'' will there be sufficient incentive and initiative to spur production. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, after seeing many millions of dollars lost, have already begun dividing up the failed cooperatives into family plots. `` The political decision is to divide,'' said <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>. One divided venture is the 2,100-acre <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Normandia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cooperative </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION> province 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Before being expropriated from <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> in 1980, it produced cotton for export, with small sections dedicated to the corn and beans consumed by the peasants who worked it. Two months into this year's growning season, with abundant rains after two years of drought, it is a green sea of thigh-high corn divided in 8.5-acre plots. It is home for 170 families who live in mud-brick tile-roofed houses with wells but without running water or electricity. It has a school but no clinic. A mile into the fields along an oxen-trod path, <PERSON> Marcial </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> worked with his wife <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and two of their eight children, tending tomato plants along the edge of their plot, most of which was sown with corn. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> talked of his years in the land-reform program. `` From'80 to'86 we had credit from the government and we planted cotton. But we only showed losses. Those who are up in arms -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- would attack each year right before we were going to spray, and destroy or damage the plants. Without pesticide, the crop was always bad,'' he said. Part of the guerrillas' strategy is to sabotage of the national economy, which is heavily dependent on exports of coffee, sugar and cotton. The cooperative decided last year to divide the land into family plots, leaving some fallow and some to be rented or parceled out to eventual new beneficiaries of the agricultural reform. Asked if he'd prefer to continue working as part of a cooperative or have title to his plot, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> responded: `` Both ways are good. Individually, if we have financing, we would probably make the land produce more. But the cooperative could also produce good results under better conditions, and it would provide more work for more people.'' The cooperative is considered one of the `` basket-cases.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ For a nation with its illustrious seagoing past, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has let its merchant marine nearly sink out of sight. Only one in four graduates of the seven merchant marine academies find a berth on an American vessel these days. That seems a waste of hard training, some say, and raises another question: What if another big war or other emergency should suddenly require Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> to find his sea legs again?

 If, without donning scuba gear, you would find out how deep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant marine has sunk into oblivion, consider this: The actual love boat on TV's `` Love Boat'' is Norwegian. Why, then, are one federal and six state maritime academies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still in business when the nation's merchant ships are barely afloat? Are these young sailors training to man a Titanic? Good question, difficult answer. In business the schools are, albeit with trimmed sails. They turn out some 725 graduates a year, only a minority of whom will actually fill a berth at sea. The rest, like their recent predecessors, will find places with port authorities, shipping and stevedoring firms, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, tugboats, ship designers, marinas, yacht yards, an admiralty law office or two. One is relief captain of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> excursion stern-wheeler <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Queen. A few are weathermen. `` The last stand of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant marine is in these academies,'' says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Braynard </PERSON>, museum curator of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at Kings Point on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. A last stand <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> could commiserate with. In 1986, goods worth $ 320.5 billion entered or left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by sea. Only 4 percent of it was in American bottoms. While 90-plus percent of the Earth's trade moves by sea in some 25,000 ships, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant fleet numbered just 371 active oceangoing vessels, 11th worldwide. -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was first with 3,278 ships, <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> second with 2,453. -RRB- The last ocean merchant ship built in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> yard, 76 of which have closed since 1980, was launched last year. None is currently building. None is on order. A presidential commission on the merchant marine and defense headed by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> predicted last December that unless actions are taken the number of ships and seamen will drop by one-half by the year 2000. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Castine </LOCATION>, cites a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> estimate of a shortage of 8,100 trained seamen in the military Sea Lift Command alone. To keep that shortfall from getting worse is one reason the academies survive. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 100 ships mothballed that could be commissioned in five to 10 days in a national emergency. But you ca n't mothball crews to man them. But should there be World War III and should it be fought as the first two, some see the maritime weakness of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the possible Achilles heel. `` Our merchant fleet bears the heavy onus of being the first of our heavy industries exported overseas,'' says Rear Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krinsky </PERSON>, superintendent of Kings Point. `` But we're not static. Buggy whip manufacturers went broke because they thought they were in the buggy whip business instead of transportation.'' Americans are once again pioneering, this time in `` intermodalism,'' the fine art of combining and coordinating road, rail and air freight for sea transport or vice versa. Thirty years ago, half of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s seamen came up `` the hawsepipe.'' The only requirement for promotion was to pass successive Coast Guard exams at minimum three-year intervals on the ladder from seaman to mate to captain or chief engineer. Today, 17 percent of licensed officers are graduates of Kings Point alone. The first academy for commercial mariners dates back a century. The progenitor was Adm. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, a graduate of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> where merchant sailors have been mildly deprecated as `` the black shoe navy.'' <PERSON> Luce </PERSON> proposed that coastal cities set up facilities to train sailors. In 1874, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> acquired the old sloop-of-war <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> use </ORGANIZATION> as a floating school. She was succeeded by the armed frigate Newport which was towed around the harbor with faculty and students to wherever the cheapest berth could be found. In the 1930s, President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, a former naval person, eyed <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> entrance to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as a site for a permanent land school. The fort, which had never fired a shot and whose only scar was a bar sawed out by a prisoner escaping from the brig, was also eyed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s road-park-bridge visionary, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> `` It would make a fine park,'' said <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>. `` A fine school,'' said the president. So the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Maritime Academy moved in among the cannons and abides, now a part of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and named <ORGANIZATION> SUNY </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> saw the need for a federal counterpart, a complement to <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant marine had been embarrassed in 1934 by the burning of the <LOCATION> Morro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> coast, which took 125 lives. Some officers abandoned ship before the passengers. Fire hoses did n't fit. Professionalism was needed. And there was war in the air. To <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the merchant marine was the fourth arm of the military. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 thereupon created a national maritime academy.

 Of this June's 213 graduates -LRB- 17 of whom were women, eight of those engineers -RRB-, 28 entered the military, about the recent average. Thirty percent of the class of'87 found slots at sea, 45 percent jobs ashore, 20 percent joined the military and 5 percent went on to graduate school. All students receive a year's training aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag merchantman. <ORGANIZATION> SUNY </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, sends its 750 students out for two months every summer aboard the Empire State, the former passenger liner President <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. They do everything from navigating to running the engines to chipping paint. `` The advantage of our system over Kings Point is that our students run the ship under supervision. They are at the mercy of whatever captain they serve under as to how much they are taught,'' says Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, the academy's vice president. <ORGANIZATION> SUNY </ORGANIZATION> grads must also be able to tie 21 knots, which most put off learning until the last minute, unaware that a horney-handed bos' n will time them with a stopwatch. They have to swim, too. `` Our kids have more flexibility than Kings Point,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SUNY </ORGANIZATION> director for community affairs. `` Kings Pointers have their service commitment. Ours in dry times can go to places like <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> if they are engineers. A marine architect can go into an architectural firm. We can also take older students, foreigners and those who ca n't pass the Kings Point physical.'' With the prevalence of union requirements, it is a rare tar these days who becomes an officer up the hawsepipe. `` And probably only a foolhardy one even tries,'' says <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. `` Few seek out the academies because of the romance of the sea,'' says <PERSON> Krinsky </PERSON>. Quickly loaded containers have done away with languorous or lascivious days in port. Students come for technical training or because friends or family had. `` They are middle-class, achievement-oriented kids who have been encouraged by parents and teachers,'' <PERSON> Krinsky </PERSON> says. `` Their SATs are n't Harvard-Yale, but their achievement is comparable after graduation.'' Kings Point alumni are a who's who of leaders in the maritime world. `` Kings Point's focus is more narrow than ours,'' says <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>, whose school offers so many courses that students, uniformed as are those at Kings Point and other academies, ca n't march to class. `` They are training future officers. Ours get that training, plus.'' Twenty-five years out, just over half of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> grads are still in the maritime field, a slightly better record than the other service academies. Sixty percent of the Fort <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON> graduates go into the maritime business and the rest into allied occupations. One, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobson </PERSON>, was tactician on an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup defender. <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON> has benefited handsomely by being official sponsor of several Cup yachts which it gets to sell when the races are over. Besides the school in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, there are maritime academies in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, all state-run. `` And all of them,'' says <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, `` are concerned with dwindling enrollments.'' A forthright commencement speaker at any of the academies would warn that the sea, American-style, is not an encouraging field. There are billets for only 4,116 deck and engineering officers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag vessels. `` In 1980, 80 percent of the graduates of maritime academies found shipboard positions,'' says <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, president of Seatrain Lines. `` This number was reduced to about 25 percent last year.'' To share the work available, unions rotate jobs so that some mariners are at sea only four months a year. For years, neglect, vacillating policies, greed and crime have beset the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant fleet. Dockside theft was so bad in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> one shoe company sent the lefts in one shipment and the rights in another to frustrate two-legged looters. The unions, once a favorite whipping boy to blame for the high costs of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipping, `` are ready for an agreement with anyone,'' says <PERSON> Braynard </PERSON>. `` It's very hard to say they are to blame. When they were riding high, they rode high. But they were no more lousy when they had power than the shipowners when they did. It's a human nature situation.'' Human nature, however, has not launched ships since <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> of Troy. Economics does. And military need. Here again it's an Alice in Wonderland world. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does have a respectable container fleet. But you ca n't fit a tank in a box. Container ships need dockside cranes. You do n't find those on invasion beaches. To qualify for the $ 250 million in operating subsidies Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> pays American shipping a year, the ships must be built in American yards. But, as the <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> commission noted, American yards are a highly endangered species, even for military vessels. A South Korean yard can build a ship for a third of what an American yard would charge. Several years ago <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recognized this by `` opening a window'' to let <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies build overseas. Then it closed the window. At the same time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers are required to replace their fleets periodically in order to qualify for subsidies. In such logical whirlpools the American merchant marine spins rudderless, to some observers. `` I do n't think we can be totally dependent on the rest of the world,'' says <PERSON> Krinsky </PERSON>. `` Who would ever say, let foreign airlines on our domestic routes? Or foreign railroads? But shipping..? In step with Reaganomics, Kings Point has cut back enrollment 25 percent over the last five years. If the merchant marine were simply a commercial industry, this might be a resigned acknowledgement of the practicalities. If, on the other hand, the merchant marine is indeed an arm of the military, should n't this be as alarming as the scuttling of every fourth aircraft carrier? To the staffs of the maritime academies, it is.

 The decline of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant marine seems all the more notable in a nation with an illustrious seagoing past. In its birth and infancy, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was basically an island. You had to take a boat to get there. Ships were the highways of the Colonies. Seamen, still boys, `` came up the hawsepipe'' to learn before the mast. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowditch </PERSON>, the great navigator, got his start selling pulleys and marlin spikes as a young ship chandler until he learned enough ropes to go to sea. Young lads from <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> shipped out on whalers across the globe, came home after years and signed on again as mates. Whalers lit the lamps of a young nation. Slavers in their vile trade populated the cotton fields. Ship-borne immigrants populated the whole country. Fast American-designed clippers from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> out-sped the world around the Horn in the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trade. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> drove the first practicable steamboat on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1789, 20 years before <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>. -LRB- <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> also demonstrated he was ahead of his time by dying of a morphine overdose. -RRB- In 1806 <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON> displayed <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> maritime ingenuity by eschewing <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> as `` a place for loafers like all colleges'' and exporting around the world what wintry <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> had plenty of: ice. The tide began turning in the 1840s when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> subsidized the new Cunard Line on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> run. In 1847 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> followed suit by subsidizing building ships for the <ORGANIZATION> Bremen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, jointly owned by Americans and the city-state of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>. Carrying the flag became national policy and pride. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, shippers were thus over the years alternately lulled and starved by congressional and presidential whim with the purse strings. The real deep-six was epitomized by the man <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Braynard </PERSON>, curator of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, calls `` that wretch, <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON>,'' when he advised <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s young men to go West They did, ironically in prairie schooners. A nation turned its back on its ocean heritage. `` The seaman changed from the town hero to the local drifter,'' says <PERSON> Braynard </PERSON>, a steam-fired advocate of a return to maritime greatness. `` The need for labor in the Unitred States was so great any loose men were drawn to jobs in the heartland.'' Never again would an increasingly rich <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> be able to match the low wages, often heavily subsidized, of foreign merchantmen. The glory days were largely done. In the century after the Civil War, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> built only 10 liners for the lucrative <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> passenger business. Not that know-how did n't exist. In World War II, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> built 6,000 ships, a third of the world's merchant fleet, to defeat <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Using assembly line techniques, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> yard built a 10,000-ton Liberty Ship in just over three days. But at the end of the war the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which by then had almost half of the world's tonnage, gave away much of its fleet to its stricken allies, a nice thing to do, particularly for some wily Greeks with names like <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Niarchos </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Yanks </ORGANIZATION> did not lose their ingenuity. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> started the container ship revolution with the bright idea of putting truck trailers on the unused deck space of a coastal tanker. Americans invented the ship that loads and unloads itself with its own lighters. `` Then the whole world zapped us with our own ideas,'' says <PERSON> Braynard </PERSON>, his exasperation at full ahead.

 Drop two bits into an old-fashioned, mahogany jukebox in a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> tavern, and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> will spin a memory in the form of a song. It's a jukebox with a twist _ a human jukebox with a collection of more than 100,000 records dating back to the 1920s and an assortment of customers who would never plunk a quarter into cheap, mechanical imitations. `` If you want to hear ` Squaws Along The Yukon' or head-banging music, you can. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> has everything,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Casagrande </PERSON>, 39, owner of Brandy's Restaurant, which has had Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON>'s `` telephone music'' for 10 years `` You can come in here depressed, and you hear these songs and all of a sudden it really does boost you up,'' says <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, as she stirs a drink at Brandy's bar. `` I hope this woman is a millionaire because she deserves to be. If she only realized the pleasure she brings to people.'' Pick up a black phone on top of the jukebox, and a raspy voice at a studio across town cheerily asks your preference. Not sure of the title? No problem. Hum a few bars and chances are Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> knows it. Afraid the song is a little dated or obscure? For an extra $ 1, she'll head to the attic and blow the dust off the less-popular tunes. Want to personalize the song? An additional 50 cents buys a dedication. `` Attention, your attention, please,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> broadcasts into one of the five bars she services. `` This next song is a special dedication to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. We hope you get lucky tonight, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>.'' How it all works is not quite clear to Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON>. Her father devised the system about 60 years ago by using old radio tubes and copper telephone lines. When he died 12 years ago, the secret of telephone music went with him, and his daughter claims no one has been able to duplicate it. Songs are played over telephone lines from a studio on the city's <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> to speakers in the bars around the city. `` Studio,'' though, may be too grand a word. It's actually a second-floor walk-up hidden _ because of the extensive record collection _ in a boarded-up brick building approached from a dimly lit courtyard off a back alley. The linoleum is worn, the walls need a fresh coat of paint, and any unusable space is covered with papers, ashtrays or coffee cups. Row after row of records line the perimeter of the small room, and opposite a switchboard are three tiers of turntables. `` Everybody has a wild fantasy of what the place looks like. It can be anything they want,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON>, a salty woman who calls everyone `` babe'' or `` honey.'' `` They imagine me as a 27-year-old blonde or whatever. They think we're beautiful and sexy.'' Although Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> wo n't give her age, she was slightly miffed when a local columnist said her `` salad days are wilted.'' Upon hearing a shrill `` ping-ping'' sound, which signals two quarters being deposited in a jukebox, Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> plugs a wire into the switchboard and picks up her handset. `` Telephone music. What do you want to hear, hon?'' No one answers. `` Number please. This is your jukebox talking. I can hear you laughing ... What were you doing? ... You lost a quarter under the machine,'' she says, chuckling. `` Do n't do that, if you move it and it do n't play, I'll be on your you-know-what. Go ahead, honey, I'll give it to you Do n't worry about it. We'll leave it for the sweeper.'' The caller requests `` Teach Me Tonight'' by the <PERSON> DeCastro </PERSON> sisters, one of several irreplaceable records held together by duct tape. Other records, especially the old 78s, are so warped coins have to be placed on the arm of the turntable so the needle does n't skip

 Although the quality of the recordings is n't first-rate, a corps of regular telephone music customers would rather have a scratchy song than none at all. `` On most of the cracked records we have ` Watch, sticks,' so we can monitor it and catch it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> says with a throaty laugh. `` But sometimes if you're real busy and do n't pay attention and it's going, ` clunk, clunk, clunk,' the bartenders will call up and say, ` You're playing our song again.''' Decades ago _ Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> is n't sure how many _ her father owned several studios and had 120 jukeboxes distributed in bars around the country. But telephone music waned with the popularity of radio and home stereo systems and, little by little, the slick, handmade jukeboxes were put into storage. When her father died, Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> took over the business for sentimental more than monetary reasons. Bar owners get 40 percent of each quarter dropped into their jukebox and Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> gets 60 percent. With only five jukeboxes out, the trickle of quarters is n't enough to pay the volunteers who help her on weekends. `` I inherited it from my father and I did n't know what to do,'' she says. `` It was his baby, his dream,'' she says. Dream analysis is her true love, and she'd rather devote more time giving classes than spinning records. But she says she keeps hanging on `` like a rat terrier,'' even though there have been times she's been unable to pay her bills. `` It's a love thing with the people on the jukebox,'' she says. `` People will call up that have n't been in town for years and tell me what they're doing. One guy came on and said, ` Do you remember me?' He said, ` There is n't a day that goes by I do n't think of you and this jukebox and what all it meant to me.''' `` I would hate to see it go, plain and simple,'' says <PERSON> Casagrande </PERSON>, who has a group of customers who conduct impromptu sing-alongs with the help of the jukebox every Friday night. `` It's not the money. We make more on a couple of drinks than on the jukebox,'' he says. `` It's just the fact that it's part of the entertainment. People come here with that in mind, to hang around the jukebox.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> is also more than a source of music. Her contagious laughter and easygoing banter can shake the blues for many a lonely customer, like the time she dedicated the song `` Looking For Love In All The Wrong Places'' to a downhearted patron who lost his girlfriend to another man and wanted to hear `` Your Cheating Heart'' a dozen times. `` We're psychiatrists, psychologists, girlfriends. It's not just a record. It's that one-on-one conversation,'' she says. `` Most people in bars are lonely. They're sitting there and nobody's talking to them. So they go up and they put a buck in the jukebox and turn around and say, ` What do you want to hear?' Everybody looks and says, ` Hey, baby, I'll take this.' It's a way of making friends because music is a common denominator.'' Music is also a way to reminisce through that special song that tugs at romantics' hearts or makes an old man tap his toes. `` How many people can be instantly gratified for whatever moment they want?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> asks. `` When you have over 100,000 selections, you can reach everyone.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> does n't profess to having favorites, but there is one tune that breathes life into the distant past. When the requests slow down and she's feeling nostalgic, she plays a song her father recorded decades ago as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION>, a barbershop quartet. It's a special song for many reasons. Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON> was raised by her mother but always longed to be closer to her father, and hearing his voice among the thousands of records he collected over the years helps keep the bonds alive. `` I was only in my dad's life for holidays,'' she explains while positioning the record on the turntable. `` That hunger was always there to be with my dad, and when I finally got here, he's dead.'' The record is scratchy and worn, and it's hard to make out all the words or hear each voice, but it's pure music to Mrs. <PERSON> Reutzel </PERSON>. `` Do you hear it?'' she says, her face lighting up. `` That's my dad. That's him.''

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>'s love of flying is fundamental. He learned to fly at 16. Owns a biplane. Flies at air shows. `` Most people who love the sky ca n't be as happy on the ground as other people,'' he says, as if stating an obvious truth. But even he did not suspect that simple curiosity about a fellow pilot long dead could turn into an obsession that would consume his life for 10 years until he could search out and write down every detail he could discover about a remarkable American named <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` The man became important to me,'' says <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. `` He was from my hometown, <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, from my <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, from my South, and he belongs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a true hero. I wanted everyone to know about him. `` I once told someone that when I finally finished the book and had gotten it published maybe his spirit would leave me alone.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>'s book, `` The Brown Condor: The True Adventures of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>,'' was published recently by <ORGANIZATION> Bartleby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Whether <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s spirit now lets him go remains to be seen. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> still does not seem to tire of talking about <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> or about how he managed to find all that rich detail about his extraordinary life. It turns out that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, against improbable odds, not only became an accomplished pilot and instructor in the 1920s but also trained a small cadre of pilots for <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> when that country was invaded by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> as a prelude to World War II. He became Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>'s personal pilot and consultant and later helped establish an Ethiopian airline. A small item in the 75th anniversary edition of the <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Herald </ORGANIZATION> was what set <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> on his 10-year quest. It was a line from an old 1930s book, a WPA book, called `` A Walking Tour of <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>,'' and it said: `` If you cross the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad you will come to the Big Quarter and at 30th Avenue see the home of the pilot <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Condor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, knew its history, knew the Big Quarter was the old black section of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>. He also knew his aviation history. `` I said to myself, are they trying to tell me a black man from <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> could get a pilot's license back in those days? Impossible. Aviation was one area where blacks were thoroughly excluded. That was just a fact. `` But if it were true, I figured I might have a little article for one of the flying magazines I contributed to.'' He knew an elderly woman, <PERSON> Miomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Godine </PERSON>, who was black and also a <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> native. He asked her if she had ever heard of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` She said, ` Why, yes, I knew him. He used to walk me to Sunday school.' She also told me that, yes, he had been a pilot, had died as a result of an accident on a rescue mission in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1954 _ and that his sister lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Godine </PERSON>'s memory was clear, and her recollections stirred <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>'s curiosity all the more. It was worth a trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to confirm the improbability of what he was hearing. It was after his visit with Mrs. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> that curiosity became obsession. Back in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> installed himself in the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Herald </ORGANIZATION> library and read every page of every paper from most of 1934 through 1936. It produced a few incidents, leads. He found old clippings at <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had learned automotive mechanics in 1924. He found <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s footprints in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> where he had landed a job at a Curtis-Wright flying school sweeping out classrooms while class was in progress, and listening, and where <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and another black mechanic, <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, had built their own airplane using a motorcycle engine. He found <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>. He found a photo of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> at the Air and Space Museum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but they knew nothing more about him. On that trip, though, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> met <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. He grew up in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, and, being black, he was able to interview people who might have been leery about my motives. Pretty soon <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> was caught up in the project as much as I was.'' The search for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> apparently had that effect on everyone snagged in <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>'s net. `` Every time I thought, well, this is all I'm going to get,'' he says, `` another door would open, which in turn led to another door, and so on.'' Once, announcing an air show in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, in honor of pioneering pilot Al Key, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> turned to the honoree and said, `` By the way, <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, did you ever hear of a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> back in the old days?'' Key became a wellspring of anecdotes about <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. So it went. `` It was easy to become fascinated by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, especially for a Southerner, especially for black Southerners. They knew how the system worked back then and what it took to lick it, as <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had. `` It was purely because of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s accomplishments that <PERSON> Tuskegee </PERSON> was included in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s program to train pilots for World War II _ black pilots. He knocked down that barrier. `` I suppose I grew to love the man, in the sense that even though I'm white I could identify with some of the struggles he went through. I understood his having to go to another continent to get his opportunity to excel.'' Not long ago, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, a space shuttle pilot, who is black, visited <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> met him _ and gave him a ride in a biplane, something the astronaut had never flown in. `` The trail in aviation leads from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was the spark. `` I guess I got caught up in that notion and could n't let it go.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Change seems to be the rule in our fluid, mobile society, but stepping from one way of life into another seems to follow an unchanging pattern, distinct phases, whether the actual departure is abrupt or not. And `` role exit,'' as one scholar calls it, is seldom easy.

 Whether you've become an ex-wife, ex-junkie, ex-surgeon, ex-hooker or ex-nun, you go through the same psychological process in moving from one role to another, according to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sociologist, herself an ex-nun, now married and the mother of two. Dr. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON>, Sister <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> for 11 years, has called this process `` role exit'' and her dream is not that her book, `` Becoming an Ex,'' becomes a best seller, but that the concept of `` role exit'' finds its way into introductory psychology texts. She says she did not coin the phrase, but she was the first to research it through interviews with 185 persons and discover the similarities and the stages people go through as they leave one role in life and move to another. Her own `` role exit'' was a happy one. `` I thoroughly enjoyed my life as a nun,'' she says. `` I grew up in a small <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, German community in <LOCATION> Olfen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where at 18 women had the choice of getting married or joining the convent. The nuns were unwitting feminists back then in that they were the only educated role models we had,'' she says. `` Education was important to me.'' She taught the fourth grade and later at Our Lady of the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> while she worked on her master's degree at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. She then went to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to win her doctorate. It was then that she began the first stage of role exit, the doubting. She wondered whether the religious life was for her. She felt a strong desire to be married and have children. She soon met her husband-to-be, a psychiatrist, who was going through a divorce, and a doctor friend was wrestling with whether he really wanted to be a doctor. She noticed that all three of them were experiencing similar emotions as they moved from one role to another. Her research verified that the similarities are strong, even when the exit is traumatic, even when a mother chooses to give up custody of her children in order to get out of a terrible marriage. <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON> also realized that in today's society, with a high divorce rate, high mobility, and second careers, role exiting had a much broader reach than it did back when marriages were for life and people usually retired with a gold watch in the city in which they were born. After the first doubts, where people may become frustrated, burned out, or just realize their unhappiness, comes what she calls the unconscious cueing stage. A prostitute she interviewed allowed herself to get pregnant and then left her business because she did not wish her child to suffer the stigma of a mother in the world's oldest profession A young mental health worker, whose <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> kept breaking down, replaced it with a truck. He explained it was for hauling dogs and camping. He owned no dogs and did not camp. In retrospect, he says that he always thought he might want to go into the construction business, which he eventually did. In the convent, subconscious cueing was often spotted in hairstyles. Those nuns who allowed their hair to grow longer and styled it more fashionably were those getting ready to role exit. In the second stage, people seek alternatives, sometimes tangibly and sometimes in their imaginations. Married people may agree to a temporary separation. Business people may take a leave of absence. Third is the action stage, the departure. <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON> found that 20 percent of the exiters went through a gradual, evolutionary process. The vast majority experienced an identifiable turning point. Sometimes it was emotional, as a spouse's overwhelming feeling that ending the marriage at once was the only way to preserve sanity. A Protestant minister, discontended with life in a fish bowl, hearing criticism if he had a social cocktail and also if he did n't, decided to look for other work after hearing a woman describe him as `` unprofessional.'' A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employee whose job entailed much travel resigned when his wife left him, deciding he needed to stay at home to raise his son properly. But there are many people, <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON> says, `` for whom that critical event does n't occur and who remain entrapped in roles they do n't like. The fourth stage is creating a new identity. `` It is important to incorporate your old role into your new identity,'' says <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON>, `` and to keep a few mementos or photographs. Eventually, even if it was a traumatic exit, it is good to have these things to look at when they are not so emotion-charged.'' `` It is important to maintain contact with some people in the old role, to keep some bridges,'' she says. `` You do n't want to totally close the door to the past, because a hangover identity will be there. It's also important to be able to talk to someone about who one used to be.'' Many of the interviewees reported the worst part was a sense of being in a `` vacuum'' when they switched roles. Divorcees, for instance, were n't married but did n't quite feel single. Mothers who gave up custody had the hardest time. `` Most of these women were unable to support themselves, much less their children, at the time of the divorce and so they gave up custody for the sake of the children,'' she says. Then, after a few years, when the woman has put her life back together, either through remarriage or work, they find they can support the children and try and get them back. `` Judges do n't usually reverse custody,'' says <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON> `` and these women are still mothers, but without their children.'' <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON> also writes about the problems of disclosing the past, particularly when the role exit was positive, such as becoming an ex-convict or a recovering alcoholic. The problem is that the label may persist. Dr. <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON> limited her research to people who made voluntary exits, not people who suddenly lost jobs. `` I suspect they go through the same stages, but the timing is probably different,'' she says. Recently <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON>, now 46, attended what would have been her 25th anniversary had she stayed in the convent. `` It was a wonderful kind of closure for me,'' she says. `` I also realized it was a wonderful experience.''

 Noting an unusually high percentage of prisoners who are hard of hearing _ almost half in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ some researchers suspect the disorder may contribute to criminal behavior. `` My working hypothesis is that hearing loss may be the first link in a chain of events or circumstances that eventually lead to a life of crime,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communicative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorders </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> found that 48.5 percent of the inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> suffer some kind of hearing disorder compared with only 7 percent among the general public. The statistics are even more startling because the 7 percent represents the entire general population from infants to the elderly. However, the average age of the prison population is 25, and the younger age group should have a lower percentage of hearing disorders. Other researchers have had similar findings. An <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> study in 1970 indicated 40 percent of the inmates had hearing disorders, a 1986 study in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> cited 36 percent and a 1979 study in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> 17 percent. The ultimate question, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says, is: `` What impact has the hearing loss had on that person's life? Has that hearing loss in any way contributed, directly or indirectly, to the person's criminal behavior and how do you determine that? <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s research team, which includes an audiologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, medical doctor and linguist, is now applying to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a grant for a five-year, follow-up study. The second study will determine the severity, nature and causes of inmates' hearing disorders. He said the amount of the request has yet to be worked out. Corrections officials as well as audiologists and speech pathologists nationwide are concerned about the high level of hearing disorders among prison populations, says <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, manager of audiology and technical assistance for the American <ORGANIZATION> Speech-Language-Hearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. The 56,000-member organization is the largest association of audiologists and speech and language pathologists in the nation. The association called for more research in the field after a task force's cursory look at the problem in 1984. The task force cited a nationwide survey of about 200 state and federal corrections administrators which indicated 77 percent of those polled believe the psychological and communication problems stemming from hearing disorders lead to criminal behavior. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says he has found only a few dozen studies conducted in the past 40 years on any aspect of prisoners' hearing and speech disorders. Of the few studies available, he says, almost all have merely documented the prevalence of problems. If the hearing disorder is congenital or occurred early in the inmate's life, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says, it's likely the handicap helped shape a criminal personality. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s initial research in 1985 did n't indicate the exact nature, severity, or causes of the hearing disorders because there was n't enough money for detailed hearing tests or medical evaluations. The initial study involved merely testing each <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> inmate's hearing at different frequencies and comparing that to a normal person's hearing range <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> compares the initial auditory screening test to a simple eye chart used by an opthalmologist. The doctor knows the patient ca n't see the letters at a certain size, but more tests are needed for a diagnosis of the problem. There could be many causes for the hearing disorders, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says, including heredity and loud noises as well as lack of medical attention to ear infections or other problems in childhood. Even relatively minor hearing losses could damage a child's personality development, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says Many children with undetected hearing disorders grow up without ever knowing they're physically different from their peers. However, they must deal with considerably more stress and disorientation. `` It may sound like mumbling,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says. `` It would be like you trying to interact with someone with a very heavy foreign accent. If you have to listen to them for a long time, it will tire you out. You have to channel and focus your attention to comprehend.'' The strain may make the child irritable, and he may appear to have an extremely short attention span. Some children with undetected hearing losses may grow up able to capture words, but the emotions attached to the words escape them, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says. `` Consider a preschool child who has a hearing loss. Not a real terrible hearing loss. The child learns to talk, but it is severe enough that the child has trouble hearing the meaning of things,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says. `` Not only do you hear what is said. But you hear how it's said. You hear inflections, things like that. You can read my moods and emotions.'' An inability to follow the emotional trains of thought of others could trigger all kinds of anti-social tendencies, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says. Add the emotional and intellectual handicaps from a hearing disorder to the underprivileged status of many children and you get a prime candidate for prison, he says. `` If that scenario is sometimes correct, theoretically we can sometimes prevent crime by dealing with hearing problems and language problems at a preschool age,'' he says. Some preschool programs such as Head Start do some hearing screening, but many children do n't have hearing tests until kindergarten or much later _ after personality traits are long entrenched. `` I did n't have my first hearing test until I got back from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> says.

 It's a small step in a quarrelsome world, but <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> became best friends again after a bitter falling out over a ruined stereo speaker. Chalk one up for the 10th-grader who mediated and the <ORGANIZATION> Mackenzie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conflict </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> _ in turn an offshoot of the more formidably named Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Founded in 1965 when the Vietnam War roiled campuses, the university center then was all but alone in a field that now counts more than 100 such programs. The center operates on a shoestring budget of $ 52,000 annually, with a staff of two. It has struggled to pay its bills, adapt to changing times and gain academic prestige. It offers undergraduate courses in areas such as dispute resolution, the physics of nuclear war, the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War and union-management relations. e.'' After cooling down a bit, the girls agreed to split the cost of the speaker. According to <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, director of the center's conflict resolution training program in the high schools, its goal goes beyond helping students get along better. `` We make the ties to a larger view of the world as a place where the same techniques of conflict resolution can be used,'' she says. Some on the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> campus are n't happy with the center's `` view of the world'' and its advocacy of what they see as a particular political position `` At the time the center was founded, it attracted a number of the liberal and left-liberal faculty members,'' says retired geography Professor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dohrs </PERSON> said. `` What the center has had ever since is a strong liberal bias,'' said <PERSON> Dohrs </PERSON>, who led a failed effort in the late 1970s to block creation of a peace studies co-major for undergraduates at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. The center's political bias, he says, has made it a `` miserable failure'' in pursuing open academic inquiry. `` There obviously is a good deal of suspicion here and elsewhere about the existence of peace and conflict studies centers,'' says Professor <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, a historian and adviser to students in the co-major program. Small is author of `` Johnson, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and the Doves,'' a study of the effects of the anti-war movement on presidential decisions in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. While faculty members' political views influence the topics they choose to study or teach, they strive for fairness and objectivity in their classes and writings, he says.

Two $ 6 million grants from <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON>, widow of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON>, have put <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>'s center at the forefront of peace studies programs nationwide. `` We're up against some really hard facts of life,'' <PERSON> Gilligan </PERSON> says. `` It's extremely important that the educational establishment, all the way down to the kindergarten level, through graduate school, get into it. `` We're drifting toward calamity.''

 <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is quick to point out that much has changed in the South since the filming of the 1967 movie, `` In the Heat of the Night,'' starring <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>. In the new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series based on the movie, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, police chief of the small <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Sparta </LOCATION>, the role which earned <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> an Academy Award as best actor. On TV, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> co-stars as <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbs </PERSON>, whose appointment as <ORGANIZATION> Sparta </ORGANIZATION>'s black chief of detectives causes a stir in the Deep South town. `` I'm playing this different from <PERSON> Rod </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the man best remembered as <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> in `` All in the Family.'' `` <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> played it as Southern police chiefs were in 1967. He deserved his Oscar. Remember the news pictures coming out of the South at that time, with the dogs and the fire hoses. But this is 1988. A lot has happened in the South since then. The old attitude no longer works. `` So the chief is fundamentally still the same, but he knows he has to make accommodations. It's against the law to discriminate against black people and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> is going to make sure the law is obeyed. He's a man in conflict. He learned racism at his mother's knee, but he lives by the law and he respects the law.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is holding court at a table designated by a brass plaque as `` <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s Corner,'' in the Ginger Man, the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> restaurant he has owned for the past 11 years in partnership with actor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. There's a telephone nearby and people stop by to speak to him. Some wave from the sidewalk outside. He's wearing a light-colored summer suit and a bow tie. His hair is snow white, and his eyes, behind his glasses, are a piercing blue. He picks up a pipe and lights up before continuing: `` In the future we're not going to concentrate so much on the crime. You can find that on every police show. We want to show what crime does to the community and what it does to the policemen, and how two men from very different backgrounds feel about it. The white police chief and the black detective have fundamental differences. They have different sentiments, and although crime affects them in different ways they can work together. `` I think that eluded us in the first outing, but I think we'll get it this time People will say it's right on, which is what they said about ` All in the Family.''' The first season of the show was filmed entirely on location in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. But there is talk that the company may go to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the fall season to save money. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> says he found the people of <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> cooperative and the city seemed to him to be fully integrated. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, and their son, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON>, joined him there. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> also works in his father's restaurant. He says that when he completed `` All in the Family'' in 1983 he was n't looking for a new series. `` I wanted to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and do another play,'' he says. `` I did one called ` <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' and it was a miserable flop. Then I did another, ` Homefront,' and it was a flop, but not a miserable flop. Both plays appealed to the audience but if you do n't get the critic for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> your show folds. What you do is end up putting on a play for just one man.'' He also starred in a CBS movie called `` Brass,'' in which he played the chief of detectives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He says it was not a pilot, but concedes that any TV movie with a star is a de facto pilot. He also starred in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` The Father Clements Story.'' `` I did n't do any pilots,'' he says, `` although we talked about some. I was all set to do a show with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. I was going to be a kind of old-time <ORGANIZATION> OSS </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> man who's put in charge of a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> defector. We were to have various adventures together. But they gave me a producer who'd had five flops in a row. I said no and they gave me a month to find someone we'd all be satisfied with. I suggested a couple of guys. That was the last I ever heard from them.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is surprised at how fast his latest series came together. His first series, `` All in the Family,'' bounced from network to network and went through several pilots before <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> finally put it on the air in January 1971. It lasted for 12 years. This time, he says, `` I got a call from <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> and he asked me to meet him.'' <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> was head of programming at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> when `` All in the Family'' went on the air. He later became president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, then <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and currently is a successful independent producer. His other shows include <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Matlock,'' `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fatman,'' now on standby at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, and the `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'' movie series `` We met right here, at this table,'' says <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` He said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is ready to do it. ` If you'll do it, they'll do it.' I've had a lot of people talk to me about series. It usually takes years. Talk, talk, talk. So here is a producer who can put a deal together in two weeks.''

 Ask <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> why she took a chance on Broadway, and the answer comes back in her familiar rapid-fire delivery. `` Are you kidding?'' she machine-guns. `` It's the best woman's role written in the last five years Besides, I wanted to see if I could do it at this stage in my life.'' Could the queen of 23 years of stand-up comedy, the woman who coined the phrase `` Can We Talk?'' -LRB- it's now a federally registered trademark -RRB- and a battle-scarred veteran of the television talk-show wars become a plain, world-weary, middle-class <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> housewife whose marriage and life are falling apart? She could, and she did, earning cheers from audiences and respect from the critics. The role is the centerpiece of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s 1940s autobiographical play `` Broadway Bound.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON> won a Tony Award when she first did it in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> nearly two years ago, but <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> has made the role her own. Her contract with the play, originally for four weeks, has been extended and there is talk she may star in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production when it opens next year. Rivers' success caps a turbulent and tragic year that began in May 1987 when she was unceremoniously dumped from <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s late-night talk show after only seven months on the air. Three months later her husband, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, died from an overdose of Valium. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> was determined to get back to work. `` Broadway Bound'' has been an effective tonic. `` It's the first good experience since my husband died and the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> firing,'' she says simply. `` It's been a very positive thing.'' Rivers sits on a couch in her Madison Avenue hotel suite and works on a needlepoint sampler. <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>, her tiny mop of a dog, sits at her feet and chews contentedly on a bright pink slipper. `` One of the reasons I wanted to do the play was that nobody in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thinks of me as an actress,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> says between stitches. `` They would think of me only as talk-show hostess or a stand-up comic.'' That's a tough reality to face, particularly for someone who says, `` The first thought about what I was going to do with my life was that I was going to be an actress. From infancy on. No question about it.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON>, the original director of `` Broadway Bound'' who came back to the show to help her, offered strong support. `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, ` We do n't want a stunt and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> does n't want it to be a stunt,''' she recalls. `` I came in, read and they offered me the part right there. `` I've been acting for a lot longer than people realize. You're acting every minute when you do a stand-up I knew it was still in me. Timing. Inflection. There's so much to watch when you are building a character. How she walks, how she stands, how she reacts.'' The role of <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> is not Rivers' first venture on Broadway. She appeared in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1971 in `` <LOCATION> Fun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' a play she co-wrote with her husband. `` It's a joy to see my name on the marquee,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> says. `` That's when I say, ` Where's my mother? Where's my husband?''' It was <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> who guided Rivers' career, the one person who knew immediately when something was n't working on stage or in a club. `` He would have told me, ` Do this differently or do that differently,''' she says. `` I miss that part of it so much. He was a brilliant editor, and I had respect for him.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Big Top Pee-wee''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 How does an adult reviewer approach a movie such as `` Big Top Pee-wee''? Very carefully. If you lambaste it as an entertainment aimed at the 5-year-old audience, you might be accurate. But you could also be accused of being a kill-joy and a fogy. If you try to compare it with the innocent comedy of the silent screen, you might also score some points. But you could also be accused of hunting for gold in a pile of dross. So here goes. `` Big Top Pee-wee'' is a clever piece of pure entertainment conceived by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON> and executed by <PERSON> Pee-wee </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, who are the same person. Those who loved `` Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' will adore this one. The story begins with Pee-wee waking up on the most antiseptic farm in the world. Everything is sunny and bright, matching Pee-wee's personality. The animals sleep on mattresss and eat flapjacks at a picnic table. Pee-wee's greenhouse is a wonder. With his magic food supplements, he can grow anything. Even hot dogs. Pee-wee's constant companion is <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, a pure-white pig. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> talks. With a charity seldom seen in comedians, Pee-wee gives <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> most of the punchlines. But then, how are you going to upstage a talking pig? Every day Pee-wee is scheduled for a sandwich lunch with his heartthrob, the local schoolmarm -LRB- <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> -RRB-. For such a shy man, Pee-wee can be aggressive. He throws his body on top of the schoolmarm, who resists him because the schoolkids are watching. And taking snapshots. Then the circus comes to the farm. A new set of animals are roaming the acres, as well as exotic circus people, such as the Italian aerialist -LRB- <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Golino </PERSON> -RRB-, with whom Pee-wee falls in love. The townspeople object to having the circus in their midst, providing a modicum of conflict to the script. Centerstage at all times is Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, a man with a squeaky voice, tight suit and white socks. He is, in the end, an endearing character, guileless yet savvy. He wears well, despite the inane circumstances in which he finds himself. <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON> as the circus boss lends strength, though his three-inch wife -LRB- <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrell </PERSON> -RRB- stretches fantasy too far. <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiser </PERSON> directed in a straightforward fashion. Only one sequence is truly hilarious, and that is borrowed from <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>. When Pee-wee finally makes love with the aerialist, we see a train entering a tunnel -LRB- `` North by Northwest'' -RRB- and skyrockets exploding -LRB- `` To Catch a Thief'' -RRB-. `` Big Top Pee-wee'' was produced by <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, and written by him and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. The rating is PG, perhaps for sexual innuendo. Running time: 87 minutes.

 `` Temple of Low Men'' -LRB- Capitol -RRB- _ Crowded House Crowded House's `` Temple of Low Men'' may be the catchiest depressing album you'll ever hear. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> trio, behind <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>'s sprightly <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney-like </PERSON> melodies and some killer hooks, became one of pop music's most gratifying success stories in 1987 with such hits as `` Something So Strong'' and `` Do n't Dream It's Over.'' But do n't look for any silly love songs on the follow-up `` Temple of Low Men.'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>'s a brooder, worrying about everything from doomed relationships to his own success. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> seems especially wary of love on this album's bookends. `` I Feel Possessed'' describes a lover's spellbinding hold on him, but the narrator is as much scared by the power as consumed by it. And `` Better Be Home Soon,'' addressed to an absent lover, is more a threat than a plea. On `` Mansion in the Slums,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> tells everyone who covets his kind of success that it's not worth it. `` The taste of success only lasts you half an hour or less,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> sings. He declares that he'd much rather have a trampoline than an isolation tank in an obvious jibe at the music business's most tortured success, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Why bother listening to another rock star complaining his life's a mess Because's the music's almost unerringly pretty. `` Better Be Home Soon'' is the kind of lovely ballad <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> used to be able to toss off in his sleep, and the acoustic guitar-based tune will probably benefit commercially from the current singer-songwriter boom. `` Never Be the Same'' and `` I Feel Possessed'' are also particularly strong. There's nothing as instantly accessible as the hits from the first album, but `` Temple of Low Men'' rewards repeated listening. Imagine what Crowded House could do if <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> were happy.

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Showbiz Survivor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a community where `` survivor'' is an overworked word, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> wears the designation with honor. She has been through it all: growing up in the shadow of a tempestuous mother, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>; dancing on the stage of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s hallowed Palace theater at 7 while her mother sang `` Swanee''; dropping out of high school for the sake of show business; watching her mother fall into the deadly spiral of booze and drugs. There were triumphs as well. She won a Tony award in 1965 for `` <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>, the Red Menace.'' On television, her `` Liza With a Z'' brought a coveted Emmy in 1973, and in films she won an Academy Award for best actress for her portrayal of <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> in `` Cabaret.'' There also were two broken marriages to entertainer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and actor-producer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and an addiction to alcohol and drugs that resulted in treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in 1984. But she's here and thriving more than ever with concerts, TV specials and a tour with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, subbing for the ailing <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> is also back in movies. Her return after a lapse of a few years was inauspicious: the short-lived `` Rent-a-Cop'' with <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. She is starring again with <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in `` Arthur 2: On the Rocks,'' which is having a rough time recapturing the gaiety of 1981's original comedy hit. The actress said she had no apprehension about making the sequel because `` the way I found out about it was great. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> called _ we're very good friends _ and he said, ` I want you to read something. I'm not going to tell you what it is; just read it and call me back.' `` When I opened the package and read ` Arthur on the Rocks,' I said, ` Oh, wait a minute, is this a good idea?' Then I read it, and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a wonderful script. `` At first I was worried because the writer and director of the first film was <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and he died, much to all of our sorrow. I did n't think anyone could recapture those characters, but I think <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breckman </PERSON> did a wonderful job. He seemed to have so much affection for the original movie that he caught all the characters.'' In `` Arthur 2,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> again portrays a prank-playing multimillionaire who is seldom without a drink in his hand. Makes you wonder why his wife -LRB- <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> -RRB- sticks with him. `` She loves him,'' <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> said. `` He's her husband, and she'll do anything to defend him and do n't anyone say anything bad about him That's the kind of woman she is. `` Did you ever see the ` Thin Man' series? I went back and looked at them. I learned a lot from <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Loy </PERSON>, and the way she portrayed the wife -LRB- of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> -RRB-. She was completely supportive, and they had fun together. She was interested in everything her husband did. That's how I tried to play <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>. `` Of course some day <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> has to grow up. That's why she leaves him. Sometimes it takes that kind of a shock in people's lives to make them change. Some critics have complained that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s boozing is no longer funny in this era of alcoholism awareness. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> had this response: `` We think back on W.C. Fields and wonderful actors who have played classic American drunks. I think <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> created an entirely new character in <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>; he's so sweet and he tries to be good.'' The daughter of <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Vincente </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> grew up famous. But unlike some other <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> children, she has managed to build a successful career and personal life; she is married to artist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gero </PERSON>. `` I grew up with a lot of love and support from my family,'' she said. `` My family understood this town for what is was: a working town, an industry town. Instead of mining, it happens to be movies. My folks were level-headed. They instilled what I think are very proper values. `` But you can only learn so much, and then you're on your own. You have to either take responsibility for your own life, or keep running it off onto your problems and on to chemicals or alcohol. It's real easy to do, and it's understandable. `` When you realize that you're dependent on anything but the human spirit, you get depressed. With any kind of good help, you can get back on track. You just can.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Minimalism Triumphs for Philip Glass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Minimalist composer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> says his astonishing success in opera over the past decade heralds a return to the spirit of the 1960s. `` I think idealism is something that is becoming acceptable again, if I can put it that way, after a decade of materialism,'' he said. `` The idealism of the'60s, I believe that we're coming back to that,'' he said. `` I think that young people are not all going to be stockbrokers and lawyers. `` I think there's a reaction setting in against that kind of materialism and lack of idealism. And in a way I think that's why we're getting good audiences for these pieces.'' Glass is probably `` the leading contemporary -LRB- opera -RRB- composer of the day,'' said <PERSON> Rheinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauly </PERSON>, a music professor and opera historian at <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` He is one of the few contemporary opera composers who has really developed a strong following. It's unusual for contemporary opera to be really successful.'' Casting simple themes in shimmering repetition and gradual change that fans find entrancing and detractors find stupefying, Glass also has won acclaim in film, theater, dance and other musical modes. In recent years the 51-year-old <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> native has collaborated with singer <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON>, songwriters <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, dance choreographer <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> and stage director-designer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. His recent film scores include `` Koyanisqatsi,'' `` Mishima'' and the recently released `` Powaqqatsi.'' Glass was 39 when his first opera, `` <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> on the Beach,'' was performed at the <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1976. His second, `` Satyagraha,'' an account of <PERSON> Mahatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s development of the tactic of passive resistance as a young lawyer in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, was commissioned by the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and performed in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> in 1980 `` Akhnaten,'' based on an ancient Egyptian pharaoh and first performed in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in 1984, completed a trilogy on `` historical figures who changed the world through the power of their ideas,'' Glass said. All have been sell-outs in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> performances and have been recorded on the CBS Masterworks label. `` Philip Glass operas always sell well,'' said <PERSON> Speight </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have found it -LRB- ` Satyagraha' -RRB- to be the most satisfying of the works,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` I think <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> may be writing better music now, but I also think I have never heard a better text with one of his operas.'' In a recent interview during a visit to promote the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Opera production of `` Satyagraha'' in July, Glass said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s `` stark idealism ... is one of the reasons why I think younger people are very drawn to this work I think younger people tend to be more idealistic than the older folks. `` <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was a man who was an idealist to the end of his days. He proved ... that idealism is n't something you outgrow. You do n't have to It can be something you can carry with you all your life. That, in itself, is an inspiration.'' The Stuttgart Opera has scheduled performances of `` <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>,'' `` Satyagraha'' and `` Akhnaten'' on successive nights in 1990. `` I think of ` <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>' as being the modern, kind of psychokinetic opera, the one that's amplified and full of energy,'' Glass said. `` It kind of goes with the idea of nuclear energy and progressive ideas in science, right? `` I think of ` Satyagraha' as the lyrical opera, which is all flowing, melodic lines and choruses. There's something very gentle about ` Satyagraha.' It's a lyrical opera. `` I think of ` Akhnaten' as the tragic opera of the three, a very dark one, the one that, at a certain moment, you realize no one gets out of here alive.'' His fourth opera, `` The Making of the Representative From Planet 8'' with a libretto by <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lessing </PERSON>, premiered in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on July 8. Performances are scheduled later this year in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. In the script, civilization on another planet is threatened by an ice age. His next, `` The Palace of the Arabian Nights,'' is set for a premiere next year in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and is based `` loosely on the stories of the stories of the Arabian nights,'' Glass said. Last March the Metropolitan Opera gave him a commission for `` The Voyage,'' a three-part allegory based on the exploration of <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>. The premiere is set for October 1992, the 500th anniversary of the sailing of the Pinta, <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Opera `` is the medium of choice for me ... the one in which the composer plays a primary function,'' Glass said. `` The theater is the director's house. The ballet is the choreographer's house. The opera is the composer's house,'' he said. `` I like that.'' From commissioning to staging typically takes three years, he said. `` It takes a year to plan it, a year to write it and a year to build it,'' he said. `` You spend a lot of time involved with your subject, so I am very careful about my subject matter ... they do become part of your life.''

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The latest work by American minimalist composer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> Award-winning playwright <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON>, billed as a science fiction musical drama, has premiered in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, hallowed home of classical opera, to mixed reviews. The 90-minute piece, `` 1,000 Airplanes on the Roof,'' opened before an invited audience of some 500 people July 19 in the unusual setting of a hangar at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s Schwechat airport. The occasional shudder of a jet landing or the rising crescendo of a takeoff punctuated the repetitive rhythms and melodies used by Glass in his technically impressive score for soprano voice synthesizers, flute, piccolo and alto and soprano sax. `` 1,000 Airplanes on the Roof'' tells the story of M., a copy shop worker in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who disappears for four days for an encounter with the supernatural. M. realizes that he has had many such meetings before in his life, but the difference this time is that he remembers what he saw. When he returns to his workplace disheveled and tired, M. is immediately taken to a psychiatrist. Realizing that he should bend to the conventions of a three-dimensional world, he denies belief in what he knows _ that there is a fourth and fifth dimension, and higher intelligence out in space. <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON>, whose `` M. Butterfly'' won the Tony for best play of 1988 on Broadway, said the text is intended to show the tricks memory plays on human beings, and how humans suppress unpleasant recollections in order to preserve a chosen identity. Reviewers for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s two biggest-circulation newspapers opined, however, that <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON> fell short of his high-minded target, praising instead the intricate and attractive stage design of <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON>. `` This is a remarkable science fiction tale for which <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON> concocted a tale full of banal presumptions,'' wrote <PERSON> Karlheinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeschitz </PERSON> in Sunday editions of the Neue Kronen Zeitung. `` The Kafkaesque, critical message that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> and his scriptwriter <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON> wanted to deliver just sinks in empty science-fiction phrases,'' wrote <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dombrowski </PERSON> in Kurier. Praising the technical perfection of Glass' composition, <PERSON> Dombrowski </PERSON> added that `` nonetheless this music of the hard-working Glass remains just a pleasant background to the real work of art of this musical drama, the projections of the designer and architect <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON>, who last year designed the set for <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s worldwide `` Who's That Girl?'' tour, acknowledges borrowing heavily from <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Svoboda </PERSON>, the Czech designer behind <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s famed <PERSON> Laterna </PERSON> <PERSON> Magika </PERSON> theater. Using <PERSON> Svoboda </PERSON>'s technique of projecting slides on to a vast stage set, <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON> creates a constantly changing web of images reflecting M.'s real and imagined surroundings. <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisto </PERSON>, as M., is on stage constantly, adding depth to <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON>'s sets with well-acted mime but struggling occasionally to get across the meaning of lengthy English-language monologues to a German-speaking audience. Jointly sponsored by festivals in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, `` 1,000 Airplanes on the Roof'' cost the organizers of the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> festival, held for the first time this year in the province of lower <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> adjoining urban <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, about $ 375,000. The trio, whose work moves to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and then <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> at the start of a 26-city tour, said they first thought of the idea of a science fiction drama about 18 months ago. The bizarre title of the work emerged from what Glass said was a story he was told separately by three people in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Each reported what felt like an encounter with the supernatural that ended with a crushing noise above their heads, Glass said. They described the sound as `` like 100 airplanes on the roof,'' said the composer, adding `` I just made that 1,000 airplanes.'' And do the authors themselves believe in close encounters of an unnatural kind? `` When we started working, sitting in <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>'s living room, I kind of reluctantly volunteered a story from when I was 10 years old and I saw a UFO,'' replied <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON>. After a while, he recalled, Glass admitted seeing an unidentified flying object once, too. `` With <PERSON> David </PERSON>, we both figured he had probably seen one too, or had some experience that he's still not ready to talk about,'' <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON>, quick to seize on his theme of selective memory, chuckled in reply, `` I forgot.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Musical Salute to Led Zeppelin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the first time in his solo career, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plant </PERSON>, who sang lead in Led Zeppelin for two decades, pays a musical salute to the group that ended its reign in rock' n' roll when drummer <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Bonzo'' <PERSON> Bonham </PERSON> died after a European tour in 1980. On his latest LP, `` Now and Zen,'' Plant has lifted guitar riffs, bridges and musical phrases the group once used in their hot tunes and inserted them into his new work. At the end of `` White, Clean and Neat,'' Plant sings a bit of `` Since I've Been Loving You'' _ a hit for <LOCATION> Led </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeppelin </LOCATION> in 1970. On stage, he puts some of <ORGANIZATION> Zep </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Custard Pie'' from the `` Physical Graffiti'' LP on the end of `` Tall Cool One.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zeppelin </ORGANIZATION> guitarist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> also plays on Plant's first single, `` Heaven Knows,'' and `` Tall Cool One,'' the current single. Plant co-wrote and sang `` The Only One'' on `` Outrider,'' the new album Page has after years of semi-retirment. `` I'm tipping my hat, looking back,'' Plant said in an interview. `` I've had kind of a mental block on that whole period. Now I have no problem with it at all. I think it was crucial to distance myself, just for my own integrity. I did n't know it was going to happen like this. I thought I would forever be a little reluctant and reticent but I see now that it's OK. `` I think this solo record is about the nearest I've got to succeeding on nearly all levels This is the most commercial and attractive. It's the happiest record I've made probably in my life.'' Most of the musical references to <LOCATION> Led </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeppelin </LOCATION> are on the fadeouts of tracks and they're done by a synthesizer briefly recreating the Zeppelin music. Plant said now is a good time to have a record out because there's a renewed interest in <LOCATION> Led </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeppelin </LOCATION>. `` I think the time seems to be appropriate right now,'' he said. `` That's all right by me. My father always tells me, ` Be thankful for all mercies.''' Plant's father was a civil engineer in <LOCATION> Bromwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Staffordshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where he was born almost 40 years ago. `` It's an interest in the music of the'70s, but we were from the'60s,'' Plant said. `` It's sad, really, because I thought somebody could have come up with something else by now. `` There are other things around. But there is also a lot of the Led Zeppelin thing about. It would be nice to get something with that kind of intent _ that thing, whatever it was that we had _ instead of all these impersonators trying to get somewhere near us and generally missing by a good mile.'' On `` Now and Zen,'' Plant has new partners: <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, two young songwriters whose publisher sent Plant a demo tape. `` I think the whole thing is a lot fresher,'' he said. `` It has been a revival for me within myself, never mind within the industry. `` I just wanted to get songs. Then I could see what could happen next. Of all the 100 or 120 tapes that had been sent me, I found this one little old baby cassette tape had got the very essence of what I wanted to do musically and what I've always felt that I represented musically. `` There it was in its virgin splendor, ` Heaven Knows,' with a girl singing it. Virgin Publishing sent it. It was sent by some astute lackey publisher's boy who knew that this was what everybody else did n't know. Most publishers are hawking anything they can, irrespective of whether it's the right thing for the job. `` It had some intrigue and some kind of mood that you do n't get on a pop record generally. You hear it sometimes on a <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> record,'' Plant said. `` I arranged a meeting with <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>. They arrived late enough to be cool but not to be aggressive. It was really good because they were arrogant and not impressed. `` From that meeting the three of us got together in <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s bedroom, set up the computers and started chattering our way through the first two songs that we wrote together <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> turned knobs and stuff while <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> and myself wrote ` White, Clean and Neat' and ` Tall Cool One.' That was in December 1986. A band was assembled by March 1987; final songs were written by the band, and recording started in May. Plant launched a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour in May. `` I think it's time to tour and tour and tour and tour and tour and play and celebrate this new thing and write the next album during the process of celebration.'' The group goes to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in September, and might extend the tour to the Orient and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Plant turns 40 on Aug. 20, and had these observations about his birthday: `` There's no deterioration anywhere particularly, a few visual marks, a few fenders may need a little bit of adjustment here and there. But the spirit and body and the man is doing fine so it's of no consequence. `` I know it sounds corny but basically I'm thrilled and I'm glad to be around.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: ``Love Story'' Author Finds Acclaim With
``Doctors''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> boy who went to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, taught classics at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and wrote `` Love Story,'' is still juggling serious and popular writing in a leafy corner of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He looks back on `` Love Story'' as a youthful Camelot, and senses that with his latest novel, `` Doctors,'' he may finally achieve the critical acclaim that has so far eluded him. At 51, he has temporarily given up the rigors of full-time university teaching but remains a fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wolfson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> An occasional sports commentator, he dreams of winning the over-60 category in the 1997 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> marathon. `` I am today a writer who is lucky enough to have academic privileges at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>,'' he says. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>'s fifth and most ambitious novel, `` Doctors,'' is the first that did not draw on his own life. Instead it chronicles members of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> class of 1962, which included several of his friends. He said he tried to tackle the subject of doctors and the pressures they face with the passion of `` Love Story,'' his first novel, and the scope of his last novel, `` The Class,'' a 25-year fictional follow-up of his fellow <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduates of 1958. `` For a long while I lived in gossip columns as <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> ` Love Story' Segal,'' he said in an interview. `` People would run up to me in airports and sing the first few bars of the tune from the movie version. It's not such a bad thing. If it had stopped there, I would have looked back on life as an athlete looks back ... and say I was there once.'' Instead, he moved on to such works as `` The Class'' and `` Doctors'' which, at 679 pages, is five times the length of `` Love Story.'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> remarks: `` Publishers used to worry that my books were too short. Now they're worrying that they're too long.'' He does n't feel he is an expatriate American writer. The academic world is the same everywhere, he said, and with satellite television and $ 168 fares to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is never far away. `` In this day and age, if I need something from the <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delicatessen </LOCATION>, there's always the Concorde,'' he said, `` and it never gets that bad.''. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, is English and when <PERSON> Francesca </PERSON>, their musically gifted 8-year-old daughter, started school, he decided it was unfair to keep commuting between <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. But he hates <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s weather and hopes to spend winters in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and teach there when <PERSON> Francesca </PERSON> becomes a teen-ager. Academics who have achieved popular success as writers include British philosopher <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> astronomer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Eco </PERSON>, a professor of semiotics. `` I only hope some day I'll reach the level of scholarship or literary respectability that they've achieved,'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said. `` It gives me a goal to shoot for.'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> speaks nine languages and has written a book on Roman comedy and more than 50 articles on Greek tragedy, Latin poetry and ancient athletics. But he has always found time to indulge his love of pop literature. He wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hasty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pudding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> show in 1958 and has written or co-written several screenplays including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatles </ORGANIZATION>' `` Yellow Submarine'' in 1968 `` Love Story,'' his bittersweet tale of youthful love and death which has sold more than 20 million copies in 33 languages since publication in 1970, turned the unknown professor into an international celebrity. The sequel, `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'s Story,'' a 1977 best seller, was followed by `` Man, Woman and Child.'' Although he was refused tenure at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 _ some say jealous colleagues disdained his success _ <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> kept teaching and writing. In 1981, he returned to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> as a full professor, though still without tenure, and retired in 1987. To critics who dismissed `` Love Story'' as fluff, he replies: `` Eighteen years later, when I find myself feeling guilty for all that success and thinking ` Love Story' was overrated, I pull out my Encyclopedia Britannica and see myself listed as writing in the tradition of the classic sentimental novelists, and then my ego relights. `` It was my little Camelot and it ca n't be taken away. It was my idyll. `` But fortunately, I got my second wind or second chance with ` The Class.' I had exhausted the possibilities of the sentimental novel and I got into the saga business, which has vastly more raw material.'' `` The Class,'' a 1985 best seller, was <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>'s first novel to receive modest critical acclaim, winning literary prizes in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` I actually thought ` The Class' was the end, because I'd written my life story into it, split apart,'' he said. He had qualms about writing `` Doctors,'' doubting his ability to enter their world. He spent two years attending medical congresses, talking to doctors and wandering through <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> weaing a white coat and a badge identifying him as Dr. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>. `` It says in little letters ` professor of Latin,' so I could walk the halls,'' said <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, who has a doctorate in comparative literature. Why doctors? `` Because they're very special,'' he said. `` They're the people we fear, need, love and hate the most. ... And they are answerable, so they think, only to God.'' He says he set out to write a diatribe against unscrupulous doctors, but met so many dedicated ones that he had to stop himself from going the other way. An insomniac, <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> normally works from 4 a.m. to 5 p.m. without leaving his desk. Then the slightly built athlete, who has completed over 40 marathons, goes for a swim or a run. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> says he is writing one more academic book, a history of classical comedy, but his next novel depends on what happens to `` Doctors.'' The first review, in Publishers Weekly, says the book addresses `` the gravest, most pressing issues facing doctors today and is <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>'s most skillfully written novel.'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, elated, says: `` That means I may be entering a phase of respectability which I've always dreamed of.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Hit Songs Hurt His Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Songwriter <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newbury </PERSON> says his career suffered because of two of his best-known compositions: `` American Trilogy'' and `` Just Dropped In -LRB- To See What Condition My Condition Was In -RRB-.'' Both songs, the 48-year-old writer-performer says, boxed him into uncomfortable stereotypes, either as a patriot or a rocker. `` American Trilogy'' was a hit by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> in 1973, and `` Just Dropped In'' was recorded by <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and the First Edition in 1968. `` American Trilogy,'' a medley of `` Dixie,'' `` Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and `` All My Trials,'' has been recorded or performed by dozens of artists. `` It stopped me in my tracks for a few years,'' <PERSON> Newbury </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The only thing I was getting asked to do was sing the national anthem at football games and I did n't like it.'' `` I did <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>'s Fourth of July show. You get a tag and it stuck.'' He says some people still come to his concerts to hear him perform it. `` Hopefully, if I can get them in to see me because of that song, they'll listen to something else I've done. It's the same problem everybody has. For <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, audiences come in to hear their funny stuff but they have a serious side.'' His reputation as a country music songwriter was undermined when `` Just Dropped In'' was taken as a song glorifying drug abuse. `` I was not taken seriously as a country songwriter for a while,'' he recalled. `` It hurt me because of the insanity of the music business. Everyone wanted to put you in a little pigeonhole. `` It was one of the first obvious anti-drug songs, yet it was so controversial that some said it was detrimental. It was about a bad acid trip. All the songs at that time were cloaked in metaphors espousing the glory of hallucinogens. They talked about how wonderful it was and how they open up your mind. It caused me to write it. I knew it was not that way for everyone. It put some people in the toilet.'' <PERSON> Newbury </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Vida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, has just released his 14th album, `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newbury </PERSON> in a New Age.'' It's his first LP since 1981 and a kind of greatest hits album. Yes, `` American Trilogy'' is on the disc, along with `` All My Trials,'' `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mabel Joy'' and others. During his career he's also written `` Sweet Memories,'' a hit by <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and `` She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye,'' which has been recorded by dozens of performers. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> are just two of the other singers who have recorded his songs. <PERSON> Newbury </PERSON> describes a good song as `` a good story. Something someone can relate to. A lot of songwriters get better as they get older, but they've already written about most of the interesting things in their life that happened when they were young and it was new. `` The whole process that drives you to write is to write that perfect song. No songwriter ever feels he's written that perfect song. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> did it already with ` Beautiful Dreamer' and yet when he died, he had a piece of paper in his pocket that said ` dear hearts and gentle people.' He had already started on another song. `` I think <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>'s song ` <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>' is a perfect song and I have not heard many perfect songs: ones so finely crafted that you say, ` I ca n't make a change.'''

 The walls of Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s relatively ordinary-looking office are lined with the pictures of dozens of babies he says are far from ordinary _ the products of the so-called Nobel Prize sperm bank `` This is our pride and joy and, by <PERSON> God </PERSON>, every one is a gem,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of the children born to mothers inseminated with `` superior'' sperm provided by his Repository for Germinal Choice. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 81, a multimillionaire who developed the shatterproof eyeglass lens, is on a mission to save the human species. Superior genes are being lost, he says, because society's smartest do n't have enough children while the masses proliferate with zeal <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> founded the bank in early 1980 and began collecting the sperm of a select few `` outstanding intellects'' and giving it to qualified couples, with the goal of bringing into the world potential leaders or great scientists. The bank claims responsibility for 55 babies, and 18 women are pregnant. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> says his program is working, that most of the children develop at a much faster rate than their peers and are judged gifted. Geneticists, however, still find fault, saying the program minimizes women's role in reproduction and exaggerates the likelihood children will inherit all their parents' good genes. But the proud parents cheer <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> for bringing them bright children they deserved but could n't have, usually because the father was infertile. `` I just wanted to have a child,'' said <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramm </PERSON>, a dancer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> whose daughter <PERSON> Leandra </PERSON> turned 4 on Wednesday. `` I believe that the donor sprem was from a man that seemed to be a great human being. We were increasing our chances of having a bright and healthy child.'' `` I ca n't imagine anyone would go there because they want a super baby,'' said a <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> mother who asked that her name not be used. `` It's just the best choice available for those who choose artificial insemination.'' When <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> opened his repository, critics ranging from feminists to communists and the Roman Catholic church denounced it as a `` master race'' plan reminiscent of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. The controversy was fueled by Nobel Prize winner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>'s revelation that he was a donor and by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s own views <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>, a physicist who invented the junction transistor, believed that certain races _ blacks for example _ were genetically disposed to be intellectually inferior. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, in his book `` The Future of Man,'' called man `` an evolutionary derelict'' because `` huge masses of those with ordinary minds have been allowed to come into being and then proliferate.'' Over time, artificial insemination became common, and more radical techniques, like in vitro insemination and gene mapping, took the spotlight in the reproductive industry. To <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s delight, protestors disappeared from outside his office about 30 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Capron </PERSON>, a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and former member of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Bio-ethics, has concerns with the repository, but gratefully notes `` it has n't become a major force in reproduction.'' `` I continue to think of it as a rather silly, misguided effort,'' <PERSON> Capron </PERSON> said. `` The whole notion of individuality and of uniqueness is what amounts to a genetic accident. `` The idea that you're going to get an ` Olympian' could lead to parents' frustrations when expectations are n't fulfilled.'' <PERSON> Capron </PERSON> also has ethical concerns. `` What does it say about a mother's contribution in reproduction? In it is the potential for a more eugenic society with somebody deciding what genes get passed along.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> counters that he neither promises nor expects the children to reach their fathers' levels of success or intellect, but says: `` We can with considerable assurance say we are contributing to the next generation by bringing a number of capable, constructive individuals, including leaders who would n't otherwise have been born, or ... would n't be as bright.'' The identities of donors, described by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> as `` tops in their field'' and `` outstanding intellects,'' are withheld from the parents and the public. The list includes two Nobelists and an Olympian. All are of European descent or Jewish, and most are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scientists. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> says he's invited blacks and Asians to donate, but that they've refused. Donors are declared of good health and genetic ancestry, which means their families are free of such diseases as alcoholism and mental illness, and the donated sperm is screened for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. Part of the AIDS screening includes a 180-day sperm quarantine. The sperm, stored in tanks of liquid nitrogen that keep it frozen, has been sent around the country and as far away as <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Applicant parents must show they are married, intelligent, emotionally and financially stable, with a clean physical and mental health history. The mother must be under age 38. About half the applicants are rejected. Parents choose a donor from such information as intelligence test score, ancestry, hair and eye color, athletic ability, hobbies, and personality traits. When they had <PERSON> Leandra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramm </PERSON> chose a fair-haired science professor of European roots described as loving gardening, skiing and children. For their second child, due next month, they chose the Olympic athlete. `` At first, I did feel inadequate and weird about the idea of using a donor,'' said <PERSON> Ramm </PERSON>, a computer systems manager who is infertile. `` But <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> really wanted a baby and that was fine by me. The only tough part is that since <PERSON> Leandra </PERSON> is so incredibly bright she's constantly exploring and challenging and into everything, which can be exhausting. `` But it's the price you pay for having such a bright baby.'' Most sperm banks provide limited screening and do n't allow parents to choose among donors, and the repository parents say it is the thorough medical check and quality of donors that draw them, not a desire for super children. Repository parents also acknowledge they promote their child's intellectual development and have high expectations, but say they are not unreasonable `` I do n't have flash cards around the crib since he was two weeks old, but I do expose <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> to as much as I can,'' the Riverside mother said. The 33-year-old woman and her 45-year-old second husband came to <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> because the husband had a vasectomy in an earlier marriage. Between them, they already had six other children from previous marriages. Although her other children are bright _ her two teen-age girls are honor students _ she says 1 -LCB- - year-old <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> is different: He requires little sleep for his age, only seven hours, is extremely inquisitive and loves books Her stories echo those of other repository parents, several of whom have come back for a second child, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> says. The children's `` vocabulary is often twice that expected They're standing early and walking young.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> requires annual reports from parents, but is frustrated that his experiment lacks rigid scientific standards because the donors and parents vary and the children are raised in different environments. But he added, `` The general consequences of bright, happy kids is good enough for me.''

<HEAD>Bizarre Child Abuse Disorder Probably Often Overlooked, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The boy's mother said he had cystic fibrosis, and so did the lab tests. But the real disease was far more bizarre. And it lay within the mother. No parent could have been more dedicated during the 5-year-old's hospitalizations She stayed with him around the clock and often helped the nurses giving him medications. But, doctors eventually realized, she also altered the boy's stool and perspiration samples to make them consistent with cystic fibrosis She tried to cast doubt on a normal test result by calling the hospital laboratory, giving a false name, and claiming the result was phony. And she tricked a real cystic fibrosis patient into giving her a sputum sample, then submitted the sample to doctors as her son's. Her case is an elaborate example of a psychiatric disorder called `` Munchausen syndrome by proxy,'' a variant of Munchausen syndrome, in which a person fakes disease just to get medical care. It is derived from <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>, an 18th century German who became well known for elaborate lies. In <LOCATION> Munchausen </LOCATION> by proxy, typically, a mother produces disease or the appearance of disease in her child, then acts like the model of a dedicated and concerned parent. The disorder is probably relatively rare, but `` we suspect it's more common than we think because it's so very difficult to recognize,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soutwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Besides, few doctors are comfortable with confronting a distraught mother who has just spent another sleepless night at the child's bedside and asking `` Are you doing something to that kid?,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadelson </PERSON>, chief of psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Some mothers have slipped their own blood into a child's mouth or urine samples. One was discovered giving a hospitalized infant an enema and putting the fluid in the child's mouth. Another was found to have been giving her child massive doses of a drug to force vomiting. The child died. Just what motivates such behavior is not well understood. It appears to be a way to signal distress, <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. And the parent `` gets a lot of reward from being seen as a wonderful, caring parent in her role as helping the child get good medical care.'' <PERSON> Nadelson </PERSON> sees it as a pathological expression of hostility against doctors and society. He considers it an addiction. `` People who do it once will do it again consistently. It's very exciting.'' Usually only one favored child is singled out for what the mother and child consider a game, he said. Treating the disorder is very difficult because people deny that they have the problem, <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. There have been anecdotal reports of some treatment successes, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, clinical instructor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Nadelson </PERSON> said he believes no treatment really works. Once a case is uncovered, the major goal is to protect the child, <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. That sometimes means a court-ordered change in custody. Most children involved in <LOCATION> Munchausen </LOCATION> by proxy are infants or toddlers, but they can occasionally be older children like the boy in the cystic fibrosis scam. Why do the older children go along with it? `` It's the only kind of love the child knows,'' <PERSON> Nadelson </PERSON> said. `` If it's love you're looking for, you'll take it under any circumstances.''

<HEAD>New Exercise Program Aims To Stop Decline In Fitness Of American
Youth</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new school exercise program that replaces competition with individual tests and health education could reverse the decline in fitness among American children while helping them avoid injury, experts say. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> is just starting to promote the program, called Fit Youth Today, or FYT, which was developed with the support of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fitness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It is state-of-the-art exercise science put into a workable form for educators,'' said <PERSON> Wiliam </PERSON> <PERSON> Squires </PERSON>, professor of health fitness and nutrition at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the task force that developed FYT. Unlike conventional school athletic programs, FYT does not favor naturally gifted athletes. It rewards each student for attaining his or her own fitness goals, whatever the level of athletic ability, said <PERSON> Squires </PERSON>. `` The FYT program represents a real departure from traditional fitness testing in this country,'' he said at a recent symposium here. It includes an educational curriculum intended to teach students about the importance of maintaining physical activity throughout life. Less than 50 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children have adequate heart-lung endurance, and 40 percent of those 5-8 years old have signs of elevated blood pressure, obesity or elevated cholesterol _ all of which increase the risk of heart disease, <PERSON> Squires </PERSON> said. `` The decline in youth fitness is real and is overwhelmingly supported by study after study.'' The consequences could be disastrous, he said, citing a study reported by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> last year that concluded lack of exercise was as strongly linked to heart disease as smoking, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In conventional programs, students are often measured against norms set by their peers. FYT conditions them not to run faster or jump higher than others but to be able to jog a set distance in 20 minutes, perform certain exercises demonstrating strength and flexibility, and reduce body fat specified levels. The key point is that the goals emphasize aerobic fitness, strength and weight loss _ not maximum performance, <PERSON> Squires </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Caspersen </PERSON>, an exercise physiologist and epidemiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said FYT's success will be measured by `` how well it motivates changes in behavior and guarantees an active lifestyle. `` It is the physical activity we're interest in, and if the testing encourages activity, that's what we're trying to achieve.'' FYT also is designed to avoid athletic injuries that can have more serious consequences in children than they do in adults. Children are unusually susceptible `` overuse injuries,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Micheli </PERSON>, an orthopedist and director of the Division of <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. These occur when joints and bones with soft growing surfaces are repeatedly subjected to small bumps and stresses, which may alone be painless but can add up to significant damage after prolonged exercise without proper training and conditioning. Children undergoing the adolescent growth spurt between about ages 12 and 14 become less flexible and are especially likely to suffer overuse injuries, <PERSON> Micheli </PERSON> said, adding coaches need to be trained to recognize subtle damage. He cited `` little-league elbow,'' in which children who are n't taught to throw properly can chip tiny flakes off their throwing elbow Ultimately, those chips grow into pebble-sized pieces that can cause excruciating pain _ and can end a young baseball player's season abruptly `` Is running good for kids? Absolutely,'' he said. `` Is too much running bad for kids? Absolutely. The question is how much is too much.''

<TEXT>
 The walls of Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s relatively ordinary-looking office are lined with the pictures of dozens of babies he says are far from ordinary _ the products of the so-called Nobel Prize sperm bank They are the children born to mothers inseminated with `` superior'' sperm provided by 8-year-old <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s Repository for Germinal Choice. The bank claims responsibility for 55 babies, and 18 women are pregnant. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 81, a multimillionaire who developed the shatterproof eyeglass lens, is on a mission to save the human species. Superior genes are being lost, he says, because society's smartest do n't have enough children while the masses proliferate with zeal He says his program is working, that most of the children develop at a much faster rate than their peers and are judged gifted. Geneticists, however, still find fault, saying the program minimizes women's role in reproduction and exaggerates the likelihood children will inherit all their parents' good genes. But the proud parents cheer <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> for bringing them bright children they deserved but could n't have, usually because the father was infertile. `` I just wanted to have a child,'' said <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramm </PERSON>, a dancer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> whose daughter <PERSON> Leandra </PERSON> turned 4 on Wednesday. `` I believe that the donor sprem was from a man that seemed to be a great human being. We were increasing our chances of having a bright and healthy child.'' When <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> opened his repository, critics ranging from feminists to communists and the Roman Catholic church denounced it as a `` master race'' plan reminiscent of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. The controversy was fueled by Nobel Prize winner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>'s revelation that he was a donor and by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s own views <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>, a physicist who invented the junction transistor, believed that certain races were genetically disposed to be intellectually inferior. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Capron </PERSON>, a former member of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Bio-ethics, has concerns with the repository, but gratefully notes `` it has n't become a major force in reproduction. The identities of <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s donors are withheld. The list includes two Nobelists and an Olympian. All are of European descent or Jewish, and most are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scientists. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> says blacks and Asians have refused to donate. Donors are declared of good health and genetic ancestry, and the sperm is screened for the AIDS virus. Applicant parents must show they are married, intelligent, emotionally and financially stable, with a clean physical and mental health history. The mother must be under age 38. About half the applicants are rejected. When they had <PERSON> Leandra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramm </PERSON> chose a fair-haired science professor of European roots described as loving gardening, skiing and children. For their second child, due next month, they chose the Olympic athlete. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> requires annual reports from parents, but is frustrated that his experiment lacks rigid scientific standards because the donors and parents vary and the children are raised in different environments. But he added, `` The general consequences of bright, happy kids is good enough for me.''

 The boy's mother said he had cystic fibrosis, and so did the lab tests. The real disease was more bizarre, and it lay within the mother. No parent could have been more dedicated during the 5-year-old's hospital stays She stayed with him around the clock and often helped nurses giving him medications. But doctors eventually realized she also altered his stool and perspiration samples to match cystic fibrosis symptoms. She even tried to cast doubt on a test result, and tricked a real cystic fibrosis patient into giving her a sputum sample, then submitted it to doctors. Her case is an elaborate example of a psychiatric disorder called `` Munchausen's syndrome by proxy,'' a variant of <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>'s syndrome, in which a person fakes disease to get medical care. In <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>'s by proxy, a mother typically produces disease or the appearance of disease in her child, then acts like the model of a dedicated and concerned parent. The disorder is probably relatively rare, but `` we suspect it's more common than we think because it's so very difficult to recognize,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soutwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Such behavior appears to be a way to signal distress, or hostility against doctors and society, experts say.

<HEAD>Contrast Agent Lets Magnetic Scan Detect Liver Cancer Sooner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A solution of iron oxide injected into a patient's veins can significantly improve the ability of magnetic scanning machines to pinpoint extremely small cancers of the liver, doctors say The development should make it possible to detect this kind of cancer early, when it can still be removed surgically, and to better determine how far it has progressed, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported in the August issue of the journal Radiology. Doctors using the technique administer the iron oxide then take a cross-sectional picture with a standard magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scanner. The iron oxide is absorbed by healthy cells but not by cancerous ones, making the cancers clearly stand out on magnetic pictures. Tests on 60 people showed that the technique could spot tumors as tiny as 3 millimeters, three times smaller can be found with other scanning methods. Whether liver cancer is treated with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation depends on the stage of the disease. `` Our purpose is to reduce some of the anguish of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery, as well as their cost, by accurate detection of metastases -LRB- spread -RRB- in the liver, which before now were too small to be visible early enough to appropriately stage the patient's disease prior to treatment,'' said Stark.

<HEAD>Altered Superconductor May Be Useful In Frictionless Bearings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Superconductors usually repel magnets, but new experiments show that with slight alterations they'll attract and hang suspended from magnets, raising the prospect of their use in frictionless bearings. The researchers added silver oxide to the traditional superconductor mixture of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen in pellets that they chilled in liquid nigrogen to make them superconducting. When they lowered a magnet toward a pellet, a `` supercurrent'' appeared on the pellet's surface that repelled the magnet. But when the magnet was pulled back, the weakening of the magnetic field affecting the pellet triggered another supercurrent that led to attraction toward the magnet. The attraction was strong enough to suspend the superconductor about half an inch below the magnet. It weakened if the magnet came closer than the half-inch and strengthened farther away, so the pellet hung at the half-inch gap. The suspension effect was reported by C.Y. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; M.K. Wu of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>; and P.N. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, in the June 13 issue of Applied Physics Letters. Further work has involved <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and others. They suggest that the work could lead to development of frictionless bearings. Experts unconnected with the studies said the effect may help in understanding superconductivity, but they doubted it had important practical applications. Superconductors can carry electricity with no resistance. Scientists hope they will help in developing more powerful computers, high-speed trains and other uses.

<HEAD>Sneezing After Sex Probably Not An Allergy, Doctor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 What sounds like an allergy to sex is more likely a reaction to a common nasal inflammation, a doctor says of a patient who sneezes repeatedly after intercourse. `` This is the most unusual problem I have ever been presented with by a patient,'' Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Clemson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, wrote in the question-and-answer section of last week's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The problem is probably due to vasomotor rhinitis, `` a fairly common syndrome'' in which the nasal passages are chronically inflamed, responded Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The condition is characterized by `` hyperactive'' or `` imbalanced'' control of certain nervous-system responses, <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said. Some nasal tissue is similar to that in the penis, so sexual arousal thus may cause swelling of the mucous membranes inside the nose, and an increase in nasal secretions, he said. Those symptoms likely trigger the sneezing attacks in Hunter's patient _ a 60-year-old man with a history of allergies _ because of the nervous system impairment brought on by the rhinitis, <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> wrote Those suffering from rhinitis frequently do n't respond to traditional treatment _ antihistimines and decongestants _ or complain of side effects, he wrote, suggesting intranasal use of a drug called ipratropium bromide if traditional treatment does n't work

<HEAD>New Corn Variety Packs Better Nutrition, Panel Says</HEAD>

 A new variety of corn provides higher quality protein than common types and could greatly help many of the world's undernourished people, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> committee says. The `` quality-protein maize'' looks and tastes like common corn but is nearly as good a protein source as skim milk, the committee said. Corn is a dietary staple for some 200 million people, including maybe half the world's undernourished population. In some parts of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, it is the primary or sole protein source for young children. But protein in traditional corn does not contain enough of two essential amino acids, lysine and tryptophan. So corn itself is not enough for acceptable growth and health, especially in children, the sick, and pregnant and lactating women, the council said in a statement. The new corn variety was developed at <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat. The committee report expressed confidence that it will be grown worldwide before the turn of the century.

<HEAD>Get Family History of Diseases to Assess Future Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People should be nosy about what <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> died of or what chronic diseases other relatives have had because it may reveal inherited hazards in the family, a genetics expert says. Questions about diseases in the family are not offensive if they are framed as requests to help future generations, and `` you really have an obligation to ask because it may be something that somebody other than you is at risk for,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, professor of medical genetics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. `` Older members have an obligation to pass along the information they have,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said after a recent science writers conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it's absolutely legitimate to ask for an autopsy report,'' which can reveal inherited conditions such as hemochromatosis, a buildup of iron in the tissues that can complicate other diseases, she added. For the family history, questions should focus on causes of death, chronic illnesses, reasons for hospitalization, long-term medication or chronic medical care before age 50, cancer before age 60, cancer in both breasts, diseases that killed more than one family member, and heart attacks or strokes before age 50. The information should be passed on to relatives and the family doctor. Every person carries five to eight genes that can increase the risk of disease in offspring if the other parent has a corresponding genetic defect, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. For example, one in 20 Caucasians carries the defective gene that causes cystic fibrosis; one in 10 blacks carries the sickle cell anemia gene. She also said half of all admissions to pediatric hospitals involve conditions with an inherited predisposition, such as kidney disease, cancer, diabetes and heart abnormalities.

 Business leaders have grown more confident about the economy, although they remain worried about a possible recession, according to a private survey. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business financed research group, said its business confidence index rose to 58 during the second quarter from 51 during the first three months of the year. The index released Sunday, compiled from a survey of about 1,000 of top executives, skidded to 47 in the last quarter of 1987, following the October stock market crash. The latest survey found an increase in confidence among executives in nine of the country's top 15 manufacturing industries and five of 10 leading non-manufacturing industries, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. Most of the survey respondents said `` the economy and their own industries are stronger now'' than before the crash, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Malin </PERSON>, senior economist for the business research group. `` But anxiety about rising inflation and interest rates continues to dampen enthusiasm about prospects for the second half of 1988,'' <PERSON> Malin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Mergers and acquisitions in the computer software and services industry heated up to record levels in the first half of 1988, according to a new survey. The number of deals rose 39 percent in comparison to the same period a year earlier, while the value of the deals shot up to $ 5.4 billion, more than twice as great as in the first half of 1987. The survey provided to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> is conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION>, N.J.-based investment banking firm, for <PERSON> Adapso </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based computer software and services industry association. The biggest deal of the half-year was <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.6 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> IMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a provider of market information for the health-care industry, <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> said That deal ranked as the second largest ever behind <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. There were 10 other deals for over $ 100 million, including one valued at $ 500 million in which a 50 percent share of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Apollo reservation system was bought by five airlines: <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION>, said the airline deal indicated the importance of controlling computer technology to `` attaining and maintaining an international competitive edge.'' Software and services companies are popular because they are rapidly growing, generate a lot of cash and have a stable base of revenue.

<HEAD>Dollar Holds Steady After Strong Opening; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar held steady against most major currencies in European trading today after intervention by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank dulled its strong opening, dealers said. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar rose in thin early dealings, with players in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> taking profits on the pound. But later they said intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> halted the dollar's rise, and at midmorning the market appeared to be taking a wait-and-see attitude. `` The market is rather indecisive right now,'' said one senior trader with a bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.7358, compared with $ 1.7405 Friday. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8360 West German marks, up from 1.8265; 1.5266 Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 6.1920 French francs, up from 6.1630; 2.0710 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0615; 1,357.50 Italian lire, up from 1,353.75; and 1.2030 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 131.80. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 131.65 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 442.60 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 442. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 442.20 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 442.50, unchanged from $ 442.50 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid price of $ 444.28, compared to Saturday's $ 444.62 and late Friday's $ 444.86 closing. Later, silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 7.56 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 7.76.

 Stock prices fell Monday amid bargain-hunting in light trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 9.5 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,835.3 at midday, after having fallen 18 points in early trading. Volume was 169.1 million shares, compared to 233.1 million shares at the same time Friday. The early declines came on the back of a strong pound and poor performances in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday and in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> earlier Monday. Some traders said they were encouraged that the market found the energy to recover some ground. `` It has n't been all that bad,'' said one trader. The lows created `` a good buying opportunity'' in some stocks, he said. But the buying enthusiasm which lifted stocks was n't expected to carry into the afternoon, traders said. They said they expected the market to drift. `` I do n't think there's any great excitement,'' a trader said.

<HEAD>Pillsbury To Buy Bumble Bee Seafoods, Divest Grain Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has signed a definitive agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Bumble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafoods </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held producer of canned tuna and other seafood. Terms of the agreement were not announced, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said in a prepared statement. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement came three days after H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its agreement to acquire Bumble Bee had been terminated because the federal government was trying to block the deal on antitrust grounds. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> also said Monday it intends to divest its Minneapolis-based grain merchandising division, which operates grain handling and storage facilities primarily in the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The company said it expects to identify a buyer within the next few months. Proceeds from the sale of the grain merchandising division and other sources of internal funding are expected to cover a major portion of the costs associated with the Bumble Bee acquisition, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said. Although grain merchandising has been quite profitable, the company has indicated the division is not part of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term strategic plans, according to the statement `` Today's announcements represent a continuation of our commitment to quality, branded products with unique strengths that provide new growth opportunities for the future,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` We expect Bumble Bee to be a positive contributor to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings in the first year of operation,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> added. Bumble Bee will continue to operate under its current management as a wholly owned subsidiary with headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s statement. Bumble Bee, with 1987 sales of $ 265 million, is a top seller of white meat, or albacore, tuna and canned salmon. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, an international food and restaurant organization with fiscal 1988 sales of $ 6.2 billion, includes the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s frozen seafood line which it acquired in 1984 Among the company's other brand names are <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION>, Haagen-Dazs, Burger King, Steak and Ale, and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s

<HEAD>Price Supports, Import Quotas Keep U.S. Sugar Costs High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government sugar policy can be sweet for domestic producers who enjoy high price supports, or bitter for foreign sugar-producing countries whose access to the American market is limited by strict quotas, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says. `` Although fewer than 1 percent of American farmers grow sugar cane or sugar beets, the commodity is one of the most heavily protected by price supports and import quotas,'' the report said. Those in favor of current policy say federal protection is necessary for the survival of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar industry. Without it, they say it would be impossible for American growers to compete with cheaper sugar from countries that have much lower production costs. Another argument is that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn industry also benefits from higher sugar prices by boosting demand for <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION>, or high fructose corn syrup, in soft drinks and many other food products. But <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts say the other side of the coin includes higher retail prices for American sugar consumers and lost sales _ because of import quotas _ for some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies who depend greatly on sugar as an export commodity. Sugar crops are supported at the equivalent of 18 cents per pound of raw sugar equivalent through `` non-recourse'' loans made by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It means that if market prices fall below the loan rate, sugar processors can forfeit their collateral without penalty. In that case, the loan obligation is canceled and the CCC takes over ownership of the foreclosed sugar and holds it as surplus. To minimize the risk of forfeiture and to head off large rises in CCC holdings, the market price must be high enough to cover the loan rate, plus interest, plus marketing charges. The desired price is called the Market Stabilization Price, or MSP. For 1987-88, the <ORGANIZATION> MSP </ORGANIZATION> is 21.76 cents per pound. In the first quarter of this year, the duty-paid price of raw sugar delivered to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> averaged 22.03 cents per pound, well above the MSP. Comparatively, the `` world price'' of sugar, based on <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> shipping points, was less than 10 cents per pound. To prevent lower-priced foreign sugar from pulling down the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic price, import quotas allocated to specific countries have been set each year since 1982. The quotas keep the supply tight enough to maintain prices near the <ORGANIZATION> MSP </ORGANIZATION>, says economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the estimates of supply and demand are accurate, domestic sugar prices stay high enough to prevent loan forfeitures,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> writes in the forthcoming August issue of Farmline magazine. `` A loan forfeiture presents a surplus and storage problem for the CCC.'' Federal law stipulates that the sugar price support program is to be operated at no net cost to the taxpayers. The cost of the program is basically paid for by American consumers through higher prices for table sugar and products that contain sugar, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. Who benefits? Growers and processing companies, who are guaranteed the support price. Also, indirectly, the corn sweetener industry, which has seen <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> become the dominant sweetener for soft drink manufacturers, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. Glucose and dextrose, also made from corn, for many years had held about 17 percent of the calorie-type sweetener market. But when the new liquid <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> came along, it became the major caloric sweetener used in soft drinks. In 1988, per capita consumption of <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> is forecast at 69.5 pounds per American, 10 percent more than the average for sugar. Foreign manufacturers of products containing sugar, and American consumers of certain imported gourmet food items made from lower-cost foreign sugar, also benefit from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said, the price support program has encouraged greater <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic sugar production, thereby reducing import requirements, adding to the world export surplus and keeping world prices low. Sugar-importing nations also benefit, he said. By encouraging surpluses and low world sugar prices, the support program of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some other countries `` create a windfall'' for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the major sugar importers. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said the program also has an effect on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment. When import quotas shrink, refineries close because they have less foreign raw sugar to process. Since 1982, eight plants have closed, eliminating more than 7,000 jobs, he said. And additional jobs are lost when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers of sugar-containing products reduce output. The highest cost of the sugar program is paid indirectly by sugar exporters, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. For years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the largest importer, with foreign shipments reaching a peak of 6.1 million tons in 1977 and averaging 4.2 million tons a year from 1975 to 1981. In 1988, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar import quota initially was about 750,000 tons but was increased Friday to 1.06 million tons. Several bills in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would alter the sugar program. One would reduce the support price to 12 cents per pound from the current level of 18 cents over a period of four crop years. Also, the import quota would be increased by 500,000 tons a year for four years, beginning in 1989. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said that the lower support `` should lower market prices, and this would probably discourage production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and increase the demand for imported sugar.''

<HEAD>Exxon Reports Second-Quarter Earnings Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest oil company, today reported a 4 percent increase in second-quarter net income as higher refining and chemicals earnings offset lower exploration and production results. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, up from net income of $ 1.15 billion, or 81 cents a share in the second quarter of 1987. Revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to $ 21.63 billion from $ 20.16 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.G. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> noted that `` margins were stronger as supply costs dropped and product prices firmed'' during the quarter. He also said increased demand for petroleum products boosted sales volume in both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. Earnings from exploration and production operations totaled $ 703 million, $ 183 million less than the year-ago period. The company noted that lower crude oil sales to its own refineries as well as to outside customers coupled with higher expenses to offset increased crude production from new and expanded oil fields. The company's chemicals operation reported an $ 89 million increase in earnings to $ 314 million, while higher copper prices helped the coal and minerals unit report net income of $ 8 million, compared with a $ 14 million loss a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> reported corporate and financing charges of $ 172 million, up from $ 24 million a year go. For the first six months, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 2.66 billion, or $ 1.96 a share, up 20 percent from $ 2.22 billion, or $ 1.56 a share in the first half of 1987. Revenue during the period totaled $ 43.63 billion, up 10 percent from revenue of $ 39.6 billion in the year-ago period.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The five-member <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pricing committee has decided in principle to meet Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, primarily to deal with a decision by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to increase its oil production, a newsletter reported Monday. The respected <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> said the committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> is `` expected to go through the formal motions of reviewing the market situation.'' But it said `` the main topic on the agenda will be the U.A.E.'s unilateral decision to allocate itself an ` official' quota of 1.5 million barrels a day'' and the impact of this on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production quota and the market. There has been no official announcement of the meeting of the committee, comprisng oil ministers of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. A final decision on the meeting may depend on the visit of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> U.A.E. </ORGANIZATION>, the newsletter said. He is expected there later this week after finishing the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The Middle East Economic Survey said Dr. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> faces a difficult task because the U.A.E.'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decided July 18 to increase production to 1.5 million barrels a day. The U.A.E.'s OPEC-set production quota is 948,000 barrels a day. Crude oil prices have fallen below the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel, even without the increase in production by the <ORGANIZATION> U.A.E. </ORGANIZATION>, largely because of increased non-OPEC production and above-quota production by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. To enforce the $ 18 price, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> alloted each of its members a quota with total <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production set at 15 million barrels a day. This excludes <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> which refused its allotted quota of 1.54 million barrels a day and has insisted on a quota equal to that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, its <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war opponent, or 2.37 million barrels a day. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been producing at a level of about 2.7 million barrels a day.

The tire-maker said it earned $ 134.9 million, or $ 2.35 a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with a profit of $ 141 million, or $ 2.47 a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue rose 10.3 percent to $ 2.79 billion from $ 2.53 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 results included $ 13.6 million from the sale of its plant in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and some properties in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> along with the abandonment of a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Toyobo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perduyn </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Soybeans, Corn Futures Plummet In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn and soybean futures plunged their permitted limits in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to scattered showers over the weekend and forecasts for rain today in the eastern <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Crop futures opened slightly lower, then plummeted after the November soybean contract slipped below last week's low of $ 8.15 a bushel, analysts said. The limit losses of 10 cents a bushel for corn and 30 cents a bushel for soybeans suggested soybean futures may extend to six days the sharp decline that began a week ago. Crop experts say the recent <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> rains have been too spotty to cause great improvement in the drought-damaged corn and soybean crops `` but the market's perception is that the situation is much better than it was,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Certainly, the markets are reflecting a concern that the crop is making a major recovery,'' he said. In early trading, wheat was 7 cents to 13 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.71 a bushel; corn was 8 -RCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 3.02 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to the limit 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.50 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 11 -LCB- cents to 30 cents lower with August at $ 8.00 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .45 cent higher with August at 65.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent lower to .18 cent higher with August at 77.00 cents a pound; hogs were .62 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent lower to .03 cent higher with August at 37.80 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while pork futures were mixed.

 At the research and development offices of these automakers, pushing a test car to the limits means giving it a good shove around a 20-foot plastic proving ground. In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> toy car industry, <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> is one of the Big Three. Last year, the <LOCATION> Moonachie </LOCATION>, N.J.-based company sold 77 million vehicles _ more than <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> put together. The other members of the tiny Big Three _ <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Hot Wheels, and the upstart <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galoob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, are heavy hitters in a business devoid of controversy and lawsuits. `` We've never had a recall, we have no smog problems, no safety problems,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION>'s top designer of Hot Wheels cars. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> spent three years designing cars for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, in the 1960s before joining the <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> and downsizing his designs for the pint-size customer. `` When I worked in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, I did a few door handles and tail lights. So far, I've done every Hot Wheels car since 1968,'' he said. These days, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> is designing Hot Wheels' 1990 line, trying to anticipate the car buyers' desires nearly as far into the future as <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> automakers. `` I think they have gone a little more conservative in the last few years. Now kids seem to like the standard sporty cars,'' he said. To anticipate designs, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> sifts through automotive trade magazines that often offer an advance peek of what <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> plan to offer in upcoming model years. `` If <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> come out with an exciting car or different profile, we take a look at it,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Matchbox was so taken by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Taurus-Sable design, that it copied the new-age look for its 1-64 scale die-cast miniatures. `` If we see a trend developing in auto design, we will stay with the trend and capture it in our cars,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, Matchbox marketing director. `` Obviously, the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taurus </ORGANIZATION> is a pretty sleek design and its something that's caught on with the public.'' In September, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> will offer toy cars that change color in the sun. The new option strays slightly from <LOCATION> Galoob </LOCATION>'s philosophy of keeping its Micro Machines realistic. `` Kids are not crazy for fantasy,'' marketing manager <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want a car that does n't look like a car. Kids today are very sophisticated. They know what a -LRB- <LOCATION> Lamborghini </LOCATION> -RRB- Countache is and what a Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> is.'' <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> expects to sell 45 million vehicles in 1988, just its second year in the market. Its Micro Machines are about 1 \ inches long, smaller than Hot Wheels or Matchboxes, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said Sports cars and military and construction vehicles are the hot sellers among the rug-running set. `` Basically, kids like things that are power oriented. The feeling of speed or power is what kids gravitate to,'' said <PERSON> Matchbox </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. Adults and children apparently split the purchases evenly, said <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION>'s Wood, with children often choosing what they see on television. For instance, a miniature version of the white Ferrari Testarossa driven in `` Miami Vice'' is one of the most popular toy sellers. The children show some loyalty toward American-made cars, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says, because that's what they often see on the streets. That loyalty can carry over into their adulthood, he said. `` If they happen to like four-wheel-drive cars as a kid, there's a strong possibility they'll like four-wheel vehicles as an adult,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said `` In my opinion, if you like a particular type of car as a kid, you're apt to grow up and like them.'' That's good news for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> automakers, who usually charge no royalties to miniature automakers who replicate their cars. `` Anytime you get your product in the mind of the car buyer or a young person, you enhance your reputation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>. `` We think it does a lot of good. You get involved in a lot of shelf space in department stores. It also gets young people involved in your product. The bottom line is consideration of your product.'' When <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> introduced its Caravan and Voyager minivans, it passed out Matchbox versions to the press as souvenirs, <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials review miniatures modeled after their cars to make sure they measure up. `` We want it -LRB- a toy -RRB- to be very authentic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> said. `` We want it to be accurate in every detail. We consider this child a future car buyer.'' And while children are the primary market, collectors also make up small fragment of their sales. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says there are about 20,000 Matchbox collectors in the country, who trade and sell vehicles, some worth up to $ 200 each. Overall, the miniature car industry is cruising steadily. `` This is a field that is growing. But do not expect dramatic growth from one year to the next,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibowitz </PERSON>, a toy industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The cars usually take nine months to get from the drawing board to production, which is usually performed at mini assembly lines in the Orient, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Before they reach full production, the miniature car makers often have groups of kids rate them and describe what they like about a particular model. If a vehicle makes the grade, it's down to the test track, where executives can briefly escape the pressures of business and test ride their product. `` We have little tracks down in -LRB- research and development -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Matchbox </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` It's a plastic track. We shoot them around and have fun with them.''

 When he was about 12 years old, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> figured he was too old to play with toy cars. When he turned 28, he realized maybe he was n't. The 38-year-old <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> is one of about 6,000 members worldwide of Matchbox toy car collectors groups. The members trade, buy and sell the small-scale replicas of vehicles ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testarossa </ORGANIZATION> to a <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> earth mover. `` If you do it right, you can probably accumulate a little bit of wealth,'' said <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a high school teacher. `` My mom and my wife are working for me at rummage sales. I have a network of people working for me,'' he said. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> figures the most valuable piece in the 700-vehicle collection is worth about $ 50. `` I'd categorize -LRB- the collection -RRB- in the infant stages based on what I've seen at the shows,'' he said. The smallest Matchbox cars sell for about $ 1.10 in hobby stores. Each year, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> says he acquires <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION>'s new line of cars, usually about 12, and a few older models missing from his collection. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collectors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. The 900 club members receive the organization magazine every two months and meet annually. `` You get all types.

 For <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Puryear </PERSON>, the road to joining the <ORGANIZATION> Rothschilds </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Gallos </ORGANIZATION> began with a batch of homemade plum wine. The home brew _ made with directions from a $ 1.99 book, a five-gallon jug and some plastic tubing _ was terrible, said the co-owner of the award-winning Bonair Winery. Things have improved quite a bit since then, and the Puryears are among several small family winemakers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who compete for shelf space and medals with corporate giants like Chateau Ste. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>, the state's largest. `` It's so much fun and so romantic,'' <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puryear </PERSON>, a former social worker in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said recently. `` This has surpassed my wildest dreams.'' Some of the family winemakers are hobbyists that barely break even, but others are trying hard to make a living at it. `` The glamour fades fast once you get into the business,'' admitted <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, owner of Horizon's Edge Winery in <LOCATION> Zillah </LOCATION>, nestled in the rolling countryside near <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Start-up costs for small wineries average about $ 270,000, and competition is fierce for supermarket and wine list space. About seven of the state's 70 wineries produce under 2,083 cases, or 5,000 gallons, per year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Most of those under 5,000 gallons are family wineries, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegl </PERSON>, director of the trade By contrast, giants like Chateau Ste. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> produce about 500,000 cases per year and enjoy national distribution. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the nation's third largest winemaker, after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but is far behind <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 700 wineries. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> winemakers have a history of cooperation, spurring a growth from 11 wineries in 1977 to the present 70. The roots of many wineries are intertwined. For instance, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Latah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellars </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, originally moved up from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to help open <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Winery Then he helped start <PERSON> Hogue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cellars </PERSON> of <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> before securing financial help from the Hogues to launch <LOCATION> Latah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in 1983. `` The financial help was in exchange for my winemaking at <ORGANIZATION> Hogue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellars </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, whose winery produces 15,000 cases a year. There are many similar stories, because it's an expensive business to get into. `` It's a good way to make a small fortune out of a large one,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who also owns <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winery </ORGANIZATION>, the only one in that state. `` If your total end is to make money, this is not the business to be in,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, one of several alumni of the winemaking program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Davis </ORGANIZATION> who operate in the state. Horizon's Edge, which opened in 1985 and produces 2,500 cases a year, is approaching $ 100,000 in annual sales, he said. `` I could make more money on the capital in CDs,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> has also worked for Chateau Ste. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stewart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vineyards </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tucker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellars </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sunnyside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Blackwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I decided I better carve a niche for myself while I still could,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, Mont. Like most of the small wineries, his major market is in state, with many of the sales to visitors in the tasting room. `` Everyone who comes through is having fun,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Puryear </PERSON> of the often raucous mix of visitors to <PERSON> Bonair </PERSON>'s tiny tasting room. `` It's not like buying asparagus at <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>.'' The tasting room is an important fixture in the small wineries, because up to 80 percent of the product is sold there _ especially by those that do not have wide distribution. `` We get hundreds of people per week here in the summer,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Puryear </PERSON> said, even though the room can hold less than a dozen at one time. `` We get people in here who own wineries in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or a local who drops by carrying a can of beer,'' she said. Her tasting room has maps of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the world, with pins showing the states and countries of visitors. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> is the only state without a pin. `` The first person from <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> will get a bottle of free wine,'' she said. `` Our choice.'' Owners of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s family wineries, some of which produce considerably more than 5,000 gallons, come from a variety of backgrounds. For instance: _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, owners of <LOCATION> Kiona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vineyards </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, are engineers on the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation, a federal plutonium-making facility _ <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Staton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and a pioneer in wine exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, founded the <PERSON> Wapato </PERSON> winery a decade ago after working as an attorney and as an executive for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Manz </PERSON>, a child psychiatrist and teacher, respectively, began Mountain Dome Winery in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> four years ago They make champagne exclusively and do n't plan to market any of their product until 1992. _ Dr <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sunnyside </LOCATION> established <ORGANIZATION> Stewart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vineyards </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. Ray Small of <PERSON> Walla </PERSON> <PERSON> Walla </PERSON>, half owner of the highly-regarded <ORGANIZATION> Woodward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winery </ORGANIZATION>, says winemaking is more profitable than raising hogs. Small put up the money when his son, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, wanted to go into winemaking in 1981 and they produce up to 8,000 gallons per year. The winery is actually a metal building on their farm that originally served as a truck garage and paint shop, he said. `` We've got four or five operations here and some of them are hurting pretty good, like the wheat business and the hog business,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. But the winery is `` in the black.'' Winemaking has an attractive, sophisticated image, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> owners say the life is n't quite like `` Falcon Crest,'' the television series about intrigues in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s wine country. `` Everybody asks about -LRB- <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Puryear </PERSON>. `` I watched one episode and they stuck a body in a wine tank. `` It's not like <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION>,'' she said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the information services group, said Monday its half-year net profit rose 24.3 percent over a year ago as its financial information and dealing services continued to grow vigorously. However, revenue from trading room systems fell sharply as investment companies implemented sharp cutbacks, <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> said its net profit for the six months ended June 30 came to 63.4 million pounds, or $ 108.4 million, or 15.1 pence a share, compared with 51 million pounds, or 12.2 pence a share, in the same period a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> said its revenue rose 17.7 percent to 471.4 million pounds from 400.4 million pounds. The company did not give out quarterly results. It is not required to release them under British law. The company, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency, said revenue growth was curbed by the strength of the pound and a decline in contributions from trading room systems. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfrew </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>' managing director and chief executive, said a slowdown in orders for trading room systems was mostly the result of cutbacks in investment firms in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 The stock market gave ground today, extending last week's decline. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 68.46 points last week, lost another 3.56 to 2,057.43 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 515 up, 749 down and 502 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 140.57 million shares at noontime, against 82.44 million at the same point Friday. More than half that activity came in just two issues _ <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 22 -RCB-, and <LOCATION> Pinnacle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, unchanged at 25. Analysts said both were the targets of large-scale trading strategies based on the companies' impending dividend payments. Otherwise, brokers said traders were still put off by worries over inflation and fears of a continuing rise in interest rates. The government is due to report Wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter. If the figures show persistent strong growth in business activity, as many analysts expect, they could raise fresh fears of upward pressure on interest rates. In addition, brokers said, morale on Wall Street was generally low after the market's weak performance last week. Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, down | at 50 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 41 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 88. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 59 -RRB- in active trading.

<HEAD>Rubik's Cube Creator Launches A New Invention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Hungarian professor who frustrated millions with his `` Rubik's Cube'' is introducing his latest mind-twister _ a puzzle he says even he has n't even solved, a spokeswoman for the toy company marketing the product said Monday. But <PERSON> Erno </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubik </PERSON>'s failure has not arisen from a lack of ability, merely a lack of time to puzzle out the secrets of Rubik's Clock, said <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` Really, it's not because it's impossible, he's just too busy to take the time to do it,'' she said, adding that the new toy will be launched at a major <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> toy store Saturday. Rubik, 44, a professor of architecture and design at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crafts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, invented the mult-colored Rubik's Cube as a teaching aid After the success of the cube, which sold over 120 million units worldwide, he founded a private business, Rubik's Studio, in conjunction with the Hungarian government. The studio has produced Rubik's <ORGANIZATION> Magic </ORGANIZATION>, another toy puzzle, and a series of products with business applications. His new toy requires a player to get 18 clocks on both sides of a plastic disc to strike midnight simultaneously by twisting wheels which turn some of the hands but not others, according to Ms. <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>. Speaking of his latest invention, Rubik warned in a press release: `` Do n't cheat by being taught how to do it by someone else. It is much more satisfying to decode the puzzle on your own.'' `` It is important to remember that your brain needs to be kept in shape ... my new puzzle can help because it enables you to focus entirely on finding the formula which, although it may seem frustrating at the time, will do you good,'' he added. Rubik's Clock will retail for about $ 12, Ms. <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> signed a contract Monday covering workers affected by the scheduled end of auto production in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> and the closing of the stamping plant in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> vice president and director of its <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> department, said he hoped there would be `` life after current production'' which is scheduled to end in December at the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>. `` We hope this will not be the end of this operation. It is our hope that it does continue,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. The agreement covers 5,500 workers in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> and 450 at the stamping plant, which already has closed. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said he was particularly happy about the commitment in the contract calling for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to pay back AMC profit-sharing that <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> had promised members of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> locals 72 and 75 in exchange for concessions. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> acquired the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> car-making plant and the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> stamping operation when it bought <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> initially planned to keep the plant open for several years, but then announced it did not need the production capability. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, vice president for human resources at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, also cited provisions in the pact calling for worker benefits to continue for up to two years after the layoffs and to allow special early retirements for some senior workers. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the decision to stop building cars in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> as of December stands. When asked if there was any chance of it continuing into 1989, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said, `` I would suggest that the answer is no to that.'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the company projects that the produced in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> at a separate plant that employs about 800 workers will be needed through 1992. But he said it is possible that plant could close before that. `` However, it certainly is not likely,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A think tank has been given 10 months to answer a question that has concerned consumers and plagued philatelists since the dawn of postal automation: Why wo n't stamps stick? <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which recently received a $ 700,000 contract from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service, convenes a meeting here Thursday in hopes of making a sticky situation stickier, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, general manager of the stamp division of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. About 100 representatives of adhesive manufacturers and paper companies expected to attend the one-day meeting will be asked to share their thoughts and, in some cases, their secret formulas. `` I do n't think $ 700,000 is too much to pay for a stamp that sticks,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` Compare that to the fact that stamps are an $ 8 billion-a-year business.'' The Columbus-based institute is trying to find a perfect stamp glue _ one that not only will keep stamp and envelope together from the point of origin to destination, but will taste a little better, <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. `` The public insists that it at least, if it ca n't stick, not taste so bad,'' he said. `` The problem is finding a consensus on what tastes good. Some people like liver, others do n't. So it's got to be something that may not taste great, and may not taste like anything at all.'' He said consumers have repeatedly suggested more flavorful glues that taste like cherry, vanilla and vodka. `` Oh, they have suggested it, but I hardly think vodka would be appropriate,'' he said, laughing. `` No, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, we're not planning on that at all.'' Neither <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> consider the issue a laughing matter. `` Sure, people giggle. But it's not very funny to us. It's very important to us, and to the people who want their letters to reach their destinations,'' <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON>'s task will not be easy. `` Do you have any idea how many adhesives there are in the world?'' he said. The Postal Service uses three kinds of adhesives now, which <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> describes as `` shiny, not shiny and halfway in between.'' He could not estimate how many stamps are lost in transit every year, but said the problem has gotten worse since the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> began to automate in the early 1970s. `` Before then, when it was manual, the impact to a stamp was like a car hitting a brick wall at 5 mph. Now, it's like a car hitting a brick wall at 60 mph. Because these machines accelerate and decelerate so fast, when the envelope stops, the stamp does n't want to,'' he said Slowing the machines wo n't fix the problem, he said. The rising volume of mailed items means the system will have to speed up. About 35 million stamped items move through the system every year. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philatelic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of stamp collectors, has argued that not only is the adhesive not sticky enough, it also eats through the paper, which decreases a stamp's value One philatelist does not agree that a new glue is needed. M.W. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Topical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philatelic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> says the glue is not the culprit. He blames the disappearing stamp dilemma on human error and sorting machines that are not stamp-friendly. `` I'm in this business 40 years and I just do n't see the non-sticky problem. If they fall off sometimes, it's not the glue. People are n't licking them enough, the envelope maybe has some dust on it. I think the real problem is the machines at the post office,'' he said.

<HEAD>Japanese Beginning to Spend their Yen on Luxury Goods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Japanese are breaking with a tradition of frugality to bring some luxury into their lives _ big cars, European furniture, diamond jewelry. The government has been urging them to spend the yen they ordinarily put in the bank, in hopes of spurring the domestic economy. Analysts say skyrocketing property values, easy credit, price stability and the yen's rise in value are generating a fast-growing market for luxury goods _ a turnaround from three years of slumping consumption when the surging yen subdued the export-driven economy. `` Selling well are expensive and luxurious durable goods such as large-size TV sets, refrigerators, furniture and dining ware imported from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirose </PERSON> of the Sales Promotion Division at <ORGANIZATION> Matsuya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major department store on <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s bustling <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION>. A recent <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> report called brisk personal buying a `` key element'' of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current economic success. The government has cut income taxes and launched a 5-trillion-yen -LRB- $ 40 billion -RRB- public spending program, spurring housing starts. The bank cut its discount rate to a record low 2.5 percent, and the public <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> trimmed more than a percentage point off its interest rate, currently 4.35 percent. Consumer demand as measured by department store sales jumped 8.2 percent in April from a year earlier, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Total sales by 254 major department stores last year rose an average 4.7 percent every month, the association said. And the gross national product, which measures total output of goods and services, grew at an annualized rate of 11.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> indicate. `` People regard expensive, new products as a means of being somewhat different from others,'' said <PERSON> Takayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, manager of the Consumer Electronics Product Division at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In 1985 the company began marketing its 37-inch color television set, the industry equivalent of 35-inch American models, for 478,000 yen -LRB- $ 3,825 -RRB-. `` At first we never thought a large-sized TV with a built-in picture tube would be accepted in Japanese homes, which some Europeans have ridiculed as ` rabbit hutches','' <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> said in an interview, `` but the opposite is true. People have realized that the larger the TV screen, the more fun they can have, the more feeling of real ambience.'' Japanese bought 9.6 million color TV sets last year, 20 percent of which measured 22 inches or larger, up 12 percent from 1986, according to industry figures. Automakers are benefiting from the Japanese who now want bigger, more expensive cars. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in April sold 14,673 of its large-size, 4.6-million-yen -LRB- $ 37,000 -RRB-, top-of-the-line Crown models _ a 92.5-percent jump from a year earlier. `` People's sense of money has become accentuated,'' said <PERSON> Isao </PERSON> <PERSON> Takayama </PERSON>, chief of the jewelry division at the swank <ORGANIZATION> Mitsukoshi </ORGANIZATION> department stores. `` Several years ago you could buy a house for 50 to 60 million yen. Now it costs up to 500 million yen -LRB- $ 4 million -RRB-. It tends to dull people's sense of money.'' Reflecting a demand for expensive ornaments, imports of polished diamonds rose 61.6 percent to 1.06 million carats in the first four months of this year over last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Takayama </PERSON> said the hottest items are diamond rings priced at 2 million yen -LRB- $ 16,000 -RRB-. `` Nowadays customers come in asking to see diamonds of about 100 million yen -LRB- $ 228,000 -RRB-,'' he said. `` Four or five years ago, that was the stuff of dreams.''

 Prices fell Monday in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market awaited British economic reports due later in the week. The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 6.3 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,838.5, after sinking as low as 1,826.7 shortly after the opening. Volume was a meager 288.4 million shares, compared with 402.6 million shares traded Friday. Some traders said they were encouraged by the market's ability to claw back from its initial decline of 18.1 points. The early declines came as the pound strengthened and stock prices had fallen Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and earlier Monday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We're ticking a bit better all the time,'' one equity salesman said. But there was little news on which the market could trade, traders said.

<TEXT>
 Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> opened last Tuesday, grim-faced Japanese businessmen began filing into the lobby of <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION> shopping district to track the market's performance Their faces grew grim as a retreat that began the previous day in response to a jump in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar's value quickly turned into a rout. Before it was over, the market's barometer, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, had lost 513.09 points, its biggest loss of the year. After a brief rebound at mid-week, the decline resumed, stripping more than 600 points from the average by week's end. On Monday, the market rose 76.55 points at the opening bell, then slumped again to finish down 117.81 at 27,183.53. While the declines pale in comparison to the calamitous plunge of last October when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> markets set off a worldwide stock market panic, they are worrisome nonetheless. Some Japanese economists view the latest decline as a warning shot for the high-flying Japanese economy, and they caution that the next `` Black Monday'' could be precipitated here. `` I think these are continuing signs of confusion over the direction of the economy in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` These are warning signals, and people are nervous.'' Market analysts blamed the wave of selling on market shifts, from steel and shipbuilding shares to electronics. <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said investors are trying to take their money into more stable stocks, so they have a better chance of selling if the market falls. `` When people have their eyes on the fire exit, they buy those stocks,'' he said. The root of the concern appears to be the recent surge in the dollar's value, which has moved above the psychologically important level of 130 yen after a long decline. Some experts here also view the recent increase in American interest rates as a precursor of higher Japanese rates. The boost in the dollar sprang partly from an improvement in American trade statistics, which show the imbalance between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports and exports is shrinking. That shift _ while good news for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry _ threatens to divert the lifeblood of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s boom, which has drawn its strength from a steady stream of exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeing the high side of this process,'' <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said of the changing trade relationship. `` But its trading partners are beginning to feel the heat. This is now beginning to show a strain on the Japanese economy.'' <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said there was so much growth last year that if the Japanese economy had zero growth in 1988, it would still be 3.4 percent above a year ago. The Japanese government's leading index of economic indicators fell two months in a row, in March and April. A decline two months in a row typically has meant a recession in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> within four to eight months. Industrial production was down 3.8 percent for April and May, which portends zero or negative growth for the second quarter. Housing starts have been falling rapidly, following a boom last year that raised real estate prices and cooled the enthusiasm of prospective home buyers. The gloomy view is far from universal, however. Last week, a group of 21 Japanese financial institutions issued a glowing report on the state of the economy, saying growth through the fiscal year was expected to be 4.4 percent to 5.4 percent. <PERSON> Teruhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mano </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, said the recent market swings are `` merely an adjustment, not an indicator of recession.'' He also takes issue with the housing slowdown, which he says is merely a reaction against prices that were too high to begin with. `` The dollar went up, and the market went down,'' he said of the stock market drop. `` Our economy is reacting to the capitalistic system. It shows it is working well.''

<HEAD>Computer Firm's Income Jumps 91 Percent In 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, enjoying higher than expected orders for two new desktop computers, Monday reported a 91 percent jump in net income for the second quarter. Sales for the second quarter increased 71 percent compared to the same period a year ago. The Houston-based firm on June 20 began volume shipments of two new desktop computers and were met with stronger initial dealer demand than any other product in the company's history, officials said. `` Our solid second-quarter financial results reflect continued strong worldwide demand for our high-performance, industry-standard products,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer. Part of the increase was a non-recurring, pretax gain of nearly $ 10 million that resulted from an increase in the carrying value of the company's investment in <ORGANIZATION> Conner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peripherals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was offered publicly for the first time during the quarter. During the second quarter of 1988, net income rose to $ 59 million, or $ 1.45 per share, on sales of $ 457 million from $ 31 million, or 80 cents per share on sales of $ 268 million a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s gain from the <ORGANIZATION> Conner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peripherals </ORGANIZATION> public offering increased earnings per share by about 15 cents in the period, officials said. Net income for the first six months of 1988 was $ 105 million, or $ 2.66 per share, compared with $ 51 million, or $ 1.36 per share, in the first half of 1987. Sales totaled $ 896 million up from $ 478 million. The company established a subsidiary in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> during the second quarter, bringing to 43 the number of countries where <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> computers are available.

 The stock market drifted in a narrow range today in an inconclusive session.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that its second-quartyer earnings rose 3.9 percent on an 11 percent sales increase. The pharmaceutical manufacturer, which is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws, said its earnings were hurt by the accrual of certain costs and expenses that it expects will be incurred as part of its Chapter 11 reorganization plan. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> earned $ 8 million, or 33 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared to $ 7.7 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. But the company said its earnings for the quarter would have increased 130 percent without the Chapter 11 costs. Sales for the quarter rose to $ 202.6 million from $ 182.2 million in 1987. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $ 24.8 million, up 2 percent from the $ 24.5 million in the comparable period last year. For the first six months of the year, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> said it earned $ 22.1 million, or 91 cents per share, down 34 percent from $ 33.7 million, or $ 1.40 a share, a year ago. Six-month revenue rose 9 percent to $ 428.7 million from $ 392 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1985 as injury claims mounted against its Dalkon Shield birth control device. The company's reorganization, including a merger with the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to receive court ratification later this summer.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Gold Falls In Profit-Taking</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar climbed higher at the end of trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Monday, despite central bank intervention to hold it down, dealers said. Gold prices fell more than $ 7 an ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on what dealers said profit-taking after last week's advance. Dollar trading was initially hectic Monday, dealers said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency jumped sharply in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, but was brought lower when the West German central bank intervened to sell dollars, they said. `` At present levels, there is new demand,'' a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealer said. Dealers said they believed the dollar hit bottom late last week and is heading for higher ground again. Some dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the central bank may have intervened partly to prop up the mark against the British pound, which also strengthened against the West German currency Monday. Dealers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the pound continued to be buoyed by the market's belief that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s relatively high interest rates are unlikely to come down in the near future, putting the brakes on inflation. But the British currency fell against the dollar. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.7265, compared with $ 1.7405 Friday. Other late dollar rates, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8452 West German marks, up from 1.8265; 1.5345 Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 6.2215 French francs, up from 6.1630; 2.0745 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0615; 1,359.50 Italian lire, up from 1,353.75; 1.2075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 131.80. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 132.08 yen. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 434.75 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 442. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was lower, closing at a bid $ 437.50, compared with $ 442.50 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 34 cents to close at a bid $ 444.28. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 7.60 a troy ounce, compared with Friday's $ 7.76.

Soybeans for August delivery have skidded more than $ 1.90 a bushel over six consecutive losing sessions. Light, scattered showers fell during the weekend and Monday in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, continuing a pattern that developed in mid-July to replace the unusually warm and dry conditions that had dominated the region during the previous three months. `` There is certainly a lot of varying opinion over how much benefit it may have done for the crop, but traders clearly are responding to the fact that moisture exists, and that's a significant departure from what we saw in April, May and June,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At the close, wheat was 6 cents to 13 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.71 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 7 cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 3.02 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 7 cents lower with September at $ 2.54 a bushel; soybeans were 21 -LCB- cents to 30 cents lower with August at $ 8.00 -LCB- a bushel.

 Troubled food giant <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> named the head of rival <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as its new top executive Monday, but the announcement drew a negative reaction on Wall Street. Analysts said they were skeptical that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who lacks solid experience in the restaurant business, would be able to quickly turn around <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s flagging Burger King fast-food chain as well as engage in tough competition to defend the company's consumer food products. Echoing those concerns, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock fell $ 1.50 a share to $ 35.37 -LCB- in afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 54, has been chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest food concern, and vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> in He is to begin his new job Aug. 1. He is taking over from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>, who returned from retirement to run <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> on an acting basis nearly five months ago when the previous chief executive was pressured to leave the company. Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth largest food conglomerate, produces <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> vegetables, Haagen-Dazs premium ice creams and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s frozen fish. In addition to the 5,500-unit Burger King chain, it also owns <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s restaurants. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it had agreed to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Bumble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafoods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego-based </LOCATION> producer of canned seafood with annual revenue of $ 265 million. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> also said it had decided to sell off its grain merchandising division and use the proceeds to finance the Bumble Bee acquisition. In prepared statement, <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> said that `` attracting a top-flight chief executive has been a major priority.'' He called <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` a gifted and capable leader -LRB- who -RRB- has the unanimous support of our board of directors and the senior management.'' Analysts have been critical of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, saying it lacked clear and vital leadership over the past few years. Its after-tax profit plummeted 62 percent in fiscal 1988 to $ 69.3 million on sales of $ 6.2 billion, largely because of a restructuring charge associated with the sale of the Godfather's Pizza chain and a number of other restaurant operations and consolidations The restaurant unit, which accounts for nearly half of the company's total revenue, reported a 5 percent drop in sales in the fiscal year ended May 31 as Burger King continued to lose market share to rival <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s weakness has been more related to restaurants, and if they got a guru in restaurants, they may have been better off,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Froelich </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> has been pouring as much as $ 200 million a year into touting Burger King restaurants amid criticism that the advertising campaigns were less than effective The company also faces stiff competition in its consumer foods business. Under <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s leadership, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> also has suffered lagging growth and earnings. `` You ca n't say his track record at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> would lend itself to any wide-eyed enthusiasm,'' <PERSON> Froelich </PERSON> said. Much of General Foods' difficulites can be linked to its core <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee business, which is suffering from lackluster growth. But analysts point to other potential problems. `` <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has been a big cheese in a company with a lot of easy brands,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Hopwood </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, referring to <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> luncheon meats and Jell-O brand gelatin. Because <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> has few high-growth products, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` will have to get down to trench warfare, and he was never in that mode before,'' <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said. While some analysts speculated that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> might be unhappy with <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s performance at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, others suggested <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> merely wanted to run his own show. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 22-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that `` <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> is a terrific company with fine businesses and excellent people.'' `` I'm looking forward to leading this company aggressively with its exciting and challenging opportunities,'' he said. The 65-year-old <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> returned to the helm at <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> after the ouster of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> had groomed as his successor and who presided over <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s first earnings decline in 16 years. <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> had run the company from 1973 through 1985. Speculation had been swirling on Wall Street recently that despite its difficulties, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> might be a takeover target. But analysts are divided as to how attractive a takeover candidate <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> may be. <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, for instance, said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> had `` too many wrecks in the ditch right now.'' Some people have said the Burger King chain could fetch as much as $ 1.5 billion if it were spun off as a separate company, but <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> estimated the chain would bring only about $ 900 million because it was at least two years away from a turnaround. <ORGANIZATION> Pilip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> issued a statement praising <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s tenure at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> and said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s position would not be filled. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the heads of the subisidary's domestic foods, coffee and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> units would report directly to him.

<HEAD>Construction Will Slide 5 Percent in 1988, Forecast Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction contracts will decrease 5 percent this year as the nation's continuing building slump is worsened by a fall in housing starts, according to a private forecast issued Monday. Construction contracts in 1988 are expected to total $ 246 billion, down from $ 257.62 billion last year, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. In its latest <ORGANIZATION> Dodge-Sweet </ORGANIZATION>'s Construction Outlook, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> predicted housing starts would tumble 9 percent to 1.45 million units this year, with most of the drop coming from the apartment sector. The contract value of housing construction is expected to fall 3 percent, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> said. The housing situation could worsen if credit becomes more expensive in reaction to inflationary pressures, the business information company said in a news release. Overall construction has slumped this year because of several years of overbuilding in the commercial and office markets, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> said. The company forecasts the contract value of office building will plunge 14 percent this year, while store and other commercial building will drop 12 percent. The total value of non-residential construction contracts is expected to fall 8 percent. Public works construction contracts are forecast to remain steady, totaling $ 42.25 billion, in comparison with $ 42.44 billion in 1987.

The CDs will carry a federal guarantee that the full amount of principal and interest will be paid through their maturity date even if American Savings is put into receivership by the federal government, said <PERSON> Layna </PERSON> <PERSON> Browdy </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, parent of the S & amp; <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's second-largest thrift and is the target of a rescue effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

The CDs will be sold through a group of Wall Street brokers led by <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the spokeswoman said. A letter of assurance from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> states that holders of brokered CDs would be paid on schedule if the government put the thrift into receivership, Ms. <PERSON> Browdy </PERSON> said. Often, time deposits are paid off all at once when an institution is placed into receivership. Sale of the CDs could help stem an outflow of deposits at the institution, but is n't a response to American Savings net deposit outflow of $ 978 million in the second quarter, Ms. <PERSON> Browdy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> officials have been discussing such a sale internally for about a year with the idea of attracting depositors from outside the area covered by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> branch network, she said. The CDs will be sold in denominations of $ 1,000 with terms of three, six, nine and 12 months. The timing and amount of the initial sale had n't been set, Ms. <PERSON> Browdy </PERSON> said, adding that the total amount sold could total $ 2.5 billion over a period of time.

 Representatives of fast-food giant <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> testified Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was infringing upon its trademarks by using the name McSleep Inn for a new chain of economy hotels McDonald's took immediate exception last September to the use of the `` Mc'' prefix after Quality Inns announced the new chain of hotels, which will offer a night's lodging for $ 20 to $ 29. After repeated warnings from McDonald's to stop using the name, Quality Inns filed suit against the international hamburger chain, asking a federal judge to declare that <PERSON> McSleep </PERSON> does not infringe on the chain's trademarks. McDonald's counter-sued Quality Inns, charging that use of the `` Mc'' prefix constitutes an infringement and that the public will likely confuse the inns with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` We wanted to remove any cloud that was hanging over Quality,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefter </PERSON>, chief trial counsel for the lodging company based at Silver Spring, Md. `` There's absolutely no likelihood of confusion with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. The -LRB- McSleep -RRB- logo is very distinctive.'' The McSleep logo is a variation on the Quality Inns logo of a setting sun bordered by a black square, very distinct from McDonald's golden arch, said <PERSON> Hefter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hefter </PERSON> said the `` Mc'' prefix was selected because it connotes a clear impression of value, affordable quality service. `` McDonald's may have played a part in promoting that type of image, but we believe that it has gone beyond that into the lexicon,'' he added McDonald's began its defense Monday in the trial which began July 18 before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemeyer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, vice president of advertising for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, said the company spent more than $ 404 million last year in advertising. In one of more than a dozen videotaped McDonald's commercials presented in court Monday, the promotional character <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> taught children to put the prefix before many different words, including Mc-fries, Mc - -LRB- milk -RRB- shakes and Mc-best The purpose of the commercial was to create a Mc-language, specifically associated with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bergold </PERSON> said. `` McDonald's is the largest single-brand television advertiser in the country,'' he said. Surveys found that in the last four weeks, 89 percent of the nation's children between 2 and 7-years-old have visited a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, and 96 percent of all adults have visited a McDonald's at least once, <PERSON> Bergold </PERSON> testified. `` We're trying to establish the impact and awareness that <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> has on the public, and why it's likely that they're going to be confused'' by the McSleep chain, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasander </PERSON>, an attorney for McDonald Chief trial counsel for McDonald's, former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> attorney general <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, said a McDonald-sponsored survey indicated that more than 30 percent of the participants associated <PERSON> McSleep </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. McDonald's successfully sued the owner of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> store called McBagel. A federal judge ruled that the business community generally recognizes that the `` Mc'' formative stands as a symbol of McDonald's services and products. But <PERSON> Hefter </PERSON> said other company names not associated with food bear the `` Mc'' prefix, including McThrifty and McLube. The McSleep Inns will offer a basic room with a bath, but no pool, meeting rooms, food service or restaurant. Quality Inn, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Manor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, hopes to franchise about 200 such inns by 1991. Testimony in the trial is expected to end Wednesday.

He has even taken offenders to court and collected, and said Monday he's formed a group to help others do the same. `` These big companies feel that they can cause this low-level annoyance that -LRB- most -RRB- ... of the nation feels is an invasion of their privacy,'' said <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON>, 42, who works as a lawyer's assistant A nationwide telephone survey of 600 consumers found that 79 percent think telephone sales calls are annoying, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlanker </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Schlanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Linden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, conducted the survey last year. <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON> said he became fed up with such calls a couple of years ago when a salesperson called and said, `` ` Hi. If you'd like to buy a magazine subscription, we'll make a 12 percent gross donation to Special Olympics.''' He started to offer a $ 5 donation `` when the guy says, ` You do n't have to hang up on me. I'll just call the next guy,''' <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON> recalled. `` I called the Special Olympics and said, ` What's going on?' They assured me I'd never be bothered again,'' he said. But a year later, he got another call on their behalf. `` I'm not against Special Olympics. But I am for my privacy in my home,'' <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON> said. When phone solicitors call, he advises them, `` Any subsequent calls from your company will be accepted on a for-hire basis for the use of my personal property and time.'' <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON> said he warns he will charge $ 100 for their next call, and so far, he said, he's collected about $ 250. One case involved <ORGANIZATION> Plan-O-Soft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conditioning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of nearby <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, which wanted <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON> to buy a water conditioner. The <LOCATION> Du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Page </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge who heard the case `` stood up and he said, ` I was called recently and twice during the football game and I'm sick of these things,''' <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON> said. He won 97 cents _ the monthly cost of not listing his number in the telephone book. `` It's not the money,'' he said. `` It's the fact that I as an American citizen have rights.'' <PERSON> Plan-O-Soft </PERSON> disagrees. `` I think that he's very unreasonable. I do n't think he deserves to have a telephone,'' said <PERSON> Delphine </PERSON> <PERSON> Malovich </PERSON>, the company's owner. `` We're not intruding on his privacy. All he has to say is he's not interested and hang up the phone,'' she said <PERSON> Plan-O-Soft </PERSON> has taken <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON>'s name off their customer list, and when a new supervisor calls him by mistake _ which has happened a few times _ they pay. `` I think the last time we just sent him a $ 7 check, and that made him happy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Malovich </PERSON> said. In May, he formed <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, designed to help pestered people fight back. For $ 15, members can have their names printed on a list to be sent to telemarketing companies, with a warning that callers will be required to pay. To solicit membership, <PERSON> Bulmash </PERSON> plans _ what else? _ direct marketing. But he'll use the mails, not the phone, and envisions a flyer that reads: `` Junk Mail. Help stop junk phone calls.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Gold Falls on Deflationary Signals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose sharply and gold prices skidded to five-month lows Monday as the markets picked up signals that inflation was easing. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 427.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $ 14.75 from late Friday's $ 442 On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a troy ounce of gold closed at $ 425.90, down $ 16.30 from $ 442.20 late Friday. Monday's close was gold's lowest since it finished at $ 425 a troy ounce on Feb. 29. Gold prices `` took a tremendous hit today,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, a vice president and bullion dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, traders bought gold and silver heavily on rumors about the silver miners strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. But Monday, there was `` panic selling'' as precious metals prices began to slip, <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Donney </PERSON>, a research analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the metals market reacted to a drop in commodities prices and a rise in short-term interest rates. Both developments are believed to be harbingers of a slowing in inflation, while precious metals are considered a hedge during periods of higher inflation. Gold's decline began in the Far East and accelerated throughout the trading day. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the metal fell 34 cents to close at a bid $ 444.28. It dropped $ 7.25 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to close at a bid price of $ 434.75. And in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, it skidded to a bid $ 437.50, compared with $ 442.50 late Friday. Silver was sharply lower on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, closing at $ 7.036, compared with late Friday's $ 7.606. In earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, silver was quoted at a late bid price of $ 7.60, down from Friday's $ 7.76. Meanwhile, the possibility of lower inflation boosted the dollar. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a first vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar gained its strength from the drop in commodities prices, including the plunge in gold and silver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior foreign exchange trader <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said position squaring also contributed to the dollar's gains. In European trading, the dollar rose despite central bank intervention to hold it down, dealers said. Overseas dealers said they believed the dollar hit bottom late last week and is heading for higher ground again. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 131.80. Later, it was quoted at 132.08 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and it rose to 132.175 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from late Friday's 130.84. The British pound fell against the dollar. Sterling was quoted at $ 1.7265 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, compared with $ 1.7405 Friday, and it fell to $ 1.7210 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from late Friday's $ 1.74225. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.84705 West German marks, up from 1.82775; 1.5380 Swiss francs, up from 1.5180; 6.2345 French francs, up from 6.1665; 1,363.75 Italian lire, up from 1,352.55; and 1.21475 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2009 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8452 West German marks, up from 1.8265; 1.5345 Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 6.2215 French francs, up from 6.1630; 2.0745 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0615; 1,359.50 Italian lire, up from 1,353.75; 1.2075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983

<HEAD>Mellon Shuffles Bad Loans To New Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will shift $ 1 billion in bad loans into a new independent bank to stabilize <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings and improve its recently troubled finances. `` Last June, we said we'd deal with our problems as aggressively as we could ... that we were not going to disembowel the company in any form. This step is just a logical extension,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahouet </PERSON>, chairman of the bank holding company that ranked as the nation's 16th-largest at the end of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> will raise $ 525 million in fresh capital for its own operations, while infusing the new <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> with $ 130 million in cash. In exchange, <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> will retain $ 100 million in preferred stock in the new bank and will pass along $ 30 million in common stock to <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders as a dividend. The recapitalization plan is similar to one used by banks experiencing severe financial problems, in which a portfolio of problem loans are transferred to a separate `` bad bank'' while a healthier parent bank retains the good loans, <PERSON> Cahouet </PERSON> said. This is the first time, however, that the `` good bank-bad bank'' approach has been adopted by a relatively healthy bank, <PERSON> Cahouet </PERSON> told a news conference. Grant Street National will not take public deposits. It will have its own own five-member board of directors, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> last year reported losing $ 844 million because of potentially bad loans in the energy-dependent <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and in developing countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We could have managed the problems over the next three, four or five years. Now at least we're saving all that time and we can get on with developing the future of the institution,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Terracciano </PERSON>. Standard and <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the securities rating firm, said the move will bolster <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>'s finances, help stabilize earnings and free up managers. The new bank, whose name reflects <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>'s street address in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, will buy the bad loans for $ 575 million in cash and securities, a deep discount off their book value of $ 1 billion. Grant Street National will sell $ 425 million to $ 450 million worth of high-yield, junk bonds underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment banking concern. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> will take a $ 200 million charge to third-quarter earnings as a result of the deal, <PERSON> Cahouet </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>'s exposure to risk will be limited to the $ 100 million in preferred shares it holds in the new bank. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>'s $ 525 million in new capital will come from $ 275 million in three series of preferred shares and $ 250 million in equity purchase contracts from a group of investors. The $ 525 million will help meet anticipated funding guidelines that bank regulators are expected to impose in 1992, <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials said they expect to receive regulatory approval for the recapitalization, which should be completed in the third quarter.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Plunge On Wet Weather; Soybeans At 2-Month Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices settled at a two-month low Monday after falling for the sixth straight day on perceptions that a wetter weather pattern was bringing a gradual recovery of drought-stressed Midwestern crops, analysts said. Grain futures also finished sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, precious metals futures plummeted; cattle were up while pork futures were down; energy futures fell; and stock-index futures advanced. As rain puddles dried outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, most contracts for future deliveries of corn and soybeans plunged their respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel. The August soybean contract has skidded $ 1.91 a bushel over six consecutive losing sessions and finished Monday at $ 8.00 -LCB-. Light, scattered showers fell during the weekend and Monday in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, continuing a pattern that developed in mid-July to replace the unusually warm and dry conditions that had dominated the region during the previous three months. `` There is certainly a lot of varying opinion over how much benefit it may have done for the crop, but traders clearly are responding to the fact that moisture exists, and that's a significant departure from what we saw in April, May and June,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, disagreed with weather-related explanations of the markets' behavior. <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> cited last week's bullish long-range forecasts for a return to hot, dry conditions in the Farm Belt and said: `` The market is just not concerned about weather anymore.'' He said Monday's sell-off probably was triggered by reports of large build-ups of peanut oil and Malaysian palm oil, which compete in the market with soybean oil. Traders also were said to have sold on rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s new 6-to-10-day outlook would predict continued wet weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. That forecast, which was issued after the close, did indeed predict above-normal rainfall in most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the first five days of next week. Wheat settled 6 cents to 13 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.71 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 7 cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 3.02 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 7 cents lower with September at $ 2.54 a bushel; soybeans were 22 -LCB- cents to 30 cents lower with August at $ 8.00 -LCB- a bushel. The drop in crop futures helped trigger a collapse in precious metals futures prices on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Gold futures settled at their lowest levels since April 8, 1987. Investment demand for precious metals tends to rise and fall with expectations for inflation, so analysts said the lower grain futures, lower oil futures and Monday's stronger dollar all contributed to the sharp decline in gold and silver futures. `` The fact that it was a fairly thin market -LRB- with relatively few people trading -RRB- also contributed to it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, chief precious metals trader for <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 16.30 to $ 18.40 lower with August at $ 426.60 a troy ounce; silver was 57 cents to 62.8 cents lower with July at $ 7.036 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, most cattle futures ignored Friday's bearish quarterly cattle-on-feed report and settled higher in line with higher cash markets, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Pork futures fell sharply in reaction to another <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report showing near-record numbers of pork bellies in cold storage, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said Live cattle were .12 cent to .60 cent higher with August at 66.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .53 cent higher with August at 77.75 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent to 1.30 cents lower with August at 45.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .85 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with August at 36.80 cents a pound. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 40 cents lower with September at $ 16.05 a barrel; heating oil was .78 cent to .92 cent lower with August at 44.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .85 cent to 1.04 cents lower with August at 51.22 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index up 1.18 points at 264.68

<HEAD>FCC Threatens US Sprint With Sanctions Over Consumer Billing
Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it may fine <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unless the long-distance phone company does a better job responding to consumer billing complaints. Customer complaints about inaccurate, incomplete and late bills have plagued the nation's third-largest long-distance company since it was formed in July 1986 and have contributed to its losses. In a letter last week to <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it was concerned about the volume of billing complaints it has received from <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> customers and the company's `` inadequate and inaccurate responses.'' While other carriers have experienced billing complaints, they usually correct the problem within two to three months, said the letter, signed by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s top telephone official. `` In <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s case, however, various billing and related problems have been occurring for well over a year,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. `` These problems have been compounded by <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s apparent inability to promptly rectify complaints either when a customer directly contacts <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> or when the customer contacts the commission.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> 20 days to explain the procedures it has in place to investigate complaints forwarded by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> and what steps it intends to respond to these complaints within the 30 days required by law. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint officials had no comment Monday on the letter. Previously, the company has blamed the billing errors on computer problems and has said it was bringing the foulups under control. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone enforcement unit, said the agency received 1,821 complaints against <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> between Oct. 1, 1986, and July 14, but said `` we would be seeing the tip of the iceberg of what <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> sees'' in complaints directly from customers. During the same period, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> received 1,114 complaints against <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and 494 against <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, the nation's largest long-distance company, says it serves about 70 percent of the interstate long-distance market, while <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> claims about 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> about 6 percent. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, if not satisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to make timely responses to complaints, could fine the company as much as $ 2,000 per violation, up to a total of $ 20,000. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it was selling most of its 50 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> to its partner in the venture, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> will raise its stake in <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> to 80.1 percent early next year <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 138 million in the first quarter of 1988 after racking up losses of $ 800 million last year. The two parents have shared those losses equally.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that its after-tax profit slumped 19.5 percent in the second quarter because of special charges related to asbestos clean-up costs and the shutdown of a plywood operation. The building materials company said its net profit totaled $ 33.1 million, or $ 1.12 a share, in the April-June period, compared with earnings of $ 41.1 million, or $ 1.45 a share, in the same 1987 quarter. Revenue rose 8.3 percent to $ 561 million from $ 517.8 million. For the first six months, profit fell 18.1 percent to $ 68.8 million, or $ 2.35 a share, from $ 84 million, or $ 2.97 a share, in 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest oil company, said Monday its after-tax profit rose 4 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, while <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 company, reported a 60 percent surge in earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also reported gains. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said higher earnings in its refining and chemical operations offset lower results from crude oil exploration and production. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> also cited refining and chemical operations for its gains as well as improvements in efficiency. Exxon, with headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had a net profit of $ 1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the April-June period, which was up from $ 1.15 billion, or 81 cents a share, in the same period of 1987. Revenue rose 7 percent to $ 21.63 billion from $ 20.16 billion. For the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 2.66 billion, or $ 1.96 a share, up 20 percent from $ 2.22 billion, or $ 1.56 a share, in 1987. Revenue increased 10 percent to $ 43.63 billion from $ 39.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.G. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said profit `` margins were stronger as supply costs dropped and product prices firmed'' during the second quarter. He also said increased demand for petroleum products boosted sales volume in both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said its second-quarter profit jumped to $ 487 million, or $ 1.18 a share, from $ 304 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent to $ 14.2 billion from $ 12.3 billion.

On June 23, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> completed the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary for about $ 1.6 billion to an investor group including senior management of the retailer. No. 5 <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, saw its second-quarter earnings soar 115 percent _ to $ 667 million, or $ 2.59 a share, from $ 311 million, or $ 1.22 a share.

First-half revenue was up 9 percent, to $ 11.9 billion from $ 10.9. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and is the sixth biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company, attributed a 21 percent rise in its earnings to the recent reorganization of its refining and marketing operations. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s quarter profit rose to $ 400 million, or $ 2.19 a share, from $ 330 million, or $ 1.80 a share, in 1987. Revenue rose 12.2 percent to $ 4.6 billion from $ 4.1 billion. In the first half of the year, the company earned $ 801 million, or $ 4.39 a share, up from $ 569 million, or $ 3.11 a share.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its second-quarter profit fell by 29.5 percent from a year earlier, due mainly to a charge taken to reflect a $ 17.6 million court judgment against the company. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> posted after-tax profits of $ 46.6 million, or $ 1.87 a share, down from $ 66.1 million, or $ 2.31 a share during the same period last year. The latest quarter's earnings also included net income of $ 700,000 from discontinued operations. The year-earlier quarter included a $ 7 million gain from the sale of the company's polymer products division. Quarterly sales were $ 886.3 million, up from $ 807.7 million during the same period last year. The company said its net earnings from continuing operations rose 2.9 percent during the period, to $ 63.6 million from $ 61.8 million. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last week affirmed a 1983 jury award of $ 17.6 million against <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> stemming from a 1976 lawsuit that PKL Liquidating Trust filed against <ORGANIZATION> Cutler-Hammer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> bought in 1978. The lawsuit concerned PKL's minority shareholding in <LOCATION> Macrodata </LOCATION>, which merged with <ORGANIZATION> Cutler-Hammer </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said it is appealing the ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> makes automotive, industrial, commercial and defense products including truck transmissions, engine components, electrical equipment and controls. For the first half of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Eaton </ORGANIZATION> reported net income, including discontinued operations, of $ 106.9 million, or $ 4.28 a share, down 15.3 percent from the $ 126.3 million, or $ 4.33 a share, in the same period last year.

But in light of the inquiry, <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s board reaffirmed its support for an earlier $ 750 million, or $ 57.50 per share, buyout bid from a group of investors backed by a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> York </PERSON> said the antitrust investigation presented risks of delays and possible non-completion of its proposed acquisition. The length of the investigation into whether the <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> would violate antitrust laws could not be determined, <PERSON> York </PERSON> said. Several weeks before the <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> offer was made in mid-June, <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a new group capitalized by <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and other investors. <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> is due to complete its tender offer for about 88 percent of the outstanding York shares by Friday, <PERSON> York </PERSON> said. More than a dozen suits have been filed by shareholders who are attempting to block the Citicorp-led offer on the grounds the $ 57.50 a share price is too low. <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> is a privately-held company that employs about 4,800 people at nine facilities, including two in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Guild Drops Opposition to JOA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Newspaper Guild of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, the only union at the city's two largest daily newspapers, on Monday dropped opposition to a proposal to partially merge the two publications, a union official said. The decision came during a union meeting Monday morning and after the union received concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> during labor negotiations in three areas, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kummer </PERSON>, administrator of Local 22 of The Newspaper Guild. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to better pension language, a retraining program for employees laid off if the proposed joint operating agreement is approved and a cap on the number of Guild members subject to such layoff. <ORGANIZATION> Knight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement Monday welcoming the Guild's decision. `` The Guild thus joins the other five unions which originally intervened in this proceeding, in urging approval of the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. The Free Press and the Detroit News asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 for an exemption in antitrust law allowing them to merge their business, advertising and circulation departments. Editorial departments would remain separate. A spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who must rule on such exemptions, has said he plans to decide on the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> sometime before he leaves office Aug. 15. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> staff report and an administrative law judge, who held hearings into the proposal, recommended the arrangement be turned down. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> rejects the request, it would close the newspaper, with the loss of 2,200 jobs. The Free Press had 1987 circulation of 639,720 daily and 724,342 on Sundays, while circulation of the News was 678,720 daily and 839,319 on Sundays, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION>.

 Share prices eased after an early surge Tuesday morning in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar firmed against the Japanese yen as market players awaited news of American economic growth figures. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed 117.81 points Monday, closed the morning session 46.78 points higher at 27,230.31. The widely-watched market barometer gained almost 140 points within minutes of the market's opening, but concern over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures to be released Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> erased most of the gain in thin trading, analysts said.
