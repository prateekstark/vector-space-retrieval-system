<HEAD>President Signs Taxpayers' `Bill of Rights'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed a `` bill of rights'' to protect taxpayers against overzealous tax collectors, but he still must act on bills to put more money into fighting drugs and to authorize the death penalty for some drug kingpins. The tax bill provides $ 4.1 billion in benefits to farmers and other groups. `` After two years of fighting for a bill of rights, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer can at long last declare victory,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. `` For the first time since the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was established 124 years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has done something for the taxpayer rather than to him.'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oversight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was one of the principal architects of the measure, along with Sens. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev. and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, D-S The Tax Corrections Act was aimed initially at refining the massive tax overhauls of 1986. The `` bill of rights'' was inserted by lawmakers who wanted to rein in what some said was an overly aggressive IRS. The law requires 30 days' notice before the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> can seize bank accounts and other property. It also prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from promoting employees on the basis of how much they collect from taxpayers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the measure Thursday, and the White House announced the signing Friday without comment. The law will have no effect on the federal deficit. Although it would cut taxes by $ 4.1 billion over three years, it would raise others by the same amount. It orders the government to buy 540 acres bordering the Civil War battlefield at <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where developers wanted to build a shopping mall. Other major provisions: _ Extend expiring tax benefits to help lower-income families buy their first home; reward businesses for increased spending for research and experimentation, and boost incentives for investment in low-income rental housing _ Renew an expired provision that allows workers to exclude as taxable income tuition payments made by their employers; most graduate study would not qualify _ Extend an exclusion for the value of employer-financed legal-service benefits _ Prohibit a business deduction for the basic monthly cost of a home telephone

 Here, at a glance, are major provisions of a bill signed Friday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> designed to clear up confusing language and correct errors in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986. _ BILL OF RIGHTS: A `` taxpayer's bill of rights'' to rein in what some lawmakers view as an overly aggressive <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> For example, the agency would have to give 30 days' notice before seizing bank accounts and other property, and would be prohibited from promoting employees on the basis of how much they collect. _ DIESEL: Wipes out a 1987 requirement that farmers, construction companies and other tax-exempt, off-road users of diesel fuel pay the federal tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and later apply for a refund _ MUTUAL FUNDS: For 1988 and 1989, permit owners of mutual fund shares to deduct certain operating expenses of the fund without regard to a general provision allowing deduction of only miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2 percent of income _ HIGHER EDUCATION: Exempts from taxation interest earned on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds that are redeemed to finance a college or vocational education, starting in 1990 _ TUITION AID: Renews for 1988 an expired law allowing a worker to avoid tax on up to $ 5,250 a year of employer-provided education assistance Graduate education would not qualify. _ HOUSING: Extends through 1989 a tax credit for owners of newly constructed low-income rental housing Also, extends through 1989 and modifies a tax exemption for bonds issued by state and local governments to help low-income families buy their first home. _ TOBACCO: Imposes a tax of 45 cents per pound on pipe tobacco _ WRITERS: Allows free-lance writers, artists and photographers to deduct work-related expenses even before a project produces income _ ` HEIFER TAX': Permits livestock farmers to deduct expenses of producing livestock before the animals begin generating income, thus repealing what has become known as the `` heifer tax.'' _ ATHLETICS: Allows an 80 percent deduction for contributions to college athletic scholarship funds even when such `` gifts'' guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket _ RESEARCH: Extends through 1989 a credit for increased spending for research and experimentation _ JOB TRAINING: Extends through 1989 a credit under which the government pays the first year of wages for certain newly hired economically disadvantaged workers _ CONTRACTORS: Further restricts the `` completed-contract'' method of accounting that allows defense contractors and most big construction companies to delay taxes on part of their profits until a project is completed This change will raise $ 1.3 billion. _ CORPORATIONS: Accelerate estimated tax payments from corporations that switch from an annualized method of computation, raising $ 869 million _ LIFE INSURANCE: Removes some of the tax advantages of using single-premium life insurance as an investment Loans from such policies would be taxed as cash withdrawals; the new rules would apply to policies whose cash value builds more quickly than one paid through seven equal annual premiums. The change would cost policyholders $ 345 million. _ BUSINESS MEALS: Permit operators of offshore or <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil rigs and of some commercial vessels -LRB- but not luxury liners -RRB- to deduct the full cost of meals provided to employees; most business may deduct only 80 percent _ HOME SALE: Allows a surviving spouse to defer taxation on profits from the sale of a principal home, just as though the spouse had not died Present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after a home is sold and before a new one is built. Also, the provision allowing a person over 55 to avoid tax on up to $ 125,000 of profits from the sale of a principal home in which he or she had lived at least three of the last five years would be available to a person who spends up to four of those five years in a nursing home. _ HOME PHONE: Prohibits any person with a home-based business from deducting any part of the base monthly telephone charge as a business expense _ FARM MACHINERY: Tightens depreciation provisions for single-purpose farm structures, such as poultry houses, and farm machinery _ FARM INCOME: Expands a law allowing farmers to defer for one year income from the drought-forced sale of livestock Farmers also could defer taxes on payments received as a result of drought-caused crop losses. _ BANKS: Renews a tax break for healthy savings and loan associations that take over failing associations, and extends the benefit to banks _ BLOOD DONORS: Permits states and blood-collection facilities to require blood donors to list their Social Security numbers so they can be traced if tests determine their blood is carrying the AIDS virus

 GULF STREAM, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> _ A long weekend of ocean swimming, jogging and telephoning political associates from this exclusive <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> seaside community is President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s formula for unwinding from the election. While aides in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> work today on the transition that will bring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appointees to the White House next Jan. 20, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, are spending their second full day vacationing at the seaside home of their multimillionaire friends <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> in this exclusive beachfront community. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to return to <LOCATION> Washinton </LOCATION> late Monday or Tuesday, when he has a meeting scheduled with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he had spent the morning poolside talking on the telephone to various political associates, including former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called to thank for sending a congratulatory telegram. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, appearing in high spirits and in a happy mood as he kidded with his hosts and wife, said he still had not settled down after the election. `` I have n't really gotten down to the bottom of the unwinding yet,'' he said. He went for a jog, accompanied by his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents, for about two miles around the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> golf course across the palm tree-lined street from the <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> home. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> joined their wives, who had been walking on the beach, and then went out to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter stationed about 400 yards offshore. The president-elect invited along an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter who had greeted him at his driveway. The group was ferried to the cutter Point <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> by a motorized rubber raft, and the Bushes jumped in for a swim _ Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first, followed by her husband. This reporter accepted an unexpected invitation and followed them in. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an avid swimmer, swam the full distance back to shore. The president-elect grabbed a line on the back of the raft. He told his agents and aides to `` rev it up'' for the tow back to shore in the choppy, warm <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Back on shore, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> playfully took a camera from his official photographer and snapped pictures of his wife and friends. He commented several times about how pleasant the balmy setting was and joked that he was `` roughing it'' by working at poolside. Later he played some golf. Among those with whom he spoke on the telephone, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, were <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Asked if he was doing much work on the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> transition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that was being handled by his team in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Was he making lists of potential appointees? `` No, no,'' he said, then headed off for an afternoon nap.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, participants in a secret arms deal two years ago, have agreed to open trade offices in each other's capitals. A <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> statement issued Friday said the two countries' ambassadors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Saudi Arabian Prince <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>, signed a memorandum of understanding in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to set up `` commercial representative offices. The decision was reached `` with a view to further developing the friendly relations and cooperation between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in the economic and commercial field,'' embassy spokesman <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurong </PERSON> said. It was disclosed earlier this year that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> secretly purchased medium-range missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last May that while <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> refused to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles it assured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the launchers would not be equipped with nuclear or chemical warheads and it backed this by signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The opening of trade offices is often regarded in diplomacy as a symbol of thawing relations and a prelude to formal diplomatic relations between countries that do not recognize each other, such as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is one of the larges countries in the world that has continued to recognize the rival <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The policy was explained in the past as one of support for offshore <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s staunch anti-communism and opposition to the official atheism of mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But in recent months <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> newspapers have noted that the Saudis and some other countries were drawing closer to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and they have speculated that those countries might switch their diplomatic recognition. For its part, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has been relaxing restrictions against its citizens' private contacts with the Chinese mainland and expanding trade and other contacts with communist countries of the Soviet bloc. As of last January, mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had formal relations with 135 countries and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, only 23. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> switched official recognition from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1978 and maintains a broad range of relations with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> at a non-official level.

In a speech Friday on radio and television, Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> also rejected opposition demands for the early resignation of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who was defeated in an Oct. 5 referendum. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> was appointed interior minister after the referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, remain in power until 1997.

According to provisions of the 1980 constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in the referendum makes an open presidential election mandatory in December 1989, with the president surrendering power to the winner in March 1990 Opposition leaders have demandad constitutional changes to allow a speedier transition to democracy. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has refused to step down before 1990. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> said of next year's election: `` The government will not take any side, as it understands it has a subsidiary political role and must guarantee the develoment of the tasks that correspond to political parties and independent sectors. `` Although the government has the firm purpose of not involving itself in the upcoming electoral contest, it must warn about the danger of bringing to power certain groups that are close to totalitarism,'' <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> added. `` The government calls on the nation's majorities to reject once and for all the extremists.''

<HEAD>Ortega Asks To Extend State of Emergency; Paper Questions Hurricane

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> asked the national assembly to extend a 30-day state of emergency imposed just before Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> ravaged <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, state radio reported. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper on Friday claimed the government botched the chance to get substantive hurricane assistance by demanding _ rather than asking _ aid in a crude manner. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> charged the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> committed `` a great diplomatic error that cut off the aid'' by asking for `` too much -LRB- assistance -RRB- and in a bad way'' from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s diplomatic corps. The newspaper also said some of the Sandinistas' requests appeared targeted for the Nicaraguan army, rather than victims of Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> killed 116 people, left more than 200,000 homeless and caused severe damage to much of the country in its rampage across <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Citing a document it said was provided by a diplomatic source, the newspaper said government requests for field tents and certain types of medical supplies generated suspicions the request `` was a maneuver to supply the Sandinista army with medical resources.'' It said the government requested 440,000 analgesic tablets, more than 1 million serum flasks, bandages, plaster for casts, small surgical tools and other supplies more appropriate for field hospitals. La Prensa further charged that tents donated by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were not given to the homeless. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters last month that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> feared any emergency aid it offered would help the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> fight U.S.-supported rebels known as Contras. The leftist government had no immediate comment on <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>'s report Radio <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON> on Friday reported <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to extend the 30-day state of emergency imposed Oct. 20, two days before Hurricane Joan struck. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s request was expected to be approved in the assembly, where the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> holds 61 of 96 seats.

 The second time around in the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is easier, say <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrenger </PERSON>, who met and married during a stint in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION> in the 1960s and have just returned from two years in the <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. `` We had always planned on doing it again, and when our children went off to university, we just decided to do it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Derrenger </PERSON>, 47. The couple has a son who graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and a daughter who is a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. No figures were available on Peace Corps volunteer re-enlistments, but corps spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that it's happening more and more. Many of those who volunteer a second time first joined right out of college and then decided to return after retiring from their careers. `` It's a trend that's just begining to manifest itself as the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> enters its third decade, but we have a number of people in both categories,'' he said. `` The first time we were a lot younger,'' <PERSON> Derrenger </PERSON> said. `` This time we were no less enthusiastic, but we were a lot better equipped to really provide useful skills to the people.'' It was more difficult the second time for the Derrengers to break away from their everyday lives. He owned an eight-store shopping center in Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and she ran a pre-school there. At the time of their first Peace Corps tour they were newly graduated from college. But for the second go-round neither found it hard to cast off their possessions. `` It was like taking the ultimate shower. You felt so clean afterwards,'' <PERSON> Derrenger </PERSON> said. `` I had been walking around with two pockets full of keys and when we were through getting rid of the stores, the house, the vehicles, and everything, we had two keys left to the footlockers that held everything we owned.'' Said Mrs. <PERSON> Derrenger </PERSON>: `` It's kind of fun to be starting over again, just like our kids. `` When we decided to go, we got rid of everything down to the things that we were going to pass on to the children after we died. It took us two years to do it, but it's a marvelous, wonderful feeling to sell everything.'' In 1963, Mrs. <PERSON> Derrenger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION> native, headed to <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION> to teach in a girl's school in <LOCATION> Segwema </LOCATION>. Her future husband, who grew up in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a few months later to work on a program to build roads and a water supply in the isolated region. The Derrengers currently are staying with relatives in <LOCATION> Chicopee </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, and have n't made any definite plans. `` It was n't love at first sight,'' he said, recalling how she, with more experience, got the front seat in the truck carrying them from the airfield, leaving him `` to breath dust and grumble for 200 miles.'' `` It was easier this time, because we were a team and had some life experience behind us,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Derrenger </PERSON>. `` The first time I taught school. The second time I trained teachers.'' Her work in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> included developing a program to train 150 preschool teachers and establish 90 schools. His involved adapting a program teaching management skills to chiefs and other tribal leaders. `` It was something I thought about during the 25 years we were back in the states,'' he said. `` The chief system is one that works and makes sense. It just needed the application of modern management techniques.''

 More than 400 Palestinian leaders gathered today for a meeting of the Palestine parliament-in-exile in a session expected to result in the declaration of an independent <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A leading <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said the declaration would be an important step toward establishing a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland in the Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli government, claiming the move will only cause more violence, tightened security in the territories. `` From the international, legal point of view, this -LRB- independence declaration -RRB- will consecrate officially the identity of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the next step after declaration is recognition of the Palestinian state from other nations. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> met with reporters at the heavily guarded seaside center where the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the parliament-in-exile, begins a four-day meeting today. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> claimed the Israelis plan to assassinate top <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leaders. He said a list of intended victims included <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and that one assassination had been recently attempted. He did not elaborate. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, responded: `` The ... imagination of <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> has apparently been working overtime in anticipation of the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and he will say anything to get a headline.'' Israeli officials claim an independence declaration will hurt the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process and incite more anti-Israeli violence in the territories. `` The declaration is irrelevant,'' said a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON>. `` But to our sorrow, it will incite the population.'' Underground Palestinian leaders called on supporters to step up protests during the meeting. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Friday closed access to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and imposed a curfew on the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The meeting of the 450-member council is seen as a historic moment in Palestinian history and comes during an 11-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the territories. At least 310 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> told reporters: `` Palestinians have a right to a state. All other details can be negotiated.'' `` This <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> will legislate beyond doubt the line that has been presented by Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for a long time _ calling for a just peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and confirming our readiness to sit down and negotiate at an international conference,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. The Palestinian meeting comes after <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> severed its links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> last summer and after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> national elections Nov. 1 that produced gains by the right, which rejects giving up any of the occupied territories. In <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, where 1.5 million of the world's 5 million Palestinians live, several refugees doubted their parliament-in-exile will achieve a decisive breakthrough for a homeland in the meetings. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> will talk endlessly as usual,'' said <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kheit </PERSON>, 87, who owns a coffee shop in the Baqaa camp north of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s capital. Support for the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> meeting came from 17-year-old <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Naimeh </PERSON>. `` It is for our benefit, if they have positive results,'' he said. But, `` I would not go back to live with an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> neighbor even if my dad insists on returning,'' said <PERSON> Naimeh </PERSON>, whose family fled <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in the 1947-48 war.

 <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said in an opinion page article today that Editor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s resignation last week came during a discussion over control of the <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau The publisher, in today's combined editions of the newspapers, said <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> had wanted `` greater influence'' over the Cox <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau `` for as long as he worked at the Journal-Constitution.'' `` Fair enough,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Then I learned about backbiting and rumor-mongering over the bureau that did n't stop even after I said I wanted it stopped about a year ago.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did not go into any specifics. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. His home telephone went unanswered Friday night. A public rally was planned today to show support for <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>. Last Friday, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in the article, he brought up the problems with <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>. `` No sooner had I spoken than <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> replied, ` I'm gone,''' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I replied, ` I accept.''' <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> before he joined the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspapers in 1986, said in announcing his resignation that it came because of a failed effort to build `` a set of shared values and mutual trust with the senior managers of the company. ... `` <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> was credited with injecting new energy into the papers, and oversaw an expansion of their staffs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in his article today that <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> had threatened to resign many times in the past. `` It was as if there were only one permissible way to do newspapering _ <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>'s way,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` And while he's good _ maybe even great in some ways _ he's not perfect.

 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists called for further protests against the Israelis today as <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders opened a summit meeting, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and confined 650,000 <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> residents to their homes. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Israeli troops shot and wounded three Palestinians during protests Friday, hospital officials said. Two boys aged 12 and 15 were wounded in an Arab neighborhood of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in shootings that were under investigation, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, is expected to declare an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> during its four-day meeting beginning today in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. All <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents were placed under curfew as of 9 p.m. Friday, including at least 250,000 who were confined to small concrete-block homes in refugee camps. Troops standing guard at entry points to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> turned away Arab cars from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the military spokesman said. Earlier Friday, troops rounded up and detained hundreds of Palestinians in an effort to prevent rioting during the council meeting. Israeli television said authorities cut phone links with many <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> areas to further isolate them and prevent organized activities. Soldiers streamed into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighborhoods, doubling the standing police and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> forces to 1,100 men. Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said further steps would be taken as needed. `` If necessary, we will seal or clamp curfews on neighborhoods on the periphery of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' he said on Israeli television, using the Arabic news program to reach Arab viewers. `` Saturday, Sunday and Monday will be days of escalation,'' said leaflet No. 28 of the Palestinian leadership. `` All the strike forces ... should escalate protest and resistance against the forces of occupation, wherever they are in the territories.'' The leaders called for a complete strike Tuesday, at the end of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session. The Palestinian uprising in the territories has lasted nearly a year and cost the lives of at least 310 Palestinians and 11 Israelis. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The commander of Israeli forces in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, also used Israeli television's Arabic news to appeal to Palestinians to ignore calls for protests. `` No decision from the outside ... will bring change _ it will only make things worse,'' <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said, referring to the anticipated declaration of independence. `` I am appealing to residents ... to avoid clashes with the security forces.'' In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Friday, troops shot and wounded three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> men during clashes in refugee camps, hospital officials said. The camps were under curfew most of the day but clashes broke out in <LOCATION> Jabalia </LOCATION> camp during a temporary lifting of the restrictions, designed to let residents shop for food, an Arab reporter said. Youths took to the streets to protest and hurl stones at soldiers, the reporter said. A 20-year-old was shot in the left foot and a 25-year-old was shot in the back, hospital officials said. In the Nusseirat camp, also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, a 27-year-old man was shot in the leg when he violated the curfew and left his home, a hospital official said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said police were investigating whether the two <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> boys were shot by a civilian who fired live ammunition at stone-throwers who attacked his car.

<HEAD>Voters `Put Money Where Their Mouth Is' In Presidential Stock
Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential `` stock market'' that required participants to `` put their money where their mouth is'' accurately predicted the outcome of the presidential election, the market's originators say The computerized market was established by four researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> who wanted to see if it could outperform opinion polls. In it, professors and students gambled cash to buy shares of the candidates. After the election, share owners were paid a dividend that depended on the fraction of the popular vote received by each candidate. A trader could make money by accurately predicting the outcome and then bidding to buy shares at prices below his forecast or to sell at prices above it. `` In theory it's more accurate -LRB- than polls -RRB- because of the financial incentive people have to put their money where their mouth is,'' said one of the researchers, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, an economist. Prices of the candidates' shares could be converted easily into numbers showing what percentage of the public favored each candidate, <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> said. Since shortly after the second presidential debate Oct. 13, the stock market showed Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with between 51.2 percent and 53.6 percent of the vote, leading Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by a margin ranging from 5.2 percent to 8 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won Tuesday's election with 54 percent of the vote and by an 8-point margin. `` Starting Oct. 17, the market has been predicting about this outcome all along,'' said <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>. `` If you look at the polls over that period, they've been a heck of a lot more volatile.'' Gallup polls, for example, gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 6 percent advantage early in October, a 10 percent advantage near the end of October and a 9 percent advantage just before the election, said <PERSON> Coleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurray </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>'s collaborators in the project were economists <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> and political scientist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The researchers closed the market Wednesday and are beginning to analyze it. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said they would like to continue their research with a similar market next fall that will allow students at several Big 10 universities to buy and sell stock in the Big 10 football teams. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the stock traders' profits and losses had not been tallied by Friday, but one trader claimed to have earned a 30 percent profit and another said he had lost $ 40 of $ 150 wagered. Most of the 168 traders' profits and losses were probably less than a few dollars, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The market differs from polls in that it does not reflect the traders' preferences, but rather their impressions of how well each candidate is doing. Each stock trader is, in effect, a private pollster, surveying friends and following news reports. The market prices respond to the information traders pick up. Economic theory predicts that because the traders are n't being asked their preferences, they do n't have to be a representative sample of the population to accurately reflect public opinion. The researchers are far from proving that the market is an effective means of surveying public opinion, but they were encouraged when the market did not show the wild swings in public opinion that were registered in polls. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>, chief methodologist of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said an educated group like the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> stock traders `` would be less likely to show the kind of swings in popularity that the candidates do on a general population basis.'' <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> also said he did n't believe that the small sample of white, educated Midwesterners could be used to estimate public opinion nationwide. A potential advantage of the market over opinion polls is that it provides a continuous record of public opinion, <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eighmey </PERSON>, a senior vice president and market survey expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> advertising agency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he had seen the market demonstrated and found it `` really quite intriguing and impressive.'' `` It's one thing to ask a person, ` What do you think about this subject?' It's quite another when they have a personal stake in the answer,'' he said.

 Police fought young demonstrators with batons, tear gas and water cannon as tens of thousands of people rallied across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on the 70th anniversary of the rebirth of the Polish state. Earlier Friday, communist authorities held their most elaborate ceremonies to celebrate the re-establishment of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1918, when anti-Soviet leader <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilsudski </PERSON> took power at the end of World War I. Opposition groups organized independent marches and rallies in the cities of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, Wroclaw, <PERSON> Lublin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tarnow </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>. But the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> complained that protests in several cities caused a `` dissonance in the patriotic atmosphere. ... In some cities, there were demonstrations and attempts to disturb public order undertaken by irresponsible groups of youth,'' it said. Reporters watched police fire tear gas and then charge about 500 young people near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> after demonstrators threw sticks at officers. The protesters quickly scattered into a nearby park, but at least 10 were detained. The skirmish followed a torchlight march by more than 20,000 Poles chanting `` Solidarity'' and `` Independence'' in the streets of the capital following a Mass marking the anniversary. An opposition spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> said 25,000 people attended a Mass in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basilica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church, the country's largest church. Afterward many tried to march but were attacked by police in full riot gear who fired water cannon and beat demonstrators with batons. Referring to plans to shut down the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, birthplace of the banned Solidarity union, spokeswoman <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowska </PERSON> said the crowd chanted defiantly: `` Lenin is yours, the shipyard is ours.'' The turmoil ended after Bishop <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON> appealed to the police commander to call off his troops and let the mainly youthful protesters disperse unattacked, she said. In western <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> city, a two-hour battle erupted between riot police and 4,000 shouting, leaflet-throwing demonstrators, said <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessert </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist. She said scores of people were detained. Three people were hospitalized after being beaten by police in the southern industrial city of <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Moczulska </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Police also intervened after a Mass in <LOCATION> Tarnow </LOCATION>, opposition spokesmen said. People gathered peacefuly in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, Wroclaw, <PERSON> Lublin </PERSON> and other smaller cities, opposition spokesmen said. But after the main rally attended by 10,000 people in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, small groups of youth reportedly clashed with police after they decided to march on the Soviet consulate. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> crowd packed St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Cathedral in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Miziolek </PERSON> told worshipers: `` The independence of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is the concern of every generation.'' After a Mass led by boy scouts, the crowd marched down a historic street past the restored <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> to lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The popular demonstrations followed a day of gala celebrations sponsored by Polish officials, including a rare televised Mass and legions of goose-stepping soldiers in a military parade. It was the first time so much attention was paid to <PERSON> Pilsudski </PERSON>, who in 1918 had just been released from a German prison at the end of World War I. On Nov. 11, 1918, a civil council in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> turned over military power to <PERSON> Pilsudski </PERSON>, who proclaimed an independent Polish state and disarmed German troops in the capital. The dream of generations of patriots was realized with the re-establishment of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after 123 years of being partitioned between <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Nov. 11 was celebrated as independence day before World War II but was spurned by communist authorities after the war. Official attitudes toward the date have softened in the aftermath of the 1981 declaration of martial law, with the military government embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name of the `` Ojczyzna,'' the fatherland. On Victory Square, Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, wearing his army uniform and flanked by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, presided at the hourlong official ceremonies.

 Penthouse magazine publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> may buy a $ 12 million Boardwalk tract where a casino hotel was once proposed, a state appeals court has ruled. The decision Thursday was the latest ruling in nine years of protracted litigation over the site where the Mayflower Hotel once stood. <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> became embroiled in a lawsuit with <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamy </PERSON>, who were under contract to buy the hotel in 1977, according to court papers. The Shamys, of <LOCATION> Galloway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> had agreed to form a corporation to buy the property and develop a new casino hotel. But the Shamys sued for breach of contract in 1979 following a business dispute.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall Sharply Over Dollar Worries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar spiralled downward, depressing stock prices for the biggest daily loss on Wall Street since April and reflecting concerns about how President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will manage the economy. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks lost 47.66 points Friday to finish at 2,067.03. That gave the blue-chip indicator a net loss of 78.77 points for the week, the steepest election-week decline since the 1948 victory of President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. The dollar stood at a 10-month low against the Japanese yen and at five-month lows against the West German mark and British pound. Dealers noted that efforts Friday by the central banks of several nations to halt the dollar's slide failed. `` It was not enough,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Taratunio </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Central banks typically try to halt a drop in the dollar's value by buying large amounts of dollars on their domestic exhanges `` The whole market is waiting to test the resolve of the central banks, and given that, unless there is strong intervention or policy statements by the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cabinet, the dollar will continue to slide,'' <PERSON> Taratunio </PERSON> added. The dollar's decline heightened the concerns of investors who spent the week worrying about interest rates, and the nation's budget and trade deficits `` The biggest concern is whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be able to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to resolve the serious problems,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage firm. Most analysts predicted the stock market's bearish sentiment would persist in the near term as investors try to sort out the prospects for the future. The market started the week on a down note as nervous investors anticipated the outcome of the presidential election. The market gained slightly on Election Day, then slid the remainder of the week in mostly light trading. Analysts said that in the post-election environment, investors felt little conviction to commit their funds in the face of mounting questions about how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deal with the nation's twin deficits and whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise interest rates to prop up the sagging dollar. With the government bond market closed for the Veterans Day holiday and little other activity to give Wall Street impetus, stock prices tracked the eroding dollar. Statements made in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> indicated there is support for the dollar at its current, depressed levels. A lower dollar means <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products are cheaper abroad. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that while the stock market has to seek its own level, `` we, as a matter of policy, have no interest in seeing the dollar lower.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipsky </PERSON>, director of international bond research at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We are near the point where unless there is some policy action, the market will decide that a new, lower level of the dollar will not be resisted. There is little doubt that we are going to have a clear test of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy intentions regarding the dollar.'' On Friday, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by about 4-1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,235 issues down, 292 up, and 414 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 135.50 million shares, up from 128.92 million in the previous session, with many market participants away for the holiday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 159.74 million shares.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The furor over a Kristallnacht speech made by the parliament president, who resigned under intense criticism, reveals West Germans' lingering sensitivity to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. The address by Bundestag President <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> prompted charges that some Germans have not honestly faced up to what occurred under <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Nazi regime, including the extermination of 6 million Jews. `` The background of what happened is the inability of many Germans to stand up to their own past,'' the leftist Greens party said before <PERSON> Jenniger </PERSON>, a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Friday. In his speech Thursday marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht when Nazi thugs attacked Jews, <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> attempted to set the scene of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the 1930s when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> came to power, saying Germans initially found the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era `` glorious.'' <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> says the speech was misunderstood and that he is an `` uncompromising foe of every type of totalitarian rule.'' Both <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> devoted themselves this week to decrying Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night, of Nov. 9-10, 1938, the prelude to the Holocaust. The night was named for the shards of glass that littered streets after <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> smashed and burned Jewish business, homes and synagogues. West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> has insisted Germans bore full responsiblity for the Nazi era and warned against any attempts to play down its horrors. `` Nothing that historical science brings to light today can diminish the crimes of the Nazi era,'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> said last month. The East German government has also denounced the Nazi years but rejects responsibility for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> crimes, they say, because the crimes occurred before the 1949 founding of the communist country. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was founded the same year. For all their well-intentioned effort, the remembrances of Kristallnacht this week went awry with <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech. <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> recalled that many Germans in the 1930s at first felt <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> brought them `` glorious times.'' His address ignited a storm of protest _ at home and abroad. Politicians across the political spectrum called for Jenninger to resign. Angry responses came from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and from Jewish leaders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> called the Jenninger speech `` a scandal.'' Newspapers reported Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>, called him to the office to criticize him for the emotionless tone of the speech. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech showed that despite the passage of 43 years, many West Germans still have not sufficiently come to grips with what happened under <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rule. <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This event shows us how the darkest chapter of German history is still a present-day thing.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Speaker <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>, regardless of his intentions, was guilty of insensitivity to that which can never be forgotten or forgiven.'' But many observers rushed to his side, pointing to <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s record as a steadfast supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Also, no one questioned his assertions that he is anti-Nazi. The conservative daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions said <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s main error was the tone of his speech could have given the impression he had `` found a way to understand the developments of 50 years ago'' without balancing that against harsher criticism of the Nazi era. The controversy is likely to keep West Germans thinking about how best to deal with recollections of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> years, the newspaper said. `` The reasons for the fast plummet of the second-ranking official in our country will be occupying us for a long time,'' Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said. A leader of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community Thursday defended <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech. `` I welcome that the Parliament president described in full clarity what was happening in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> between 1933 and 1938,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON>, a deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of Jews in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Especially the fact that everything that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> did was strongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> said. But Friday, Jewish council chairman <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> was quoted as disavowing his deputy's comments. `` No one is supporting him. That's shown by the numerous protests that have reached me from all Jewish communities,'' the Neue Presse of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> as saying. The newspaper also quoted <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> might lose his job.

<HEAD>Gulf Crash Kills 3, U.S. Toll In Region Reaches 49</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said today that investigators are trying to determine why a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter crashed, killing all three crewmen, while preparing to land aboard a warship in the north <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The pre-dawn crash Friday was the seventh involving American military aircraft in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region, with a total of 12 dead, durin 19 months of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval operations to protect commercial shipping caught in the Iraq-Iran war. The overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualty toll during that time is 49, including 37 aboard the missile frigate USS Stark, mistakenly hit by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles in May 1987. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the SH-2F anti-submarine helicopter crashed while making a routine landing approach to the frigate USS Barbey. `` They were coming in toward the ship, they called in and said they had some kind of a problem, and then the helo -LRB- helicopter -RRB- just went down and hit the water,'' said one official. The aircraft apparently sank immediately because boats and other helicopters from the <PERSON> Barbey </PERSON>, the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and the missile cruiser USS California were unable to find any survivors or wreckage, the official said. He said names of the crew were being withheld pending notificationof next of kin. The three ships are part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier battle group now operating in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, in support of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces inside the gulf. The investigation will be conducted by the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Barbey </PERSON> and the helicopter squadron are based. In addition to the three presumed dead in Friday's crash, the overall crash toll includes two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilots killed when their AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship was lost, apparently due to hostile action by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, last April 18 and five killed in two helicopter mishaps last year in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The other two killed were pilots of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> carrier jet that crashed in the Arabian Sea during a training flight.

 Videotapes of a man accused of killing his daughter show him assuming the voices of `` Satan,'' his dead grandmother and some other of the 10 personalities that a psychiatrist says he diagnosed. A jury that began watching the videotapes Friday saw a hypnotized <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> tremble with grief and pound his fist on a table as he insisted that his daughter, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>, 19, was not dead. <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> is charged with shooting his daughter 27 times. In one videotape, <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> said his daughter visits him in jail. `` Most nights, she'll come in here to see me, after everybody else goes to sleep, and we'll talk,'' a weeping <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> said. Watching the videotape Friday, <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> frowned and looked puzzled at what he saw. Outside the courthouse, he said the man in the videotapes was not him. `` Everybody's got a twin in the world,'' the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, man said. `` I guess I've got one, too.'' <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>, 45, who is being held in a jail, is charged with first-degree murder in his daughter's death. Her nude body was found last November next to the <LOCATION> Dismal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swamp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, just inside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` Satan'' and three other of <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>'s 10 purported personalities revealed themselves in 23 hours of videotaped interviews with Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dell </PERSON>, a psychiatry professor at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION>'s testimony is key to <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>'s defense that he is innocent by reason of insanity. If convicted, he could be sentenced to death. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> viewed portions of the tapes Thursday and ruled they could be shown to the jury. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION>, in his testimony, said <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>'s memory problems and inconsistent stories are the result of multiple personalities. In the video the jury saw Friday, <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> could not remember his height, his age, or the name or phone number of his old businesses. `` It is the switching and struggles among his alternate personalities that is producing his strange and inconsistent behavior,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> said. On one tape, <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>'s voice took on a demonic snarl as he was interviewed. `` You're just a mortal,'' <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> growled, eyebrows arched, long fingernails clicking on a tabletop. `` You do n't know nothing.'' During other interviews, <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> assumed the feeble voice of <PERSON> Mammy </PERSON>, his long-dead maternal grandmother, and called out for <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>. `` Can you hear me, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> said in his grandmother's voice `` I'm so old, so old. But I got ta fix supper. Maybe you'll change your mind Eat some supper now.'' `` She ai n't supposed to be living in here,'' the Satan voice interrupted, referring to <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>'s dead daughter. `` She wo n't be in here long. She called me a bastard. `` The gun went off. ... She was sitting there screaming, and I was hollerin'. And I said, ` What are you gon na do?' And she said, ` I'm gon na shoot you, you bastard.' `` I know everything,'' the Satan voice continued. `` I am strong. I can do what I want to, when I want to. I control <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. He's dumb ... a wimp ... a goody-goody, talking that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> garbage all the time.'' Suddenly `` Viking'' spoke up, a noble, friendly personality and the first to reveal itself during <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON>'s evaluation by <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's gon na shoot her!'' <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> screamed excitedly, apparently reliving the night Ms. <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> died. `` He's gon na shoot her! No! No! I've got to protect her! Do n't shoot her! I love her.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> had argued with her father on a darkened roadside about a love letter to a married boyfriend, whom `` Satan'' called `` that stupid newt.'' Then, according to the Satan personality, Ms. <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> `` called -LRB- Satan -RRB- a bastard. She sorta goofed when she called him that.'' `` She thought she was talking to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>,'' Satan said. `` But she was talking to me.''

 The drug arrest of an elementary school principal prompted city school officials to question the system that protected him despite complaints about his job performance, drinking and drug use. The spotty record of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>, 55, which was never enough to cause his removal from the principal's post at P.S. 53 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, prompted <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to rip the principals' union. `` The union's pushing this guy back is a tremendous disservice to kids,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` This case reflects why the system of -LRB- principal -RRB- tenure to a school is very bad.'' The union, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> and Administrators, represents 4,600 principals and other administrators. <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> pleaded innocent Friday to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, crack cocaine, during arraignment in Criminal Court. He was released on his own recognizance. <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> principal ever arrested on drug charges, was scheduled to return to court Nov. 22. <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>, who will receive his $ 62,199 salary pending the end of his case, was arrested a week after Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> announced a drug crackdown in schools. His arrest Wednesday for allegedly buying two vials of crack on a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> street corner sparked a review of the process that kept him on the job for 16 years despite bad reviews and complaints. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofarelli </PERSON>, inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that his office received a tip earlier this year that <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> was having problems with drugs and alcohol. The reports said the veteran principal had nodded off in meetings and behaved erratically, <PERSON> Sofarelli </PERSON> said. But the tip _ which came in an anonymous letter _ was never substantiated, school officials said. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of the local school board that controls P.S. 53, told a Thursday night meeting of parents from the school that <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> had undergone alcoholism counseling. And a report published Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said he also had requested drug treatment. <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>'s problems caused his temporary removal from the school three times in the past seven years, said board member <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. In addition, the principal twice received unsatisfactory ratings due to absences and lateness, school officials said. Only one principal has been fired in the school system in the last nine years. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reviews </ORGANIZATION>, said that to get fired, `` You'd have to be an ax murderer.'' But union president <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsberg </PERSON>, who stressed this was an isolated incident, pointed out that there were never formal charges brought against <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>, despite all the complaints.

 An armed forces commander rejected a call by leftist rebels to observe a truce during an Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meeting next week, saying it was nothing but a public relations ploy. `` They -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- should not play with an entire people's desire for pacification,'' Col. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, commander of the 3rd army brigade in the eastern province of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, said Friday `` It -LRB- the announcement -RRB- is cynical and it is not ethical. Peace is not a momentary truce. It should not be manipulated on the international stage to give the impression that a certain will exists where it does not in fact exist,'' said <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, one of the armed forces' top colonels. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> and Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, were not immediately available for comment on the rebel proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> meeting in the Salvadoran capital is to run Monday through Saturday. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is scheduled to attend. Guerrilla leaders told a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> news conference Friday their truce would run from 6 p.m. Sunday to 6 p.m. Friday. They called on the army to observe the cease-fire. `` We have decided to suspend the military campaign and declare a five-day truce during the meeting,'' said <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella organization of leftist Salvadoran rebel groups. <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said the rebels would respond if the army attacked. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said he would not suspend military operations in the eastern zone. `` We have not entertained the idea of interrupting the fulfillment of our constitutional duty, which is to combat those who are killing the people,'' he said. `` We -LRB- soldiers -RRB- can not speak about a truce because we are not the aggressors. We are the object of aggression,'' he added. Another rebel leader, <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, proposed talks with the Salvadoran government before presidential elections are held in March and said the rebels would set no preconditions. The last meeting between government and rebel representatives was in October 1987 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The guerrillas have rejected the government's demands that they first lay down their arms. The insurgents began fighting the U.S.-backed government eight years ago and more than 65,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians. In a related development, the armed forces reported troops killed 19 guerrillas in three clashes Thursday. It gave few details and did not mention casualties among government forces.

 Government prosecutors today arrested the brother and cousin of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> on corruption charges, bringing to seven the number of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s family members arrested so far. Arrested today were <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kee-hwan </PERSON>, 59, the older brother of the ex-president, and his cousin, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo-hwan </PERSON>, 55. The two were charged with taking bribes or diverting official funds after forcibly taking over a major fish market with the help of government officials loyal to the ex-president. The arrests were made as part of government efforts to uncover alleged corruption and misdeeds involving <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, his family members and associates. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is currently investigating corruption allegations against <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who left office in February after a harsh seven-year rule, has come under severe criticism for his alleged involvement in major financial and other scandals. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing while in office.

<HEAD>Major Airlines Eliminate Short-Term Advance-Purchase Fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Just in time for the holidays, most major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines are eliminating discount fares used primarily by business travelers and others who make their trips on short notice, airline officials said. Effective Tuesday, the airlines are dropping discounts on tickets purchased three to seven days in advance. That means travelers will have to buy their tickets at least 14 days in advance and meet other restrictions to obtain the lowest fare to some destinations. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> took the first step Nov. 4 by eliminating one-way discount fares, which require advance purchase. Other big carriers, including American, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, quickly followed suit. `` We are in the middle of a fare restructuring program,'' said <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a spokesman for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. `` You will see some fares decrease and others increase.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Friday night that the eliminated <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> fares generally required seven-day advance purchase and carried a cancellation penalty. These fares accounted for less than 5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s ticket sales, he said. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it was following <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s move `` This is proof that the economy is strong and the carrier will set the rates,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> said Friday. `` The airline still has a variety of discounts available to generate traffic,'' <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> said. `` These ` junk fares' do not produce new revenue; they erode the revenue yield.'' <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> also is eliminating its one-way discount `` super-coach'' fares, which require a three -, seven - or 14-day advance purchase, depending on the market, said spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> Northwest followed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s lead `` because we have a higher cost structure and if we can still offer a competitive fare but at a slightly higher rate, that's better for us because it can help recoup our higher costs,'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, contacted Friday night, would neither confirm nor deny whether the Atlanta-based airline planned to join the discount elimination. `` The industry announced a couple of weeks ago that they would be ending some discount fares and this might very well be one of them, but I'm not certain,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` But, we are not a leader in this.'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, announced Wednesday that it was shedding its so-called junk fares beginning Nov. 15. An American spokesman said the action was in response to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s move. American's cheapest fares have relatively short advance-purchase requirements and do n't require the traveler to stay at the destination over a Saturday night. The fares usually are 10 percent to 35 percent below full coach fare. Last month, American quietly tried to eliminate the `` junk'' fares from a number of its routes originating in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Most of the affected routes were to cities that low-fare <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> formerly served from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. American twice pulled back after <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, its chief <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> rival, refused to match the move. Most recently, American delayed the plan on Oct. 25. American spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the moves by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would be more widely felt than under <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>'s original proposal, because <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> dropped its junk fares in virtually all its markets, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> matched the moves in most of those markets. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will continue its popular `` Maxsaver'' fare, which usually requires an overnight stay and may carry a cancellation penalty. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said that depending on the market, the fare requires a seven - to 14-day advance purchase

<HEAD>Navy Probes Test-Firing That Riled Japanese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said today it is investigating the firing of 10 sand-filled practice shells by an American destroyer near a Japanese coast guard vessel at the entrance to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> protested to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> over the incident Wednesday, which caused no injuries or damages. `` The area is not specifically designated for gunnery tests, and because of this the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the test,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The non-explosive projectiles struck the water about 300 yards from the Uraga, a coast guard vessel, sparking the protests. The <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> said it was a violation of international law for such firing to take place in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s waters. The visiting commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, Adm. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON>, apologized for the incident Friday as he made courtesy calls on Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and other Japanese officials. Japanese newspapers called on the government to press the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the firing, and linked it to complaints about similar incidents on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, the southern Japanese island where 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are based. `` Speaking of targets,'' the liberal-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial today, `` Okinawans often say that American servicemen treat them as though they were targets.'' The Asahi quoted the governor of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> prefecture, <PERSON> Junji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishime </PERSON>, as blaming a recent series of accidents there on `` something wanting in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's chain of command or a decline of discipline.'' On <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, rifle bullets hit a civilian housing area near a firing range in October, and after two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopters collided in flight early this month, killing four Marines, Japanese officials expressed concern over what would have happened if the collision had occurred over an <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> town. `` Probing the causes of the accidents is now an urgent task,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> editorial said. `` In a nutshell, the stationing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in a manner that puts residents on needles and pins can be of no advantage to either the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' This week's incident took place off the <LOCATION> Boso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, which guards the entrance to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, an area busy with maritime traffic. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> guided-missile destroyer USS Towers was returning to its base at <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, which is just inside the bay's entrance, when it held `` a brief gunnery test'' on a gun that had undergone maintenance, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` Although the test was very limited in nature and posed no danger to shipping, it alarmed other vessels in the general area,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is looking thoroughly into the matter and sincerely regrets it occurred,'' he said. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the Towers fired 10 sand-filled shells, aiming them at the sea. Japanese press reports quoted Transport Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> as saying the shells had apparently been aimed at the Japanese coast guard vessel.

<TEXT>
 Towns in the Sinhalese heartland face serious food shortages because of a strike by fuel workers, a government official said today. Sufficient food supplies have been sent to the southern port of <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, but gasoline shortages have prevented distribution to other towns in the region, Food Commissioner <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON> said. About 2,500 employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the island nation's only gasoline supplier, walked off the job Monday in response to a four-day strike called by the extremist <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Many workers still were not back on duty today. On Friday, <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> issued an emergency decree providing for death by hanging for people convicted of instigating strikes or refusing to report for work in `` essential services'' sectors, such as fuel and transportation. Senior officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the decree is a deterrent and the government hopes it will not be necessary to resort to capital punishment to stop strikes. The decree was the second tough measure introduced this week to try and halt anti-government protests. On Wednesday, the army was given orders to shoot on sight anyone demonstrating against the government. The day after, soldiers opened fire on thousands of anti-government demonstrators in three southern towns. At least 18 people were killed. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, soldiers continued to deliver fuel to gasoline stations where motorists waited in line for hours. At tea plantations in the hills of central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, planters predicted temporary shutdowns unless gasoline arrived within days. Tea is a mainstay of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s economy, earning more than one-quarter of the country's foreign exchange. A two-day, around-the-clock, curfew expired without being renewed in the Sinhalese heartland today, when <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> appealed to people to refrain from supporting anti-government extremists. The Sinhalese president warned that if the violence did not stop, nearly 50,000 workers would lose their jobs in the tourist industry. This week's strikes were the latest in a series called by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which the government blames for assassinations of 550 government officials and supporters the last 15 months. The front is capitalizing on a Sinhalese backlash against <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s peace overtures to Tamil insurrectionists and has vowed it will not be satisfied until the president resigns.

<HEAD>Air Force To Examine Use Of Plastics In Planes That Prompted
Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, concerned about health complaints by aerospace workers who handle plastic-based composite materials used in the Stealth fighter and other planes, has scheduled a symposium on the issue, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vest </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary for health and safety, said in a speech and in an internal memo that evaluation of the advanced materials was warranted, according to published reports. Vest said the materials are widely used in the aerospace industry although there is little knowledge about their possible health risks. Composite materials, including carbon, plastics and other synthetics, are increasingly replacing metals in aircraft construction to save weight, increase strength and defeat radar detection. Workers at a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, have gone to court with claims that the composites have caused health problems ranging from headaches to cancer. Results of a health inspection of the plant last month have not been made public. Workers at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plants in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area have made similar complaints. `` We have not yet made the necessary commitment to really understanding the effects of chemicals, building and manufacturing materials, and the processes involved with them,'' Vest said in a speech to toxicology experts Nov. 2 in <LOCATION> Fairborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to investigate health complaints by aerospace workers, and a similar probe may be conducted in the House. In a Nov. 1 memo to the surgeon general of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, Vest requested that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to hold a symposium in February on composite hazards, according to Friday's issues of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> and the Daily News of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has obligations to ensure that its workers are protected in the maintenance environment,'' the memo said. `` As a result of recent controversy regarding the occupational health aspects of the use of composites in the aerospace industry, I have made a number of inquiries and concluded that there are questions that warrant evaluation and analysis.'' Details of the symposium are being worked out, the newspapers reported. `` Composite technology is an emerging technology,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. June Green. `` This symposium is to ... discuss some of the health effects, to discuss the aspects of the technology, its implications and applications, and to get a better understanding of what this technology will bring with it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> officials expressed interest in the symposium. `` We would be interested in taking a look at whatever they're going to do We're anxious to get any and all available information,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON> said: `` I'd say it sounds like something we would be interested in taking part in.''

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Protests China's Arrest Of 20 Monks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The office of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, spiritual and temporal leader of Tibetans, says <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities arrested 20 monks entrapped by a questionnaire asking if Chinese officials should be removed from <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. `` We wish to express our deep concern at what appears to be a new form of intimidation which has been introduced in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>,'' said the letter Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. A Chinese diplomat said today the letter had been forwarded to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> but she could not say whether its allegations were true. The letter issued by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s office said the monks were arrested earlier this month `` after they had the courage to state their true feelings'' in the questionnaire. The letter said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials conducted the survey, using the name of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. It said the last time such a questionnaire was used was 1959, shortly before an abortive uprising against Chinese rule that forced the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> to flee to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1949 and annexed it a year later. The letter said the questionnaires sent to lamas, or monks, sought detailed information about their families and views on political issues. The list of 100 questions included ones that were `` clearly intended to be used as a tool for propaganda and intimidation,'' the letter said. The examples included: `` Do you hope that all the Chinese officials be removed from <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>? `` Do you hope to have the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> as the leader of the Tibetan government?'' The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> says he is willing to talk with Chinese officials about the future of his homeland. `` It is very disturbing that this new measure should have been introduced in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> at a time when His Holiness the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> is making every effort to promote a peaceful solution to the tragic issue of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>,'' the letter said. Last June he proposed the creation of `` a self-governing democratic entity'' in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> that would let <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> retain troops on Tibetan soil and conduct <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s foreign policy. That was a major concession, but a Chinese statement called it an insufficient basis for talks because the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> had not relinquished the concept of an independent <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to break resistance to reform by centralizing political power through new laws and constitutional changes that are `` tantamount to a coup,'' says dissident scientist and human-rights campaigner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. The new laws will set back the trend toward glasnost, or greater openness in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Friday at a meeting with <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Watch, the organization founded 10 years ago to monitor human rights in Soviet-bloc countries. A package of changes in the Soviet Constitution that was drawn up without public debate `` is an attempt by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to retain enough power to break the resistance to reforms by the apparatus,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. `` It looks like he was faced with the necessity to get all the power in his hands,'' he said. `` I believe he is doing it with good intentions,'' the 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner continued. `` Nonetheless, I consider it a dangerous development.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who also spoke Friday to a packed reception at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, has been an outspoken critic of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as well as his most distinguished supporter. `` The change in our personal situation was part and parcel of general change in conditions in our country,'' said the physicist, who was in internal exile in the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, until they were freed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> two years ago. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was banished in 1980 for opposing the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` It's with great hope and a lot of excitement all of us are, but unfortunately with a lot of fear as well ... watching the process unfold,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said through an interpreter. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> gathering that there is a saying going around among <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intellectuals: `` Let's not pamper <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' `` I think that postulate and the meaning they inject into it is wrong,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should be helped, but critically. `` It refers, obviously, not just to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> personally, but to all of the processes taking place in our country as well,'' he added. `` One should not think that all the problems have been already solved. On the contrary, very many of them remain.'' He said some of the changes taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are `` dangerous and complicated.'' `` Many laws which are being adopted ... are a step backwards in reality,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. In response to a question about whether Western banks should make unrestricted loans to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said, `` The West should be afraid not of the success of perestroika but of its possible failure.'' Perestroika is the Russian term for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of restructuring. `` The victory of reactionary forces ... would mean not merely a return to the era of stagnation ... -LRB- but -RRB- we would n't have money for social programs, for glasnost. However, for the buildup of our military, they would find the funds anyway.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who is making his first trip to the West, arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday, and spent several days with his wife's children outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> On Thursday, he officially received the 1973 Human Rights Award from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> at a private <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> reception. He plans to travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to visit President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the White House on Monday and attend a board meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>, a Moscow-based group of which he is a director.

<HEAD>Pop-Eyed Bug Is World's Oldest Insect, Scientists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pop-eyed bug believed to be the world's oldest insect, discovered almost by accident in a chunk of mud, suggests that insects may have originated millions of years earlier than once thought, scientists say. To the uninitiated, the fossil looks like two small specks. But to paleozoologist <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Labandeira </PERSON> and colleagues, the bug found on the north shore of <LOCATION> Gaspe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, is the oldest known insect, dating back some 390 million years. The finding is reported in Friday's issue of the journal Science, which describes remarkably well-preserved fragments of a wingless bug belonging to the most primitive order of insects and similar to the modern-day silverfish. Even more significant than the fossil's age, scientists say, is its similarity to modern bugs, which suggests that insects originated many millions of years before the specimen lived. `` What we have is two fragments. We have a head capsule .7 millimeters wide and we have a thorax 1 millimeter long,'' said <PERSON> Labandeira </PERSON>, a 38-year-old graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even though they're separate, we're very convinced that they belong to the same individual,'' he said Friday. The fossil was found by <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hueber </PERSON>, a noted <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> paleobotanist, who retrieved the specimen about five years ago while examining a mud sample he found on the <LOCATION> Gaspe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Its importance was only recently discovered when he and other scientists compared notes. <PERSON> Hueber </PERSON>'s interest was in prehistoric plant fragments in the dirt, but what looked like ancient insect parts caught his eye. `` He had an idea that there was something very important'' about the fragments, <PERSON> Labandeira </PERSON> said. Through sophisticated dating techniques, <PERSON> Hueber </PERSON> `` determined that it was an early arthropod and probably an insect,'' said <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Beall </PERSON>, a scientist at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Field Museum who has been working with the specimen. `` He knew that if this was an insect fossil it would be very significant,'' <PERSON> Beall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hueber </PERSON> gave the specimen to <PERSON> Beall </PERSON>, who _ with <PERSON> Labandeira </PERSON>'s help _ determined that it was in fact a bug and what they believe is the world's oldest known insect. It lived 390 million to 392 million years ago and the scientists say it predates by about 15 million years what previously was believed to be the oldest insect _ represented by an eye fragment found in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The bug's most imposing features are two disproportionately large eyes on each side of its head. It also had two antennae and two armlike appendages that appear to have been equipped with sensors to detect odors and vibrations. `` The significance is that they have a head, so it's really a clincher that there were insects at that time,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON>, a biology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hampden-Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> specimen is being studied. `` The exciting thing to me is that these insects have changed very little as far as we know in almost 400 million years,'' <PERSON> Shear </PERSON> said. `` That suggests that they were almost already modern in form 400 million years ago, that they had a long history before that,'' he said. The newly discovered fossil eventually will be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for its permanent collections, <PERSON> Labandeira </PERSON> said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> paused to honor its veterans with a multitude of parades, speeches, award ceremonies and quiet moments to remember the thousands who lost their lives in the fight for freedom. In <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a mother wiped tears from her eyes as she buried the remains of a son whose plane was lost over <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1967. An 88-year-old World War I veteran in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attended a memorial service planned by officials who had thought he was dead. And in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, red, white and blue ballons were set free during the dedication of a Korean-Vietnam Veterans Memorial, thought to be the first combined memorial to honor those who died in the two conflicts. At the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid tribute Friday to the 58,000 killed in that war and said, `` In our hearts you will always be young.'' Several thousand people gathered on the Mall to face the polished black granite memorial, including several men wearing military jackets and some in wheelchairs, who heckled <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during his speech. `` What I can say to our <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets is ` welcome home,''' the president said. He added that despite the divisions in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> over the war, `` who can doubt that the cause for which our men fought was just?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, left a note addressed to `` our young friends'' at the base of the memorial. Earlier, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presented a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A Veterans Day parade in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> failed to draw many spectators but did manage to draw attention to the fact that many of the city's homeless are veterans, officials said. `` Too many of our veterans are homeless. And that's our shame,'' said <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a World War II Marine. In <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, more than 100 former prisoners of war were presented with medals in a ceremony at the Mississippi War Memorial Building. `` It came late, but better late than never,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegwood </PERSON>, 74, a former Marine who was held for 40 months by the Japanese in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peason </PERSON> was buried in his hometown of <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on Friday. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>'s remains were returned to this country last summer by the Vietnamese, and positive identification was made last month. `` It's a relief and a big weight off my shoulders,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>. `` He's home. That's the biggest relief.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>'s F-4 Phantom jet had been escorting a bomber when it collided with another plane in 1967. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> dedicated its first memorial to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, a bronze sculpture near the Capitol in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submariner <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> recalled how he helped rescue five airmen shot down in two planes 44 years ago about 70 miles off <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. One of the men was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Sure, I'm proud of that,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 76. `` I'm happy that at the same time we also rescued four other guys.'' And in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an 88-year-old World War I veteran, showed up at the city veterans monument for what originally was intended to be a posthumous memorial service for him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, wearing his uniform and medals as participants laid wreaths and played taps in honor of the day, joked about the mistake. `` I do n't know how it came about, but I'm making the most of it,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I'm glad to be alive and around.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> promised four religious political parties his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc would change a law defining who is a Jew, if they join <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> in a new government. The leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc made the pledge Friday, despite vocal opposition by Jewish leaders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries who object to amending the law and say that would divide the Jewish people. The controverisal law defines who is recognized as Jewish by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and it automatically confers citizenship on Jews who emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The proposed ammendment says immigrants converted to Judaism by Reform or Conservatives rabbis would not be regarded as Jews by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities and woud be ineligible for citizenship. The ammendment would only honor conversions conducted by Orthodox rabbis. `` Prime Minister <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the religious parties he is sure he can pass the law within three months of the new government,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON>. `` It's not ideal, but the silent majority -LRB- of Jews abroad -RRB- will accept it with understanding,'' <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament in the Nov. 1 elections _ more than the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> party's 39 seats but not enough to form a majority. Although the right-wing party has the support of three far-right parties, which together carry seven seats, it still needs the support of the religious bloc's 18 seats to form a majority. Rabbi <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON>, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s promise satisfied him and he favored joining the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> government. `` It is possible to say we got a satisfying answer,'' <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> said Friday afternoon. Jews abroad, the majority of whom are not Orthodox, have been vocal in their opposition to the amendment. The amendment has tremendous symbolic meaning by implying the the non-Orthodox streams of Judaism are not legitimate. However, <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON> said the change in legislation would have little practical effect. `` Even without the change in the law the -LRB- non-Orthodox Jews -RRB- do not come to live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by the masses,'' <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON> said. `` The majority who come are the Orthodox Jews.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also met Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the ultra-Orthodox Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Degel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatorah </PERSON> parties. Rabbi <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitz </PERSON> of <PERSON> Degel </PERSON> said he was pleased by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s pledge. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> already is supporting <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. Other religious parties are scheduled to meet with President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> next week to make recommendations for the prime minister's post. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> will then ask the party leader most likely to form a coalition to head the next government.

<HEAD>Muddle at Met in Season's First `Carmen'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was a cockeyed `` Carmen'' at the Metropolitan Opera: the tenor who should have been on stage spent the night in the orchestra pit, and the soprano who sang a supporting role far outshone the female lead. But <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Bizet </PERSON>'s masterpiece has survived far worse treatment than it received Friday night in the season's first performance of a production created 2 -LCB- years ago by Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> for his wife, mezzo-soprano <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>. Her performance as the fiery gypsy who refuses to give up her freedom received mixed reviews at the time and she is no longer appearing in the production. In her place was Argentinean mezzo <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nafe </PERSON>, making her Met debut. Despite a pleasant voice, she did not make much of an impression in the cavernous house, lacking the power and vocal thrust to bring <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>'s many haunting melodies to life. In the pivotal Card Scene of Act 3, when <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> learns she is doomed, the voices of fellow gypsies Frasquita and Mercedes all but drowned her out. By contrast, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Studer </PERSON>, a soprano from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> making her debut as <PERSON> Micaela </PERSON>, established herself immediately as a major artist. She could throttle up the volume with ease without sounding harsh or strident, and it's no surprise that she has been performing major Wagnerian roles in leading opera houses. Let's hope the Met puts her to better use soon. Now to the tenors. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakes </PERSON>, a hulking Texan who sang a first-rate <PERSON> Siegmund </PERSON> in <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Die Walkuere'' last year, was a rough, unidiomatic <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>. At this point in his career he simply lacks the grace _ vocal or physical _ to carry off the role of the naive soldier who falls fatally in love with <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>. And all the while, a few feet away with a baton in his hand was one of the world's foremost <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Joses </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>, who is developing a second career as a conductor as insurance against the day when his tenor voice fades. The problem is that at this point he is still a great tenor but not a great conductor. He put the orchestra through its paces conscientiously but failed to bring out much of the passion or pessimism of this wondrous score. The fourth major character, the dashing toreador <PERSON> Escamillo </PERSON>, was sung by another debutant, French baritone <PERSON> Jean-Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafont </PERSON>. He proved a lively performer, but like most baritones who attempt this role, he could n't do justice to the low notes of the famous `` Toreador Song.'' The production, with sets and costumes by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bury </PERSON>, has its strong points, especially Act 3, a striking depiction of the smuggler's mountain hideout. This `` Carmen'' will undergo numerous cast changes as the season wears on. Some later peformances will star <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> in the title role, and <PERSON> Mirella </PERSON> <PERSON> Freni </PERSON> will sing <PERSON> Micaela </PERSON> twice.

<TEXT>
 Opposition leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, on what he calls the crusade of a lifetime to halt the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, is whipping up campaign fervor with his attacks and clearly loving it. For him, Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> sold out <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and became the `` head waiter at the White House'' by signing the pact with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January. At a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rally, a crowd of about 2,300 howled in approval when <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> imitated the prime minister, saluting and saying `` Yes, sir!'' to every one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s requests. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> wants to be `` governor of the 51st state,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> says. Turner wants to be the prime minister of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` This election is a referendum on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s future,'' Turner repeats at nearly every stop on his campaign for the Nov. 21 vote. The potent, single-minded message of Canadian nationalism has revived the Liberals' campaign and put them in a dead heat with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won by a landslide in 1984. It was n't very long ago that Liberal rallies were attracting handfuls of loyal supporters, not standing-room-only crowds. `` I can sense the momentum; I can sense it,'' the exuberant, silver-haired <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> yelled to his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> audience. A rock band played repeatedly the `` Go Johnny Go'' refrain of <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s `` Johnny B Good.'' When the campaign began in October, polls showed the Liberals could slip to third place behind <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>. But a poll published Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail indicated the Liberals were leading with 37 percent support, compared to 35 percent for the Conservatives and 24 percent for the New Democrats. The poll, by the <ORGANIZATION> Environics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, had a margin of error of 2.7 percent. Perhaps in a mark of Turner's increased popularity, hecklers now appear at almost every stop to shout out that he is misrepresenting the free trade agreement. At <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, most were business students from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION>. Only a Conservative majority will ensure the survival of the free trade agreement, which would eliminate tariffs between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> over a 10-year period beginning Jan. 1. The Liberals and the New Democrats oppose the deal, which has already been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It ca n't take effect until <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> also approves it. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> argues that the pact is needed to guarantee Canadian access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets at a time of rising international protectionism. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> argues that the agreement is too drastic a break from 120 years of Canadian history marked by resistance to pressures from the giant neighbor to the south. He insists he does not oppose free trade and is not anti-American, but says the pact simply gives away too much by not recognizing the huge discrepancy in size and economic power between <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On the campaign trail, he talks about preserving `` the Canadian way _ not somebody else's way; not the American way.'' Turner stopped at farms to dramatize his message that Canadian farmers, with their long winters and short growing seasons, would be harmed by open competition with their southern counterparts. He visited an auto parts plant and espoused his view that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would be better served by taking a sector-by-sector approach to trade _ such as the auto pact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that has fueled <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>'s prosperity _ rather than agreeing to one sweeping deal. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> says his opponents are `` scare mongering'' with false and irrational arguments that the agreement would force <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to modify its system of strong social and health protection for its people. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already form the world's biggest two-nation trading partnership with more than $ 130 billion a year passing between them. Opponents of the free trade agreement note that 80 percent of the trade already is tariff-free. The deal's supporters, however, respond that it is deceptive to speak of it as affecting only the remaining 20 percent of current trade because they say the agreement will fuel growth to previously unimaginable levels.

<HEAD>Police Say Fake Doctor Operated `Brilliant' Jewel Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police are looking for a man who ripped off at least nine people in a carefully crafted swindle in which he posed as a doctor and used fake cashier's checks to buy $ 150,000 in jewelry. `` He's cool, calm and collected,'' said <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. `` I've seen a lot of scams, but this one is brilliant.'' The con artist dressed in a white doctor's coat, gave out cards identifying himself as <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, M.D., and met his victims in hospital lobbies, police say. He looked 45 to 55 years old, with dark hair edged with gray, glasses and an expensive suit. One couple needing to raise money placed a classified ad to sell 31 pieces of jewelry. A man responded to the ad and arranged to meet them in the lobby of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` He said he was due in surgery. And sure enough, in a few minutes, his name came over the intercom,'' said the 50-year-old woman, whose name was not released. The doctor gave the couple a cashier's check for $ 17,000 and hustled off to surgery. The check bounced. The man conned four other victims at the same hospital in one hour. At <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, he scammed four people in three hours. His last hit was Oct. 24 in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>. `` What better scenario for this guy _ a hospital!'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Karekos </PERSON>, 54, who sold a gold Rolex watch to finance home remodeling. `` I tell you, this guy looked like a doctor.'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> salesman, sold two rings for $ 3,000. `` If you saw this guy, you'd think he's a doctor,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` I'm not embarrassed by it.

<TEXT>
 In 68 days, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will turn over the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but in reality the transfer of power already is underway. The clock is quickly running out on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, so <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments are searching for clues about what the next man will do. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will be at the White House this week for farewell meetings with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. They also want to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has quit for the year and wo n't be back until January, foreclosing the possibility of any last-minute initiatives for lawmakers from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Meanwhile, a transition team named by the newly elected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is developing legislative strategy and priorities for the first 100 days of his presidency, a period regarded as crucial for setting the right tone for a new administration. Out of the less than 10 weeks remaining in his presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to spend three weeks on vacation in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He will send a final budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early next year but it wo n't get a second look unless lawmakers are assured it really represents what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants done. `` The president-elect gets all the attention,'' said <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, newly named personnel chief for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team. `` The incumbent president is the one that people have to be reminded of.'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> hastened to add that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be an exception to the rule. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said, `` It is ironic that our Constitution now provides automatically for up to 10 weeks of crippled leadership each time the presidency of our nation changes hands through elections.'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> has proposed a constitutional amendment to move up the inauguration to Nov. 20 instead of Jan. 20 but his measure has generated little interest. Of course, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is still in charge for the next 2 -LCB- months. `` The whole presidency is like an hourglass and there are very few sands left in the top of the hourglass,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, senior fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` But nevertheless if something should happen, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has the authority and is the president until Jan. 20.'' Some senior members of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration already have quit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet and more than 500 top political appointees are being asked to submit their resignations, effective at the pleasure of the president. That will spare <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the unpleasantness of having to ask them to leave when he takes over Jan. 20. In the top ranks, a lucky few will be asked to stay, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised a major overhaul to reinvigorate the government. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is expected to be asked this week to remain in his post. Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> are considered possible holdovers. Throughout the ranks of government, the jobs of about 5,000 political appointees could change hands. Many of those jobs will be determined at a secretarial level or lower, and will not cross the president's desk. `` It's not quite as horrifying as it may seem,'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said. `` It's in the hundreds rather than the thousands that really matter.'' With $ 3.25 million provided by taxpayers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team set up shop on 3 -LCB- floors of an office building in <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION>, not far from the White House. In addition to combing through personnel resumes and planning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s agenda, the staff also is charged with drafting an organizational plan for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, drawing lines of authority within the executive branch. To help them with their work, transition planners have at their disposal a computer system that is compatible with the one at the White House, so they can easily take their work with them on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already is ahead of schedule in starting to name his Cabinet. On the morning after his election he said that longtime friend <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would be his secretary of state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would like to get the whole Cabinet named `` sooner rather than way late.'' In the modern presidency, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> was the earliest to begin naming his Cabinet and also was the first to complete the job. He started on Nov. 20 and was finished by Dec. 1. The latest to get started were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who waited until Dec. 11 to begin naming Cabinet members. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was the latest to finish, naming his last <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member _ Education Secretary <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> _ on Jan. 8. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won the presidency in 1980, his transition team swelled to about 1,500 people. <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> describes the transition from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency is `` a friendly takeover,'' and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants `` a somewhat leaner transition organization than we had in 1980.'' The Reagan-Bush transition is unique. Not since 1929 _ when <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> was succeeded by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> _ has a president turned over the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to a member of his own party. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that makes his job easier. `` You do n't have to send teams out to every agency. I know enough about how the government works. We're on the same general direction,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have to go out and reinvent the wheel.''

<HEAD>Fire Damages Building Where Tutu Peace Lecture To Be Given</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A fire set by arsonists damaged a university building today where the annual <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> Peace Lecture was to be delivered, police and student leaders said. The building, which was painted with anti-Tutu slogans, also houses the offices of a multiracial, anti-apartheid organization. The offices were heavily damaged by the fire and files were stolen, police said. A detonator, fuse and a flammable liquid were used to set fire to the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Students in the building at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police said. Sprinklers doused the fire, but flooded the building, damaging corridors, lecture halls and equipment in the classrooms, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, spokesman for the student organization. Also today, police reported a limpet mine explosion damaged a railway track near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday night and a black man was shot to death by an unidentified gunman in the <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province township of <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION>. The fire caused an estimated $ 240,000 damage to the building. Graffiti attacking <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Anglican archbishop, was painted on the outside of the building where an annual peace lecture bearing his name was to be delivered tonight. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was invited to attend, but was not planning to, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the name of the speaker, British Rabbi <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON>, was printed in small letters on posters, and `` <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> Peace Lecture'' was in large block letters, possibly leading to the impression that he was to appear. A police spokesman, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Malherbe </PERSON>, said the fire was being investigated by a criminal division of the police force. He said a phone recording machine and some files had been removed from the offices of the student organization but that neither security police nor the criminal investigators had removed anything. He said police believed the same persons were responsible for the arson, the graffiti and the thefts. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kromberg </PERSON>, national president of the student group, said the attack `` is obviously aimed at intimidating us and disrupting our anti-apartheid work. `` The bombing of our offices follows a string of attacks on other anti-apartheid organizations. ... The police do not seem to have made much progress with these cases and we hope that they will treat this case with the seriousness it deserves.'' <PERSON> Malherbe </PERSON> said the detonator and fuse found at the scene had been used to light the fire, and not for explosive purposes. `` At this stage it's being treated as an ordinary arson,'' he said. Police gave no details on the death <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>, where at least 1,000 people have died in the past two years in fighting between black political groups for control of the townships. Police said they did not know when the limpet mine had exploded on the railway line near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, but the damage, and a second, unexploded mine, were discovered today. Services were not interrupted, said transport spokesman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Toit </PERSON>. Censorship rules imposed under the 29-month-old state of emergency ban or restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, most forms of peaceful protest and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the stooped and aging `` father'' of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, brings to the nation's capital a dramatic reminder of the plight of dissidents in his country but also how their burden has been eased by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> At 67, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist speaks for Soviet dissidents and sometimes for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He is an outspoken supporter of perestroika, the attempt to reconstruct the ailing Soviet economy, but he has pleaded the case of dissidents and has questioned the power <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> derives from dual control of the Communist party and the government. `` A head of state with such powers in a country that does not have a multiparty system is just insanity,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said at a press conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> before embarking on his first trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> stands as an ardent spokesman for political prisoners and other dissidents, listing those <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should free. The Soviet leader complies with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s requests, but the world's most celebrated human rights activist keeps pushing, complimenting and criticizing A non-Jew, he is the symbol of Soviet Jews' clamoring to emigrate, and of Armenians and other ethnic groups, as well. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> seeks to make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a kinder, gentler nation, and to expand political and religious freedom. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> both has praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s actions as `` deserving of respect,'' thereby burnishing the Soviet President's image in the West, and demanded more for the activists who remain in prison or in psychiatric institutions. He has lobbied for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before journalists crowded into his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment and has spoken in the Soviet leader's behalf to international audiences. His praise of perestroika gives economic reform a credibility in the West derived from <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s reputation for independence. Two years ago, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> became a free man. At <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s direction, the Politburo ended his virtual house arrest in <LOCATION> Gorki </LOCATION>, an industrial city 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> where he had been sent in 1980 for criticizing the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and emigration restrictions and allegedly defaming the state <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who won the Nobel prize in 1975 for his human rights activism, will be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> through Wednesday primarily to attend meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>, a Moscow-based group that supports research into such diverse fields as arms control, environmental protection and energy and claims to be independent of all governments. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign service officer and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staffer who heads the foundation's American office, said Saturday the month-old group was established by a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> decree. `` The presence of academician <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a direct consequence of the foundation's new legitimacy,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The American executive director said all the problems the foundation seeks to resolve require cooperation. `` <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has been in the forefront on these concerns for over 20 years,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The chairman is <PERSON> Yevgenii </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, a physicist and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The vice-chairman is <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Other board members include former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, the petroleum company executive. The foundation, operating with dollars and rubles, plans to make grants for projects that require international cooperation and make recommendations to lending institutions and political leaders. For the American public, the highlights of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s visit will be his meeting Monday with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Wednesday with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the speeches and news conferences he will hold. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> receives the 1988 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> peace prize and $ 50,000 award. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, chairman of the selection board, described <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as `` a person whose life proves that a single individual can truly make an enormous impact on the conscience of the world.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, in defending <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reconstruction program, has stressed its success would ease security concerns. `` The failures of perestroika,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said, `` would make expansion a political necessity and the country would be extremely dangerous in terms of world balance.''

<HEAD>Thirteen Killed In Ethnic Violence; Fuel Workers Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 13 people were killed in a wave of ethnic violence, officials said Saturday, and a fuel workers' strike called by a radical Sinhalese group raised fears of severe food shortages. A military official said four people were killed and 20 others, including 16 schoolchildren, were injured when a car bomb exploded near <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION>, 185 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Friday. The official, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the victims were all minority Tamils. The bombing was blamed on members of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, a militant group fighting for an independent Tamil homeland on the island's north and east. The official said the car bomb might have been aimed at Indian troops, posted in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to quell the Tamil rebellion, and that it probably exploded prematurely. The bodies of five Tamils abducted Friday were found Saturday in the town of <LOCATION> Kalumnai </LOCATION>, 136 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the official said. The killings were blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, the largest and most powerful of the Tamil militias. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are at the forefront of the Tamils' 5-year-old war for a separate state. The rebels say a Tamil homeland is needed to combat alleged discrimination by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s majority Sinhalese. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Sinhalese group, were blamed for killing four government supporters in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on Saturday. The military official said four Sinhalese, including the brother of a government lawmaker and three of his supporters, were killed in a car ambush at the town of <LOCATION> Kurunegala </LOCATION>, 52 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, a strike by fuel workers led to gasoline shortages and a breakdown in the distribution of food, authorities said. Sufficient food supplies have been sent to the southern port town of <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, but gasoline shortages prevented distribution to other towns in the region, Food Commissioner <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON> said. About 2,500 employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the island nation's only supplier of gasoline, walked off the job Monday in response to a strike call by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is demanding the resignation of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> on Friday issued an emergency decree that mandated death by hanging for people convicted of instigating strikes or refusing to report for work in `` essential services'' sectors, such as fuel and transportation. This strikes were the latest in a series called by the front, which opposes <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s peace overtures to Tamil rebels. It says it wo n't be satisfied until the president resigns. Presidential elections are scheduled Dec. 19, but the front claims the <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> government is incapable of conducting a fair vote. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term in the election.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Orders Use Of ID Cards In Pakistani Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ordered that Pakistani voters must show identification cards before casting ballots in the November elections for the national and provincial legislatures. The 12-member court issued an injunction blocking a lower court ruling on Tuesday that rejected the ID requirement, which had been challenged by the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is led by <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. The party claimed many of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s 48 million eligible voters do not have ID cards, especially women who refuse to be photographed according to Moslem religious laws that require women to veil their faces in public. The government said that about 93 percent of the electorate have the cards, but the lower court found that in some districts records showed there are more ID cards than eligible voters. The government appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the grounds that identity cards are the only way to prevent fraud at polling stations. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it issued the injunction because there was n't enough time to consider the government's appeal before the Nov. 16 elections for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the Nov. 19 elections for the provincial legislatures.

<HEAD>Dukakis Faulted for Running Unresponsive, Aloof and Parochial
Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At the end, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he'd learned something in his failure: `` One of the lessons of the campaign is you have to respond and you have to respond quickly.'' Some who had campaigned for him groaned when they heard it. If this was the lesson, it was one they had learned long before and had tried repeatedly to tell <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his high command. `` That's the first lesson of ward politics,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> political consultant brought in late in the campaign as an adviser. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was faulted all fall for his failure to respond to strong attacks on his record from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. In the last weeks of his campaign, he acknowledged that he had dallied too long. His failure to respond was, most observers believe, a large reason he was unsuccessful. But it was not the full story of why the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> failed as Democratic presidential nominee. Rather, it reflected a larger problem: a candidate and campaign that were aloof and parochial _ and, many felt, arrogant. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his campaign badly underestimated their opponent. They resisted outside advice until it was too late. They failed to find a message and voice until the race had been lost, and in fact had no effective strategy after winning the nomination. They squandered months delivering little more than bland bromides. And they failed utterly to recognize the devastating impact the other side's attacks were having, even as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' image was being undermined. `` They did n't know people,'' said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Young was referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' advisers and consultants. But interviews with those inside the campaign suggest the same might well be said of the candidate himself. A number of top campaign staffers _ including manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, top strategist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, political aides <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> _ are all named as finger-pointing goes on in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> distraught at its latest failure. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> in particular is blamed by some in the party for allowing the campaign's summer aimlessness, and for her <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> approach to hot-button issues. What stands out in memory from the long <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign are missed opportunities by a team unprepared for the rough and tumble of a general election campaign: _ Before the convention, beginning to feel the Republicans' needles, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded with breathtaking naivete that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should `` stop criticizing others _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> let pass the opportunity to address defense and foreign policy matters in a substantive way early on, when he could have inoculated himself against coming attacks _ Day after day through the summer and much of the fall, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> virtually conceded the evening television news stories and the next day's newspaper stories to the other side <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> never seemed to adjust to his role as a national figure on a national stage. He and his campaign were consumed by what was in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> press, even in the campaign's final days _ a reflection, it seemed, of his insulated and confined view. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> once remarked that no ads went out of his campaign without his personal approval. But his campaign was effectively paralyzed, unable to mount a cogent television campaign. Republican strategists made no secret of their plans to try to damage <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record and reputation. In the spring and summer they even pointed to the prison furlough and Pledge of Allegiance issues they would exploit. Yet when it came, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign seemed ill prepared. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hammered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, some within the campaign grew angry at their own inability to respond. Even <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> complained. `` Everybody was frustrated by the unwillingness to deal with it,'' said one campaign official, insisting on anonymity. As a result, campaign staffers out in the field sometimes worked around <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his campaign hierarchy. In some states they secretly printed and circulated tough ads and brochures that were n't approved by the headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ `` a bootleg counter-slash,'' one official called it <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his top campaign officials in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> did n't seem to understand the values and symbolism behind those issues <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had chosen. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed to assume that the nation knew him as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters did. `` He could not believe that the son of immigrants could ever be spun around on the Pledge of Allegiance,'' said <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. `` Because <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't see himself as a liberal, he could n't say what he was n't.'' The result was that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, after carefully crafting a candidacy based on moderation and problem-solving, came to be seen as something culturally different to much of the country. He never looked like a fighter until the last couple weeks, when he finally found a populist theme that connected with voters and the ability to say it convincingly. But by then it was too late, and he was just fighting to avoid embarrassment.

<HEAD>Government Bill Accepts Idea Of Multiparty System `In Principle'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has approved draft legislation that allows a multiparty political system in principle but does not include the framework for independent parties, the justice minister was quoted as saying today. The draft bill was approved by the Communist government Thursday and goes before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> later this month. It refers to the right of individuals and groups to establish political parties. `` While the text recognizes the possibility of organizing political parties, it also stipulates that they can not be organized on the basis of this law on association,'' the Communist daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> quoted Justice Minister <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulcsar </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Kulcsar </PERSON> was quoted as saying a separate law _ not likely to be ready before 1990 _ will set up guidelines and regulate the establishment of political parties. There has been extensive debate in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in recent months over the feasibility of a multiparty system. Dozens of independent groups have formed, many with political platforms that are seen as a nucleus of a party. Under the draft bill, `` A multiparty system is acceptable in principle while its concrete realization requires a transitional period,'' <PERSON> Kulcsar </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Leaders of independent groups have been cautious about expressing too much optimism over the announcement of the party reference in the draft bill. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Joo </PERSON>, a member of the independent Democratic Forum _ with a membership of some 7,000 _ described it as `` a step forward on the way to democratization, but it was announced in such a contradictory manner that it limits our enthusiasm for it.'' But he said that after 40 years of single party rule, `` -LRB- new -RRB- parties can not appear from one day to the next.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, chief ideologist of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that politcal reforms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is a long-term process. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leadership under <ORGANIZATION> Comnunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has permitted more openness in the media. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> also backs strict austerity measures, including personal income taxes, to help reduce the foreign debt and to stimulate the stagnating economy.

<TEXT>
 About 200 leftist guerrillas hurled bombs and fired automatic weapons at a northern mining town and its military base, and a provincial governor said today that 34 people were killed and 31 wounded. The guerrillas threw the bombs at the telephone company, town hall and a crowded square Friday night in <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>, who described the assault in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> radio. The town is 180 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The blasts destroyed the telephone company and caused the civilian injuries, he told the radio. Guerrillas also fired automatic weapons. `` There has never been an attack so bloody and so cruel, especially directed against the civilian population,'' <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> told the radio in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. It was the deadliest guerrilla attack in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> since Aug. 23, when 42 people were killed _ 12 civilians, 12 police and military and 18 guerrillas _ in a raid in the town of <LOCATION> Saiza </LOCATION>, 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> said all those killed in <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION> were civilians and rebels of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> said the guerrillas, who arrived by car, caused vast destruction to the base and the mining town of 15,000 people. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units from the base, at the edge of town, repelled the attackers after the hourlong raid, <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> said. There were no military casualties, said <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>, who provided no details on the attack on the base. `` I lament this episode, which left so many dead and so many famalies in mourning,'' he told the radio.

 The commander of the communist rebel army escaped from prison today with his wife after slipping away from a birthday party for the former commandant of their stockade, officials said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Cresencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, said the military sealed off approaches to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> escaped from the home of Maj. <PERSON> Robelito </PERSON> <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON> at Camp Crame, a suburban military camp which includes the stockade. <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON> said he had invited <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and other prisoners to attend his birthday party. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Pantaleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON>, senior officer on duty at Camp Crame, said in a report that <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was released from his cell about noon and was escorted to <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>'s home in the camp for the party. According to the report, <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and the guard left the party about two hours later and returned to the stockade. But a short time later, <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, his wife and another prisoner went back with the same guard to <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said about 3 p.m., the other prisoner asked to be escorted back to the stockade. The guard walked the prisoner back to his cell and then returned to <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>'s home to fetch the other prisoners. When the guard returned, <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife had vanished, <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said. There was no explanation why <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>'s home. The report also did not say how many people attended. <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> said <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON> and the acting stockade commander, Maj. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrito </PERSON>, were confined to quarters and the guard was jailed pending an investigation. <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> described <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife as `` maximum security prisoners'' but had no explanation why they were released from their cells for a party. <PERSON> Landrito </PERSON> said he was asleep in his office during the escape and that he never gave permission for <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and other inmates to attend the party. <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON> was temporarily relieved of his post as prison commandant pending an investigation into last month's killing of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Baula </PERSON> at the same stockade. Prison guards claimed <PERSON> Baula </PERSON>, who was a leader of the Aug. 28, 1987 failed coup attempt against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, was shot while trying to escape. His relatives claim he was murdered. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife were arrested in March in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> along with <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylosis </PERSON>, alleged secretary-general of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The military hailed the arrest as a major blow to the rebels. The military said <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was commander of the 25,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was widely believed to have organized assassination squads responsible for killing scores of police and soldiers. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was the latest government opponent to escape military custody. In April, the leader of the August 1987 coup attempt, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, escaped from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> with the help of his guards. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> remains at large. A few days later, a <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> confederate, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON>, escaped after being allowed to leave his cell to visit a dentist. He was arrested in September.

 There they go again, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might say before he turns out the lights in the Oval Office on his way back to the ranch. The same people who said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> would defeat <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for the White House this fall are making odds on how quickly President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have his legislative agenda chewed up by an implacably hostile <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The argument goes this way: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected after a campaign based largely on distortions of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record, was extremely skimpy on the specifics and he does n't have much of a chance against congressional leaders who won just as big at the polls as he did. `` His problem is going to be that there's going to be virtually no honeymoon,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, a well-known conservative who worked for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. It might turn out that way, and it is worth noting that 1988 is the first election in 28 years in which a president of one party was elected while the opposition party gained seats in the House. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did devote a lot of attention in his campaign to attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on highly emotional issues such as crime, without providing many details of his `` flexible freeze'' or his call for a `` kinder, gentler nation.'' One of the lines best remembered _ read my lips, no new taxes _ will be put to the test, no doubt. But the conventional wisdom turned out to be wrong in the crunch as often as not during the campaign that ended on Tuesday. Remember the experts who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy would unravel swiftly after <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> defeated him in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s Republican caucuses? It did _ until the next election eight days later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> that doomed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The same experts said none of the announced Democratic candidates could ever win the nomination, and that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> would sweep the convention. But they were wrong. Among the reasons <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the White House this year, as campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is fond of saying, is that his enemies consistently underestimated him. Also, his inner circle was far superior to anyone else's. The same team that patiently plotted the post-convention political blitz that sent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> surging past <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now has 10 weeks to plan a fast getaway from the new administration. There's no reason to think it wo n't be done with the same thoroughness. For all the talk of a mandate for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the senators and representatives also know that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won 40 states, many of them by substantial margins. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has signalled his hopes for a constructive relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: _ He conspicuously avoided saying he had a mandate when he fielded questions from reporters on Wednesday. `` I'm going to do everything I can to have good and open and friendly relationships with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And I do n't want us to talk at each other. I want us to talk to each other,'' he later added. _ Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the first appointee, is highly regarded by congressional leaders who know him as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first-term chief of staff and then as treasury secretary. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is widely expected to ask <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to stay on as treasury secretary in the new government. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who served several months as an appointed senator, was swiftly confirmed for his Cabinet post. _ Asked at his news conference whether his injunction against taxes included all so-called revenue enhancements, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ducked. He noted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had criticized him for supporting an increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premiums to finance catastrophic health care coverage. `` You'll have to define what you mean,'' he added. No matter what the experts predict, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a president sometimes have a way of working together when least expected. Like this year. The election-year <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that adjourned last month and the most conservative president in a generation _ a lame duck to boot _ agreed on a bill to combat drug abuse, an overhaul of welfare laws, a trade bill, a plant closing bill and also agreed on all 13 individual appropriations bill for the first time in many years.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators jammed central <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Saturday in a huge protest called by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s trade unions over the government's tax policies. Estimates by union organizers, witnesses, news agencies and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television put the turnout at 300,000 to 400,000. The protesters, who came from all over <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by special trains and buses, marched past the Colosseum and converged in the square in front of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lateran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. There, they waved banners, chanted slogans and listened to speeches by the leaders of the three main trade unions. The speakers said the unions, which are joined in a confederation, would consider calling a nationwide general strike unless the government acts on their demands. The unions are demanding fiscal reforms on grounds that the present tax system favors tax evaders and unfairly penalizes workers and retirees. They dubbed the demonstration `` the march of the honest ones.'' The crowd chanted `` We already pay, it's time that everybody pays!'' and carried placards and signs with slogans such as `` Handcuffs for tax evaders and their protectors.'' `` On the fiscal side, we should all be equal in the eye of the state and pay taxes in relation to what we possess,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzinato </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Communist-dominated General Confederation of Italian Workers. `` That's not the way it is today under the existing structure,'' he told the crowd. `` There are those who pay everything on everything and those are the workers and the retirees. And there are those who evade or pay minimal amounts.'' <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>, leader of the Socialist-led <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION>, said the state lost the equivalent of $ 40 billion in revenue from tax evasion in 1988 _ `` an insult to those honest taxpayers.'' The union leaders are scheduled to meet soon with parliamentarians who are debating the proposed 1989 national budget.

<TEXT>
 The nuclear-powered attack submarine <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was launched Saturday while opponents of nuclear weapons demonstrated outside the Electric Boat shipyard. The Los Angeles-class vessel was `` symbolic of the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can produce,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first sub launched at the Electric Boat shipyard since the end of a bitter, three-month strike by the shipyard's 10,000 blue-collar workers. The walkout ended Oct. 11 with the ratification of a new contract. The only reference to the strike was made by shipyard General Manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who said the launch `` reaffirms the ability of this company to withstand and recover from its difficulty.'' About 35 members of an anti-nuclear weapons group, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Stop the Trident, staged a demonstration outside the shipyard, which also makes Trident missile-carrying subs. Demonstrators carried signs with such messages as, `` What about the children?'' Police said there were no arrests. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobasa </PERSON>, a protest organizer, said the demonstration was a warmup for a major effort that will start with the Dec. 17 launch of the Trident submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The effort will conclude on <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s birthday in January with a `` major civil disobedience action'' at Electric Boat, <PERSON> Kobasa </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> will have to undergo about a year of tests before it is determined ready for active duty. The 360-foot-long sub eventually will be equipped with anti-submarine torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles. It will carry a crew of 12 officers and 115 enlisted men. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 39 attack submarines in the same class as the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Electric Boat, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has produced 23 of them and has contracts for eight more.

<TEXT>
 The commander of the Communist rebel army escaped from prison Saturday after he was let out of his cell to attend a birthday party for the former prison warden, officials said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Cresencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON>, said the military flashed a nationwide alarm and sealed off approaches to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON>, fled about 3 p.m. from the home of Maj. <PERSON> Robelito </PERSON> <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife were arrested in March. The military says <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> is commander of the 25,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was widely believed to be the chief organizer of communist assassination squads responsible for killing scores of police and soldiers. He is the third prominent government opponent to escape military custody. <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>, the former warden at the military stockade, invited <PERSON> Kitanar </PERSON> and other prisoners to his party at his home at Camp Crame. The prison is on the grounds of Camp Crame. <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> told reporters an investigation was under way because <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was a `` maximum security prisoner'' who should not have been allowed outside his cell without a guard. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Pantaleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON>, senior officer on duty Saturday at Camp Crame, said <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was released from his cell about noon and escorted to <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>'s home. According to the report, <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and the guard left the party about two hours later and returned to stockade. Later, <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, his wife and another rebel prisoner, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Madlos </PERSON>, went back with the same guard to <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>'s party. <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said that at about 3 p.m., <PERSON> Madlos </PERSON> asked to be taken back to the stockade. Constable <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acma </PERSON> walked <PERSON> Madlos </PERSON> back to his cell but when he returned to the party, <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife were gone, <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said several guards were arrested and Comilang and the acting prison commander, Maj. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrito </PERSON>, were detained. The general gave no explanation why <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> returned to the party a second time. <PERSON> Landrito </PERSON> said he did not not give permission for <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> to leave the cell the second time because `` I was in my office, sleeping.'' `` The only time I knew about the escape of <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife was when they woke me up at 3:15,'' <PERSON> Landrito </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview late Saturday. <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON> was temporarily relieved of his post as prison commandant pending an investigation into last month's killing of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Baula </PERSON> at the stockade. Prison guards claimed <PERSON> Baula </PERSON>, a leader of the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, was shot while trying to escape. His relatives claim he was murdered. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> and his wife were arrested in March in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> along with <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylosis </PERSON>, the alleged secretary-general of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The military hailed the arrests as a major blow to the rebel movement. The Camp Crame prison houses about 160 prisoners, including both <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels and right-wing extremists jailed in connection with coup attempts against the Aquino government. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> was the latest prominent opponent of the Aquino government to escape military custody. In April, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of the August coup attempt, escaped from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> with the help of his guards. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> remains at large. A few days later, a <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> confederate, Lt.

<HEAD>Studies Disagree On Danger To Neighbors of Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For years, neighbors of nuclear plants have worried about cancer. Although some research suggests that just living near a plant may increase the risk of leukemia from radiation, other scientific studies indicate that such small doses of low-level radiation pose small risk. Concern over nuclear contamination has been growing as the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> discloses more and more problems at the nuclear weapons production plants that it runs in 13 states. The department has said it will cost up to $ 110 billion to clean up environmental contamination at 17 major plants. Those plants `` constitute a public health emergency,'' said Dr. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, a medical professor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and spokesman for the anti-nuclear group, Physicians for Social Responsibility. <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, calling the weapons complex a `` creeping Chernobyl,'' is urging the federal government to commission extensive studies of the effect of radiation from the plants on surrounding populations. In fact, the federal government has spent about $ 2 billion sponsoring dozens of studies on nuclear workers and neighbors, but has come up without a clear picture of the health risks. Research is hampered by shifts in population near nuclear plants and problems measuring exactly how much radiation people are exposed to. Moreover, the rate of excess cancer is hard to determine against a national population in which, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an estimated one out of three Americans will eventually have cancer. `` The whole situation is rather puzzling,'' said <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jablon </PERSON>, an expert at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>. `` The only thing that is really sticking its head up is leukemia,'' especially among children. To gain a clearer picture of the risks, the cancer institute is harnessing a mainframe computer to study health, mortality and morbidity data from 127 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counties which host or are next to nuclear power plants or weapons processing facilities. The results will be compared with rates from 400 other counties not near reactors. The project began last January and results are expected by the end of next summer, said <PERSON> Jablon </PERSON>. Several studies of populations near <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> reactors have showed higher than average rates of leukemia and other types of cancers, and some studies of workers at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, show higher than average rates for some types of cancers. Another study of children in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> exposed to fallout from atomic tests in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> 1951 to 1958 showed a higher rate of leukemia. But the results of those studies have been disputed by other researchers, and some scientists say they do not present a general pattern that would prove nuclear plants pose a threat. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has been scathingly critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s safety and environmental practices, reviewed many of those studies and concluded in a two-volume report in 1981 that `` there is as yet no way to determine precisely the cancer risks of low-level ionizing radiation and it is unlikely that this question will be resolved soon.'' For workers at nuclear plants, generally exposed to higher levels of radiation than nearby residents, `` the most general statement we can say is that overall mortality is similar to or better than the general population,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON>, head of epidemiologic research at <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which is conducting research under contract for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have seen in several populations an elevation of one type of cancer or another, but there is no pattern,'' she said. Scientists may have trouble measuring exposure rates among nuclear neighbors, but the government now admits some cases of extensive radiation release. One of the grimmest was the release in December 1949 of massive amounts of radioactive iodine 131 from the Hanford plant. The so-called `` green run'' apparently was intended to help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials develop means of tracking suspected radiation leaks from the Soviet nuclear weapons program. June Stark <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, in 1949, said that after the release she became weak and began to lose hair. `` My parents spent thousands of dollars taking me from doctor to doctor. Although these are common effects of overexposure to radiation, the cause did n't occur to my parents because the releases were kept secret,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. The links between cancer and high levels of radiation are better documented, most convincingly in studies of 50,000 survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. Among those exposed to massive doses of radiation from the bombs, researchers found 480 excess cancers, including about 100 leukemias, followed by cancers of the lung, stomach, colon, female breast and thyroid, said <PERSON> Jablon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The lack of persuasive scientific data has not persuaded critics that no link exists between low-level radiation doses and cancer. `` They do n't have good data. The means they have to measure disease are too crude, and what they are looking for is subtle. But that does n't mean that we do n't have problems,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and an active critic of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, marking his last Veterans' Day as president, said today he leaves office gratified that `` once again our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their country. The president delivered his weekly radio address from Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to which he flew Friday after Veterans' Day observances at the Tomb of the Unknowns at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> and at the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. His remarks echoed a note he has sounded often in recent weeks as he campaigned for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican candidate who was elected Tuesday as his successor. `` On this, the last Veterans' Day I will commemorate as president, I would like to say that if there is one change <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I made that touches me most profoundly it would probably be this: once again our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their country.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not elaborate on the remark, but has often boasted that his administration began rebuilding American military might after a period of neglect when he took over from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1981. At <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid tribute to the service of all veterans and war dead on behalf of `` a nation that today and always pledges itself to their eternal memory.'' At the memorial, he focused on the nation's most recent war, saying that those who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> are now universally recognized as having earned `` a badge of pride.'' `` In our hearts, you will always be young,'' he said of the dead. The president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, both dressed in black and walking hand-in-hand, left a handwritten note addressed to `` our young friends'' at the base of the chevron-shaped black-granite wall on which the 58,000 names of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war dead are inscribed. `` You fought for your country and for its safety and for the freedom of others with strength and courage,'' said the brief note, placed near the flowers, letters, flags, medals and other items left by thousands of visitors to the memorial. A crowd of several thousand people standing on the wet grass and autumn leaves heard <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declare that although the war divided the nation, the flow of thousands of boat people from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, mass murders in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and other events are evidence the cause was just, `` however imperfectly pursued.'' President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a statement issued from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where he is vacationing, noted that it was the first Veterans Day since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed into law the bill creating the Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs. `` This is a distinction that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s veterans have earned and richly deserve,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It guarantees that those who have worn the uniform of our armed forces will always have a strong voice in our government.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his speech, expressed gratitude to the `` gentle heroes'' of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and said the government was doing everything possible to learn whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers are still captive in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He said unless the government of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> gives assurances that there are n't any who are alive, `` we will assume some are and will do everything we can to find them.''

 Only in public schools are children exposed to a diversity of cultures that will help them relate to people around the world, Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told a group of educators. `` I may have neglected my studies but I sure got an education,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, referring to his childhood in the segregated public schools in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` By the time I left elementary school, I was an accomplished negotiator. ... Nobody wants to fight. You're chicken if you run So to survive, you have to negotiate.'' One of the problems underlying the country's international trade deficit, he said, is that many industrial leaders went to private schools and exclusive colleges where all the students are alike. `` We're running a $ 170 billion trade deficit essentially because the captains of American industry do n't know how to deal with people who are different,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a keynote address Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>.

 Penthouse magazine publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> can buy a $ 12 million Boardwalk tract where a hotel casino was once proposed, a state appeals court said.

 Candidates who hoped to recycle their campaign signs for their next election are upset over a radio contest that offered cash for the listener with the biggest collection of campaign placards. `` I want my signs back, and if any of them are damaged, they're going to have to pay for them I'll sue them if I have to,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBenedetto </PERSON>, a losing candidate for <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` I plan on running again, and a lot of my signs can be used the next time,'' <PERSON> DiBenedetto </PERSON> said.

But politicians began complaining Thursday, and station employees worked to sort out the pile and make peace. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Clerk <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotche </PERSON> said several candidates were unhappy. `` Communication is the word.

 As President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team moved into its new headquarters and aides devised procedures for picking leaders of the next administration, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has gotten his mandate from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' `` We the people can take pride in just how strong our political system is,'' the president said in his weekly radio address, delivered from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md. `` We have made our choice and life goes on.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gotten his mandate from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, a mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and prosperity to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, to bring hope and opportunity to all Americans and to expand the frontiers of freedom around the world,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, vacationed in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Friday where he said little about his plans for the transition. He reiterated that there would be no personnel announcements until after he returns to the nation's capital Monday or Tuesday. Asked if he was compiling lists of potential appointees, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No. No.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, co-director of the transition with <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, chief of staff in the vice president's office, said the two men planned to spend the weekend mulling over procedures for the personnel selection process. They will confer early next week after the transition office officially opens on Monday. `` We'll go to him -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- on Tuesday or Wednesday when he gets back and give him some recommendations,'' <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. A key player in deciding who serves under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, the personnel director. <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, who met Friday with Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, would be in his new office Monday, an aide said. Speculation was rampant, meanwhile, about whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would name to the top jobs. So far, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has picked only one Cabinet member: former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary and campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as secretary of state. Asked about speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confidant, would remain in the job, the vice president responded: `` They've been saying that for weeks.'' He refused to comment further. A source on the transition team, refusing to be quoted by name, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was looking for a new face to replace <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director in 1976, is expected to take a keen interest in filling that job. His desire to look at other people does not necessarily mean he is dissatisfied with <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s performance, the transition source said But `` the vice president want to put his own stamp on things,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as much at a news conference on Wednesday. `` I will for the most part bring in a brand new team of people from across the country,'' he said. Associates of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> have said privately that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director is eager to stay on in the post he took over in May 1987. Earlier in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was told he could keep his job, but since then all he has read in published reports are the names of possible successors, the sources said. One possible candidate for <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, the ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has known since <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> was the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 1970s. The source said former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> was still the front-runner for secretary of defense although the mention of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>, is `` no accident.'' <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the national security adviser under former President Ford, could get the same post in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the source said. But congressional sources indicated there was talk Scowcroft might take over the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Another source, meantime, said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and retiring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> were candidates for White House chief of staff. `` It could go either way,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, the transition's spokeswoman, refused to comment any job speculation.

 The murder case against a disbarred lawyer accused of beating his adopted daughter to death rests on circumstantial evidence, which can be a stumbling block with jurors, according to a legal expert. Prosecutors in the <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> trial admit they have no eyewitnesses or physical evidence linking him directly to 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, so they must try to disprove every reasonable possibility except the defendant's guilt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Uviller </PERSON>, professor of criminal law at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said the word `` circumstantial'' is perceived as `` dirty'' in the minds of many jurors. The prosecutor's first task is to overcome this prejudice, he said. `` Circumstantial evidence should not necessarily be thought of as inferior,'' <PERSON> Uviller </PERSON> said last week. `` It is no different than other kinds of evidence.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, is on trial in the death of the illegally adopted child. The chubby-cheeked first-grader was removed unconscious from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment Nov. 2, 1987. She died three days later. The death of the little girl in an affluent, well-educated household shocked many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse. Prosecutors have introduced photographs showing wounds and bruises on both his live-in companion and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> that were so grim they visibly disturbed many jurors. Prosecutors also have called or will call witnesses to testify that: _ Only <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, his live-in companion, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, and a 16-month-old boy were with <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> when she received her fatal injury _ <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s fatal head injury was consistent with a blow from a man <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s size and that she could not have gotten it from falling down _ <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s knuckles were red, swollen and scratched the day <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was hospitalized and he was arrested _ Ms <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was too physically and emotionally injured to have done anything to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> or to protect the child from the only father she ever knew. _ <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> lied when he told police that the child fell unconscious after choking on vegetables _ <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told reporters there were no bruises on <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> even though they were on every part of her body as she lay comatose in a hospital <PERSON> Uviller </PERSON> said a number of strong indicators of guilt, though `` circumstantial,'' may be more convincing than eyewitnesses. He pointed out that in a circumstantial case the judge must tell the jury they need a `` moral certainity'' to find guilt. The prosecutor should show `` exclusive opportunity'' to commit the crime, and `` motivation and disposition'' based on past behavior, <PERSON> Uviller </PERSON> said. The task of the defense is the opposite of the prosecution, <PERSON> Uviller </PERSON> said, to show that possibilities exist other than the defendant's guilt. In his opening statement, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> told jurors that virtually all the evidence was circumstantial, but he promised that the facts and circumstances taken together would prove the defendant's guilt. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, a former children's book editor, is expected to testify for the prosecution after Thanksgiving. She was also charged with <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, but charges were dropped in return for her testimony. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> spent the past year getting medical and psychiatric treatment for injuries her lawyer, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON>, says she received at <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s hands. <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> says that although the law recognized she was unable to help <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and forgave her, `` She will never forgive herself.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> received <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> the day she was born to an unwed teen-ager, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Launders </PERSON> said she paid <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> $ 500 for `` filing fees'' after he promised to place the baby with a middle-class <PERSON> Catholic </PERSON> family. Instead, he kept the child for himself and Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who are Jewish. Ms. Launders, now 27, watches the trial daily from the front row, occasionally crying and frequently glaring at <LOCATION> Steinberg </LOCATION>. The 16-month-old boy police found in the apartment also was obtained illegally from an unwed teen-ager. He has been returned to his natural mother. The physician who arranged the boy's transfer to <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, illegally placing a child for adoption, and is awaiting sentence.

 Nobody knows now if little <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> had a family name when he was born. Workmen's families in old <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> often did without one. When he died at 60 he no longer needed one _ everybody knew him just as <PERSON> Veronese </PERSON>, the painter from <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION>. The National Gallery of Art is commemorating his death 400 years ago with the opening Sunday of the biggest show of his work ever seen in this country. There will be 50 paintings and 55 drawings, brought together with the help of a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Veronese </PERSON>, the son of a stonecutter, did both secular and religious work Feeling for everyday life comes out in many of them, whatever the theme. A favorite subject was the Holy Family resting on their flight into <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. A donkey is featured in at least three depictions of that scene. One of them adds what the catalog calls `` a rather illogical cow.'' In another, an acrobatic angel picks dates from a tree and tosses them into an apron held by a second angel, while a third attends to the donkey and a fourth is hanging laundry on a bush. There is scholarly disagreement about the laundry. The catalog calls it a `` baby dress.'' <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, curator of the show, thinks it is something that belongs to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The painting comes from the <LOCATION> Ringling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Veronese </PERSON>'s exuberance got him into trouble on a painting of the Last Supper Church authorities called him to task for including `` buffoons, drunkards, Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities.'' They did not mention the soldiers, dogs and exotic animals. By changing the name to `` The Feast in the House of <LOCATION> Levi </LOCATION>'' he saved the canvas from being burned. It is now in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. Almost all the paintings in this exhibit have been recently cleaned, which shows up the brilliant color <PERSON> Veronese </PERSON> is known for. Three were so brilliant, Italian authorities had second thoughts about lending them. `` When the Italian authorities had a look at them after the cleaning they did a double-take,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of the gallery. The three works are larger-than-life paintings of saints from <LOCATION> Modena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. One of them, <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Menna </PERSON>, may be a self-portrait of <PERSON> Veronese </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that unlike American museums, Italian museums must submit their proposals for loans to the national government. They are reviewed by the ministry of foreign affairs. She recalled cases when loans agreements were canceled by the government at the last moment. `` It's their artistic patrimony, you know,'' she said. `` They do n't like some things to leave the country, even on loan.'' The paintings did arrive and were hung, but only on Thursday. The exhibit has been in preparation for four years. It will close Feb. 20.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, broadcast Saturday from Camp David, Md.: My fellow Americans, this week we witnessed a glorious event: we the people going to the polls to determine our political destiny. I guess I do n't need to tell you, I think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did itself proud with the selection of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his vice president. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gotten his mandate from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, the mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and prosperity to bring hope and opportunity to all Americans, and to expand the frontiers of freedom around the world. You know all year long people were saying it was time for a change. Well by your choice this week you proved we were right when we said we _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> party _ are the change. It began eight years ago and it's going to continue. But some things do n't change, like the glory of the American political system. We saw it at work on Tuesday after the dust cleared and the people had spoken. That night the nation was fortunate to witness the grace and dignity of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he congratulated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his victory. He ran a tough race, full of energy and purpose and I salute him for his dedication and courage. On Tuesday night and in the days that have followed it, and in the 10 weeks before January 20th 1989, we the people can take pride in just how strong our political system really is. We take it for granted sometimes, but I could n't help thinking on Tuesday night how inspiring it is that we know we Americans can choose our leader without fear of violence. All Americans from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> know that when the voice of the people is heard, even the mightiest among us must bow before it and accept its wisdom. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it well the other day, `` We can now speak the most magestic words that democracy has to offer. The people have spoken.'' Only twice in our history, during the dark days of our Civil War has anyone dared to question the wisdom of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people as they chose their president, dared to deny the validity of the selection. In other nations a disgruntled group of defeated politicians might try to stage a coup d'etat or might even follow our disastrous mistake from the 1960s and go to war, brother against brother, rather than consent to the will of the people. But here we Americans are just four days after one of the most important nights in our history, working or playing or just enjoying our weekend. We've made our choice, and life goes on. We do n't even need to give it a thought. But when we do, I think it's cause for us to wonder at our freedom. We continue to enjoy our freedom because of those brave Americans among us who have legitimately taken up arms in the service of their country, protecting and defending the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. This weekend, we commemorate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s veterans _ those who did their duty so that we could be free and strong, so that tyranny could find no quarter, so that we could live in peace. I think of the example of Staff Sergeant <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Stollard </PERSON>, one of the Gold Star men in World War II. In a 1944 letter to his parents, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> wrote, `` I believe in making that future a place where little children can go swimming and playing around their homes without being mangled for life from bursting bombs and flaming debris that was once their homes, so that they can have a mother's care instead of being left in some dark corner shivering with cold and dying with hunger and wondering if mother, in a concentration camp, is being cruelly beaten or if she is dead. That's what we are fighting for, and I would gladly give ten lives if I had them.'' Well, like all of us, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Stollard </PERSON> had but one life to give for his country. He died in action in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on July 26, 1944. His heroic example reminds us why sometimes we must take up arms so that we can live free and at peace. Every veteran in this country deserves our thanks and gratitude this weekend of all weekends. And my friends, on this, the last Veteran's Day I will commemorate as President, I would like to say that if there is one change <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I made that touches me most profoundly, it would probably be this: once again, our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their country. Flight Lieutenant <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sure was. Until next week, thanks for listening, and may God bless you.

 Bolivian farmers brought three times as much new land under coca cultivation in 1987 as the government of that country eradicated under an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, congressional investigators said. Widespread corruption in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and the violence of the drug lords in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, along with greatly increased cultivation, have rendered <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> anti-drug programs in those countries ineffective, investigators for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> wrote in a report last week. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> did not examine the programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is the world's largest producer of cocaine, which is made from the coca leaf, and the source of 75 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply. Production capacity for 1987 was estimated by the State department at 143 tons. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is the second-ranking producer with capacity of 99 tons. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> anti-drug expenditures in the two countries will have totaled $ 106 million by the end of the current fiscal year, with current annual spending about $ 10 million in each country. Spending by the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and drug-related spending by the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in both countries add $ 15.6 million a year. A voluntary coca eradication program wiped out 2,570 acres in 1987 and early 1988, `` an all-time high for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>,'' but an estimated 8,150 acres were brought under cultivation, making the total about 100,000 acres, the report said. `` Bolivian narcotics interdiction efforts during 1987 were even less impressive since only 2 percent of the coca paste produced in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> was seized, in addition to 148 kilograms -LRB- 326 pounds -RRB- of cocaine,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has made a notable effort to combat coca cultivation and processing and has been the most cooperative of all Andean countries but was unable to prevent farmers from increasing coca area from 38,300 acres in 1985 to 61,800 acres in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> wrote. Colombian eradication fell from 4,940 acres in 1985 to 1,140 acres in 1987, though seizures of laboratories nearly doubled from 725 to 1,360 in the same time. The murders of judges, government ministers, police officers and editors `` has made it extremely difficult for the government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to recruit qualified individuals to serve'' in police and judicial offices, the report said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expectations may `` exceed the realistically achievable goals and the effect that a $ 10 million narcotics control program can have on a well-established, multi-billion dollar industry'' in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the report said. `` Narcotics corruption is viewed as the largest single problem affecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics control efforts in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. According to several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> officials, corruption exists within all levels of the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> government and very few government officials can be trusted,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said coca eradication efforts were bound to remain futile until an effective herbicide is used in aerial spraying programs, as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> does with marijuana.

 The five astronauts scheduled to fly a classified military space shuttle mission late this month arrived here Saturday for training and a countdown test. `` It's going to be a busy couple days,'' commander <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> told reporters after he and his fellow crewmen flew in from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Asked if <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had set a launch date for the secret mission aboard the shuttle Atlantis, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> replied: `` We're still marching toward the 28th, but there's a possibility of a couple days the other side of that.'' Actually, those `` couple days'' already have been added, with the range schedule now listing the launch date as Nov. 30. Shuttle managers will set a firm date Wednesday following a two-day flight readiness review. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said his crew is `` very excited'' about the flight, much of which is cloaked in secrecy because of its military nature. Sources have reported the astronauts will deploy a huge <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> intelligence-gathering satellite that will fly over 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The exact launch time and length of the mission are classified. After Atlantis reaches orbit, there will be a blackout on information until the end of the flight. Following the astronauts' arrival, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> scheduled practice landing approaches on a runway here in a jet plane equipped to handle like a shuttle. The three mission specialists, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, planned to rehearse driving a tank-like vehicle the astronauts would use in case they had to make an emergency escape from a launch pad problem.

<HEAD>Suspended Sentence Sought For Attempted Killing Of Comatose Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DORDRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The trial of a woman who tried to kill her comatose son has drawn widespread interest in this nation, which has a tolerant attitude toward mercy killing. On Thursday, a prosecutor in this western Dutch city recommended a suspended one-year prison term against the woman, who was convicted of trying to cut the carotid artery of her 20-year-old son, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, in February. Her son has been in a coma for 16 years. The defendant was only identified as 44-year-old Philippine G. in line with Dutch judicial practice. Although euthanasia is formally banned by <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> law, an estimated 5,000 cases occur annually, according to figures provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> courts have meted out token sentences to doctors who performed acts of euthanasia on terminally ill patients, as long as the cases met unofficial guidelines. Under those guidelines, euthanasia is allowed at the explicit request of a patient if a terminal illness causes `` unbearable suffering.'' Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' center-right government is preparing legislation that will allow euthanasia by medical professionals under certain circumstances. A parliamentary debate on the issue is expected next year. In the case in <LOCATION> Dordrecht </LOCATION>, the woman acknowledged she attempted to end her son's life, according to court documents. `` His suffering had become intolerable,'' the woman was quoted as saying. She told the court that she did not want to involve a doctor because `` I wanted to bear the responsibility for this act alone.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> has been in a nursing home since he fell through the ice of a pond in 1971 and was pulled from the water unconscious. Three days after the accident, his doctors removed him from a respirator because they detected no brain activity. However, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> continued to breathe. On Feb. 5, Philippine G. went to the nursing home with a razor blade intending to kill her son, she told the court. `` I went to his room, held his hand and told him that I had to hurt him a little bit,'' she was quoted as saying. But she failed to locate her son's carotid artery, and only inflicted minor wounds before a nurse found her, the court documents said. A ruling on the sentence is expected within two weeks.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: The campaign is behind us and the season of Thanksgiving and Christmas lies ahead. In the process which has served us so well for two hundred years, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have chosen a new President and a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. First of all, let me offer my sincere congratulations to President-Elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He will assume enormous responsibilities for us. And he deserves to have the prayers and the help of us all. There is a venerable and generous tradition in American politics that after the clash of the campaign both sides accept the verdict cheerfully and join hands to pursue the goals of peace and prosperity for which all Americans yearn. Let me express my thanks to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for the vote of confidence by which they returned a strong Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with increased majorities in both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. This is the first time in eighty years, since l908, that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have elected a president of one party while enlarging the majority for the other party in both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and in the governors' offices throughout the country. And so, if there is any clear mandate, perhaps the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are telling both parties, both President and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to work together to achieve those things that so desperately need to be done for our whole country. There are areas in which we have substantial agreement. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke during the campaign of a kinder, gentler nation. We would like very much to help him achieve that goal. I hope we can develop a harmonious working relationship. And as Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, I pledge my best efforts toward that end. It was refreshing to hear Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledge to become an education president. And to the extent that he wishes to follow through on that pledge, I assure him that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will enthusiastically help to the end that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may be number one again in education. And higher education may be placed within the financial reach of all of our young people. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has also promised to do more to clean up our living environment. We know that this pledge includes not just <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, but all the other polluted harbors and rivers and lakes that threaten the public health. And, as he pursues that goal, I promise that Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will find strong bipartisan support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The President-elect said several weeks ago that he favors raising the minimum wage. And, that was good news for millions of low-income Americans who earn the bare minimum which has not increased in almost eight years. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will help him do that. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also looks forward to working with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to improve the quality and availability of safe and wholesome day care facilities for working mothers _ to which he has expressed personal commitment. These will make a fine start towards that kinder, gentler nation. And, so for today, let's lay aside those things that have divided us, and think instead upon those bigger things that unite us. In these areas on which we already agree, let's come together quickly, and get the job done. In those areas where we may disagree, let us start the opening the doors of our minds to search for common ground. Centuries ago, an ancient <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Aristophanes </PERSON> walked among the ruins of the Greek temple devastated by the Peloponnesian wars. He ordered this prayer: `` From the murmur and subtlety of suspicion, with which we vex one another _ give us rest, make a new beginning. Mingle again the kindred nations in the alchemy of love, and with some finer essence of forbearance, temper our minds.'' Those are good words for us today. After the close of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and as together working within this constitutional system, we embark upon our third century of American government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday the peaceful transition of power in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is `` cause for us to wonder at our freedom'' and to be grateful to veterans of the nation's wars. `` In the 10 weeks before Jan. 20, 1989, we the people can take pride in just how strong our political system really is,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address, delivered from Camp David. `` We take it for granted sometimes, but I could n't help thinking on Tuesday night how inspiring it is that we Americans can choose our leader without fear of violence,'' the president said. `` We have made our choice, and life goes on. We do n't even need to give it a second thought, but when we do, I think it's cause for us to wonder at our freedom.'' Mixing reflections on the transition with commemoration of his last Veterans' Day weekend as president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We continue to enjoy our freedom because of those brave Americans who have legitimately taken up arms in the service of their country.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also repeated a note he has sounded often as he spoke on behalf of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s successful campaign for the presidency, saying that `` if there is one change <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I made that touches me most profoundly it would probably be this: Once again our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their country.'' The president did not elaborate on the remark, but has often boasted that his administration rebuilt American military might after a period of neglect. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981, succeeding Democrat <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also took issue with some critics who say that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not have a strong mandate because issues were not spelled out clearly enough during the campaign. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gotten his mandate from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, a mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and prosperity to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, to bring hope and opportunity to all Americans and to expand the frontiers of freedom around the world,'' the president said. In the Democrats' weekly broadcast response, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> extended congratulations to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and thanked voters for increasing the Democratic majorities in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He noted it was the first time since 1908 that Americans have elected a president of one party and at the same time increased the majority for the other party in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and governor's offices across the country `` And so, if there is any clear mandate, perhaps the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are telling both parties _ both president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ to work together to achieve those things that so desperately need to be done for our whole country,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Democrats would like to help him achieve his goal of making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a `` kinder, gentler nation.'' The speaker said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will find bipartisan support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on several of his campaign promises. He mentioned specifically <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledges to become an `` education president,'' to clean up the environment, raise the minimum wage and improve the quality and availability of day-care facilities `` These will make a fine start toward that ` kinder, gentler nation,''' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

 The $ 4.4 billion `` super collider'' atom smasher will be the latest, and maybe the last, link in a chain of probes of nature's basic secrets that began with window glass and sealing wax at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> 58 years ago. When asked what good is such a machine, some physicists like to respond with the answer of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Faraday </PERSON>, who discovered the basic laws of electricity, to <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> when she asked for an explanation of his experiments: `` Madam, of what use is a newborn baby?'' The collider will smash beams of protons into each other at a collision energy of 40 trillion electron volts, 20 times what is now possible at the most powerful existing machine, the four-miles-around `` tevatron'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced last week it would like to put the installation at <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The point of the collisions is to see what new particles are produced by this extreme energy in such a small space that it will match the energy density of the postulated `` big bang'' creation of the universe some 20 billion years ago. The appearance of the right particles will tell scientists whether their latest theories on the origin of the universe are on track. There are no other ways to test these theories. Cosmic rays might create the target particles _ but they are so rare that scientists might have to wait years for the right event, and then years for another. The collider's beam current will be 2 amperes at peaks _ not particularly high for a modern accelerator, but so tightly focused that the collisions should provide 100 to 1,000 times more particles to investigate than the best of today's machines. The protons, moving close to the speed of light, are bent in nearly circular paths in vacuum pipes by 10,000 extremely strong magnets, with fields 66,000 times as strong as the earth's magnetic field. With weaker magnets, the collider would have to be far bigger _ 100 miles around. The use of magnets is the innovation of <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> adapted an idea of a Norwegian physicist, <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Wideroe </PERSON>, who used an electric field to accelerate ions through a tube, then reversed the field to accelerate the ions again to their point of origin. Straight-line accelerators are still used _ <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is bringing a new one on line. But <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> wanted to give his ions many accelerations to reach extremely high energies, and realized the way to do it was to use a magnetic field to bend the ion path 180 degrees between applications of an electric field. With each kick from the electric field, the ion moved to a larger semicircular path, up to the limits of the size of the vacuum container used. In his 1986 history of 20th-century particle physics, `` Inward Bound,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> physicist <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Pais </PERSON> described <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s first machine, assembled by a graduate student in the spring of 1930: `` The vacuum chamber, made at first of pieces of window pane, scraps of brass and an overcoat of wax, fitted between the 4-inch-diameter poles of a spectroscopist's magnet.'' From then on, machines continually increased in energy and new techniques were developed to focus the beams. One major change was the introduction of electromagnets and fixed circular paths, with the magnetic field growing as the particle accelerated to confine the particle to the chosen path. The tevatron near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a smaller machine at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> introduced a major advance: the use of superconductors to power the electromagnets. This means the cables have no electrical resistance, and no power is wasted heating the magnets. The tevatron illustrates the long gestation of modern instruments. Construction of a 200 billion electron volt accelerator was recommended by an advisory panel in 1963. In 1966, after much competition, a committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> recommended the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> site. There have been reports that President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> used the accelerator in political trading with Sen. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON>, R-Ill. Competition for the super collider was just as intense _ 25 states proposed 35 sites _ and losing states have charged that the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was motivated by politics _ the desire to please the new president-elect and to enlist powerful Texans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to win the appropriations necessary It took until 1972, nine years after the first recommendation, to win funds from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and build the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> machine, which has been upgraded since. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still has n't appropriated construction funds for the super collider. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> collider was recommended by a committee of physicists in 1983 `` only after an agonizing decision to abandon several other funding requests for particle accelerators,'' wrote three of its designers, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Tigner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojcicki </PERSON>. It was in the same year that the world was shown again what modern accelerators do: The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, machine operated by a consortium of European nations found the W-particle, the `` intermediate vector boson'' predicted by a theory published in 1967. In an illustration of the international complexity of modern science, the discovery was made by a team led by <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubbia </PERSON>, an Italian who is professor of physics at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and now director of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> installation. Keeping ahead of the Europeans is what drives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> physicists, and their government patrons. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, in announcing the choice of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said, `` Most of the leadership in high-energy physics is headed for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We need to keep those people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' After the 1983 recommendation, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> commissioned a collider design completed in 1986. Basically, it scales up the tevatron and involves no new technology. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did n't decide to try to build the super collider until January 1987, setting off the scramble among states to land an economic plum _ 3,500 or more construction jobs, a permanent staff of 3,000 and a $ 270 million annual operating budget.

<HEAD>Soviet Shuttle Takes Maiden Flight Tuesday; Cosmonauts Set
Endurance Record</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Soviet cosmonauts broke a 326-day record for endurance in space Saturday, and the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced that a second try to launch the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space shuttle will take place Tuesday. The first attempt to launch the shuttle Buran, on Oct. 29, ended 51 seconds before scheduled lift-off when a piece of equipment on the launch pad failed to move away from the unmanned craft. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the two cosmonauts on the space station Mir _ flight commander <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, 41, and engineer <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, 37 _ broke last year's record established by colleague <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON>. <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> were reported healthy with only small changes in their weight and muscle measurements. Scientists worry about atrophy when humans spend long periods in zero gravity in space using just a fraction of their strength. The Buran space shuttle is due to lift off at 6 a.m. Tuesday -LRB- 10 p.m. EST Monday -RRB-. If the unmanned double orbit is successful, officials will begin planning routine flights with a crew, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. However, Soviet authorities said the Buran and its sister ships will shoot off into space `` no more than two to four times a year.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not clarify whether that meant each shuttle would fly only four times a year or whether the entire fleet would make just four flights a year. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON>, director of the Soviet commercial space agency Glavkosmos, said several shuttles are under construction. The Soviets have not said how many shuttles they plan to build. But they will continue to use simpler, less expensive rockets to put satellites into orbit, and save the shuttles for repair and hauling cargo to the Mir space station.

<HEAD>Lead Levels at Skagway Ore Terminal Higher Than First Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lead levels in soil at a <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> ore terminal are up to twice as high as originally reported and environmentalists have accused state officials of withholding details about toxic contamination for years. A state environmental official on Friday confirmed that he wrote a memo on Nov. 1 saying concentrations approached 60,000 parts per million, or 1,200 times normal levels, rather than the 28,000 parts per million announced by the terminal operator Nov. 4. Dozens of residents, including most of the children and pregnant women in the southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town, gave blood and urine samples last week at the state's request. Officials say the tests will confirm whether the high lead levels pose a health threat to the town's 790 residents. `` The situation is certainly serious as the numbers are very high,'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, southeast regional supervisor for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in the Nov. 1 memo to department Commissioner <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>. `` The anxiety level in <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> will also be high.'' `` Concentrations of lead in soil samples far exceed levels at which the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has recommended or taken action in the past,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> wrote. `` For areas where children are exposed such a level for lead is 500-1 ,000 parts per million. Levels of other metals at the terminal, including arsenic, cadmium and mercury, also `` exceed <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> action levels,'' the memo says. At a news conference Nov. 4, an environmental consultant hired by terminal operator <ORGANIZATION> Bowhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said preliminary tests showed soil levels up to 28,000 parts per million _ more than 560 times the level naturally found in <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>'s soil. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was at the conference did not dispute the company's numbers. `` I do remember at one time in the press conference being nervous that you -LRB- reporters -RRB- were not getting the high figure for lead from the company,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said, although he denied any attempt to supress the information and noted that his memo was part of the public record. A representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> charged Friday that state officials had withheld information on the extent of pollution in <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> for years. `` The air, waters, streets, even kids' sandboxes are contaminated with hazardous waste ... at levels hundreds of times above that known to place people at risk,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reller </PERSON> of the environmental group's <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> chapter. `` Essential information is being withheld even today by both state officials and private companies.'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> called that conclusion `` scientifically irresponsible.'' `` I certainly do n't think we've downplayed it,'' he said. `` The intent has been to give out responsible numbers. `` We certainly did n't want to blast out the worst possible picture,'' he said. `` We did n't want any panic in <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>, that was for sure.'' Officials also are uncertain how easily lead sulfide in soil is absorbed by humans, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. Most cleanups have involved sites, such as smelters, contaminated by processed lead. The soil tests were conducted by Bowhead after the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> ordered the operator last summer to stop the spread of lead and zinc ore concentrate at the site. For 20 years, the powdery concentrate has been transported through town to the shipping terminal at <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Since the early 1980s, officials have known that lead sulfide polluted the harbor. <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> is about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. Terminal workers swept the ore off the dock for years. The gusty winds of the <LOCATION> Taiya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> valley also spread the ore, but officials did not consider the threat of lead in the soil until recently. A November 1985 state memo noted that `` the bottom sediments in the <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> have been found to be among the most toxic in the world.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closed the occupied territories, confined 680,000 residents to their homes, cut telephone lines and made arrests Saturday in an attempt to prevent protests during a major meeting of Palestinian leaders. At least two Arabs were shot and wounded in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament in exile, was expected to declare an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> during a four-day meeting that convened Saturday in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Underground Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories called for increased protests during the meeting. Troops entered dozens of villages and towns during the night and arrested a number of suspected activists, said an army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. He did not say how many arrests were made. Nine Israeli-Arab citizens suspected of belonging to a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla cell that threatened <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were arrested, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. Soldiers armed with tear gas, grenade launchers and rifles kept a tight check on the movements of Arabs in the alleys of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. The army turned back Palestinian cars bound for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and police used tear gas to break up a protest outside the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> walls, said police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. At least one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was detained. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> closed all privately-run Arab schools for four days so they would not turn into focal points of unrest, said a city official who demanded anonymity. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools have been closed for almost a year. Information from the occupied areas was limited because the army barred reporters from entering and disconnected many telephone lines. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, troops checked residents' Israeli-issued identity papers and ordered some Palestinians to return to their homes, according to an Arab reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity. A military helicopter and a small airplane circled above the biblical city while soldiers on the ground seized cans of spray paint from stores and covered pro-Palestinian slogans scrawled on walls, the reporter said. Several stone-throwing clashes with youths were reported in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are keeping foot and mobile patrols continuously moving to prevent any form of gathering whatsoever,'' said a police officer in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> who requested anonymity. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers distributed leaflets written in Arabic in which the army appealed to residents to maintain order, said another Arab reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Do n't deceive yourselves that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> have any weight in solving the regional conflict,'' the leaflets said. `` They are only ink on paper ... We ask you not to incite emotions.'' The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s 650,000 residents were confined to their homes all day Saturday and another 30,000 residents of four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns and a refugee camp were under curfew. Despite the restrictions, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> youths took to the streets to set tires aflame and block roads, said an Arab reporter there. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, a 20-year-old man from the <LOCATION> Jabalia </LOCATION> refugee camp was shot in the hand and a 30-year-old man from the <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> camp was shot in the shoulder, hospital officials said. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city with 100,000 residents, was declared a closed military area, meaning no one could leave or enter the city limits, said the army spokesman. `` Today was quiet, that's a fact,'' the army spokesman said. `` But the test is not one day. We are still waiting.'' He said he did not know when the restrictions would be lifted. On Dec. 8, 1987, the 1.5 million Palestinians living in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began an uprising against Israeli control of the lands captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. Thousands of Palestinians have been shot and wounded in the 11-month-old uprising, which has claimed the lives of 310 Arabs and 11 Israelis.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was eulogized Saturday as `` not one who attracted fair-weather friends'' in a gathering of friends that included former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, his former law partner and boss, and others from the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. The former attorney general, who had won the Silver Star for gallantry for his World War II <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> service, was buried with full military honors at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> died Wednesday at 75 after a heart attack. His bronze coffin, covered by the American flag, was borne on a caisson pulled by six white horses as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> band played the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hymn. Seven sailors fired three volleys that echoed through the huge cemetery on a crisp, fall day; a bugler sounded taps. A neighboring grave holds the remains of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` Pappy'' <PERSON> Boyington </PERSON>, a Medal of Honor winner whose life <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is credited with saving, and nearby are the graves of heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a four-star general.

He did not take any part in the service and did not attend the burial. Mrs. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did not accompany the former president. The pallbearers included <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s five grandsons by two children from his first marriage. The list of mourners read like a Who's Who of the <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> years, including <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardian </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s co-defendants in the Watergate cover-up trial <PERSON> Mardian </PERSON>'s conviction in that case was reversed by a higher court. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice and served 19 months of a 2 -LCB- - to-8 year prison sentence H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, his other co-defendants in that trial, did not attend the funeral. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was one of 18 unindicted co-conspirators in the Watergate scandal. There was only one reference to the scandal that brought the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration down. `` What he went through was the most unfair, cruel treatment of a public figure in the history of this cynical city,'' said former <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in the eulogy. `` It is said that you judge a man by the friends he makes and the friends he keeps,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` He made friends in every phase of his life, in law, in government, in politics, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> was not one who attracted fair weather friends.''

<HEAD>Army Rejects Guerrilla Truce, Calls It Propaganda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The armed forces chief on Saturday rejected a cease-fire announced by leftist guerrillas, calling it a propaganda ploy aimed at Western Hemisphere diplomats gathered here. `` The armed forces have a constitutional mission to carry out, which is to combat subversion. I have not recieved any such orders to suspend operations,'' Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> told reporters during a breakfast meeting. Marxist-led guerrillas who have been at war with the U.S.-backed government for nine years said Friday they would halt all but defense operations during the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> general assembly. They said their truce would run from Sunday night through Friday, the final day of the assembly. Foreign ministers and top diplomats from 31 nations are in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for the meeting. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said he did n't expect a major guerrilla offensive during the assembly, which opens Monday. `` But since we never believe what communists say, we will keep our guard up,'' he added. `` The subversives have temporarily changed their tactics, from military-terrorist action to organization of mass protests in the streets,'' said <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, who became head of the joint chiefs Nov. 1. Leftist labor, student and peasant organizations have announced a series of protests, marches and rallies for the coming week. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said government troops captured rebel plans for anti-government activity that includes marches, sit-ins, church takeovers and rallies. He said the plans for `` Operation Worm'' were taken in combat about 10 miles northwest of the capital. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said he had the rebel documents with him, but he refused to show them to journalists. `` This mobilization is not distinct from the overall guerrilla strategy, but one of its avenues,'' he said. `` It is intended to demonstrate to the ministers that they -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- enjoy a popular support that in reality they do not have.'' The rebels say the centrist, democratically elected administration of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is a facade for a repressive, military-dominated government. They demand formation of what they call a government of broad popular participation, which would include revolutionaries. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> insists the guerrillas first lay down their arms. The armed forces and police _ more in evidence than usual on city streets _ are carrying out `` <LOCATION> Operation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' to provide security for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The number of men involved is classified, but sources said the operation comprised several thousand. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is scheduled to attend the inaugural session of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> general assembly. He will return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday evening. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> agenda includes discussion of hemispheric issues including <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s staggering foreign debt, drug smuggling and human rights. The organization will also try to deal with its fiscal crisis. A commission has recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> budget be reduced by 30 percent and that its staff of 1,004 be reduced 25 percent. Most members of the group, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are far behind in their dues.

<DATELINE>KFAR HABAD, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jewish fundamentalists have broken out of their tight-knit neighborhoods and self-imposed isolation in a quest for political power that has alarmed a largely secular <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the early years of the Jewish state, members of the ultra-Orthodox movements of Judaism concentrated on rebuilding communities nearly wiped out by the Holocaust. The task has been largely accomplished, and many fundamentalists have now become involved in politics. `` By participating in the political process, these parties are modernizing. They are breaking out of the ghetto,'' said <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, professor at the religious <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` They want a piece of the national pie.'' The Orthodox hope that gaining seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, and the Cabinet will help them put religion back into the daily life of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where about 75 percent of the 3.5 million Jews are non-religious. In the Nov. 1 elections, four religious parties _ the <ORGANIZATION> Torah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION>, the Shas, the Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ captured 15 percent of the 2.2 million votes and 18 pivotal seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. The four parties hold the balance of power between the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won 39 seats, and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which won 40 seats. Their new political spirit is illustrated by the Habad Hasidim _ the power behind the Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> party _ which has built a strong missionary army to recruit non-religious Jews. `` We share our Judaism with all Jews,'' said Habad spokesman <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Birke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Birke </PERSON> underlines Habad's acceptance of the outside world by offering his guests cans of kosher Budweiser beer made in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> under rabbinical supervision. Habad followers hand out candles to soldiers in the field on the Sabbath, visit families at home and urge Jewish students in bus stations to wrap their arms in phylacteries, traditional prayer straps, and worship. Kfar Habad, 12 miles inland from the pubs and non-kosher restaurants of secular <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, is a strict Orthodox village with 450 families, or about 2,700 people _ one of five such communities in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Habad, which claims a half-million supporters throughout the world, has built a reputation for charitable acts. It takes in and gives vocational training to children from broken homes, sponsors community centers in poor neighborhoods and has built 25 synagogues in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> alone. Hundreds of Habad followers were flown in from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help with the election campaign. The focus of the Habad movement is the Lubavitcher Rabbi <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneerson </PERSON>, 86, who was born in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and lives in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. He is revered as a visionary with near-miraculous powers. <PERSON> Schneerson </PERSON>'s followers in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Habad </LOCATION> have built a replica of the rabbi's three-story <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters that is so exact the red bricks have been artificially weathered to match those on the original building. Rabbi <PERSON> Schneerson </PERSON>'s orders propelled Habad into politics for the first time. Squadrons of volunteers canvassed neighborhoods, promising the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rabbi's personal blessings in exchange for votes. `` We got 102,000 votes,'' <PERSON> Birke </PERSON> noted. That translated into five <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> seats for the ultra-Orthodox Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which got only two seats in the last election in 1984. All the religious parties believe God gave the Jewish people the Land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied in 1967. The most dovish is Torah Flag, which supports giving up land if it means saving lives. `` To give back land or not give back land is not relevant. We need to strengthen the moral fiber of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON>, spokesman for the six-seat <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or Torah Guardians. He said the government should focus on problems such as drug abuse and housing. The chief demand of Orthodox parties is to amend the Law of Return, which provides automatic citizenship to any Jew. Current law defines a Jew as someone born of a Jewish mother or converted to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. The Orthodox demand that conversions be approved by their branch of Judaism, rather than the less traditional Conservative or Reform movements. The religious parties have presented a long list of other demands that also would affect life in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for non-religious Jews: _ The Jewish Sabbath should be officially recognized as the nation's day of rest City councils should have the power to close public places such as pubs, restaurants and soccer stadiums. _ Kosher food should be served in all public restaurants, eliminating pork, which is banned under Orthodox religious laws _ All schools should be assigned a rabbi _ Laws should be tightened on autopsies, archaeological digs and Christian missionary activity Orthodox laws ban autopsies. _ Judges in rabbical courts, which oversee marriage and divorce, should get the same salaries as civil court counterparts and their rulings should be exempt from <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review

 Grenade-throwing gunmen attacked a gold mining town and surrounding ranches in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, killing at least 34 civilians and leaving 31 people injured, authorities said Saturday. The state governor and an army general said 200 leftist guerrillas carried out the attack, but a local mayor claimed it was done by dozens of members of a right-wing death squad. The gunmen rode into <PERSON> Segovia </PERSON> during a thunderstorm Friday night and blasted the telephone exchange, city hall, the main park, two bars and a commercial establishment, authorities said. `` It was an ordinary weekend, with people talking in the park, drinking in the bars, listening to music and enjoying themselves when this criminal act was perpetrated, bringing pain and sadness to many homes,'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state, told radio networks <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. Authorities first reported that an army post also was attacked, but <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>, without citing sources, later said it learned the army post was not attacked. Segovia Mayor <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobon </PERSON> <PERSON> Areiza </PERSON>, of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said gunmen first attacked ranches near the town and that casualties outside of town could raise the death toll to 50. The mayor, interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>, did not say if the gunmen were guerrillas or a death squad. <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> said the gunmen belonged to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION>. Leftist guerrillas have been fighting to overthrow the government for 25 years and establish a Marxist state. Mayor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojo </PERSON> of the nearby town of <PERSON> Remedios </PERSON> said the attack on <PERSON> Segovia </PERSON> was by a right-wing death squad that has been active in the area. <PERSON> Rojo </PERSON> is also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has seen more than 600 of its members killed by right-wing death squads in the last three years. <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>'s station in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, in northwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, reported it received a telephone call from a man identifying himself as the commander of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces in the area of <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION>, a town of 15,000 about 180 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The man, identifying himself as Commander <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>, claimed the attack was by a death squad, <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said. In 1983, the bodies of 33 miners who had been shot were found in a mine shaft near <LOCATION> Remedios </LOCATION>, 15 miles from <PERSON> Segovia </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said the miners were leftist sympathizers killed by a right-wing death squad. The government is still investigating that massacre. Gov. <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> said helicopters were sent from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berrio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the state capital, with reinforcements and medical help. Gen. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cubillos </PERSON>, commander of the 14th Brigade, which is based in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berrio </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> that `` subversives killed women and even beggars.'' The military chief said the attack took place during an electrical storm that made it hard to move troops into <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION>, located in the main gold-mining area of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The attack was the second-worst in recent years in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. On Aug. 23, 12 civilians, 12 police and 18 guerrillas died during an attack on <LOCATION> Saiza </LOCATION>, 280 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. In another guerrilla attack Friday, four Colombian marines were injured by a mine near the town of <LOCATION> Ovejas </LOCATION>, 380 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>.

 The water along seven miles of ocean beaches closed by a sewage spill was declared safe for swimming Saturday, but health officials kept it off-limits at least through the weekend as a precaution. The county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> still wanted to test bacteria levels in a creek that feeds the ocean and check a metal cap placed over the outlet that spewed sewage for at least three days, said health spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Petralia </PERSON>. `` We want to play it safe for at least another day,'' he said. Authorities have been unable to say exactly how much sewage spilled, but described it as a major flow. It caused bacteria levels in the surf near the city's biggest recreational habor, <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON>, to rise to more than double the levels considered safe for swimming, city biologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said. The discharge apparently was caused by the failure of a 30-inch cap welded on an overflow sewer line about 15 miles inland, according to <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Biagi </PERSON>, director of the city <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Biagi </PERSON> said he had ordered an inspection of 30 similar caps throughout the city.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Defendant Guilty In Center City Stalker Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man accused of being the `` Center City Stalker'' has been convicted of robbery, assault and attempted rape in 10 attacks on women in downtown office buildings. <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, 36, was found guilty Friday by jurors who deliberated 10 to 12 hours after hearing 70 witnesses and being shown more than 100 pieces of evidence. One of the stalker's victims wept when the verdict was read. `` I do n't think I'll ever forget this,'' the woman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>, which did not use her name. `` I thought that I'd be a lot happier. I really do n't feel that good _ I feel sad.'' For three months, the so-called stalker terrorized women who lived or worked downtown. He hid in stairwells and hallways in office buildings within six blocks of City Hall. He used tricks or force to get young victims into out-of-the-way locations, where he would rob or sexually assault them. The defense contended that police arrested the wrong man because officers were pressured to wrap up the case. Attorneys leaned heavily on conflicting descriptions of the attacker from the 10 victims. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristal </PERSON> told the jury that <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was the victim of a police conspiracy carried out by `` three bad cops who were given a mission to plant a seed that bore poisoned fruit.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> characterized <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> as a compulsive sexual deviate. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was charged in May with 45 counts of robbery, assault and sexual violence in the 10 attacks between January and March. He faces a prison sentence of between 100 and 200 years, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said. In addition, he could be forced to serve the 12 years remaining on an earlier conviction for stabbing a man to death on a bus. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was paroled on that conviction after serving 7 -LCB- years. `` Everybody can be assured that this guy will never get out of jail to bother anybody again,'' the prosecutor said.

<HEAD>Pope Says Conscience Not Enough In Birth Control Decisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday rebuked Catholics who say they are following their own conscience in using artificial birth control. The pontiff also criticized theologians who have dissented from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s teaching on contraceptives, saying they `` make void the cross of Christ.'' `` When <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> defined the contraceptive act as intrinsically illicit, he meant that the moral norm does not admit exceptions: no personal or social circumstance has ever been able, is able, or will ever be able in itself to ordain such an act,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told 300 theologians from 34 nations at a conference on birth control. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said that in the two decades since Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> issued `` Humanae Vitae,'' the encyclical condemning artificial birth control, many people have accepted the idea that their conscience established moral principles. `` In this way, there has been a radical breakdown in the bond of obedience to the holy will of the creator, which was the basis of human dignity,'' the pope told the conference, which was called to discuss moral theology on the 20th anniversary of `` Humanae Vitae.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said that whoever differed with church teaching because of his or her own conscience rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> concepts of moral conscience and magisterium, or the church's authority. `` You ca n't say that a member of the faithful has carried out a diligent investigation of the truth if he does n't take into account what the magisterium teaches; if, availing himself of any other source of knowledge, he makes himself the judge; if, in doubt, he follows his own opinion or that of theologians instead of the teaching of the church,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. Many Catholics, especially in developed countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have ignored church teaching on contraception. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops suggested in a draft letter released this year that the church be more receptive toward women who used artificial birth control.

<TEXT>
 Two Americans who illegally entered <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in search of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prisoners of war were freed Saturday after their supporters paid $ 1,500 and canceled a protest at the Laotian Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, the Laotian capital. They appeared exhausted after 41 days of detention, 32 of them in solitary confinement. The two entered communist <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to advertise a reward offer for the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> POWS from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war. `` It was a horrible 41 days, but I do n't regret it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION>, who lost 15 pounds. `` The only hope that our men in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> have is that someone brings them out.'' She said a stern-looking police colonel told them that while they were being freed, any others who entered <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> illegally would not be. `` They would stay forever, forever,'' she quoted the colonel as saying. Miss Long, a 45-year-old writer from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, a 44-year-old schoolteacher from <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, were taken into custody Oct. 3. They had sailed across the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> boundary between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, entered a Laotian village, and distributed leaflets advertising a $ 2.4 million reward for the return of any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> war prisoner. The reward has been pledged by 21 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressmen and some private citizens. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has denied holding prisoners from the war, from which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew in 1973. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has criticized Miss Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, saying what they did jeopardized official efforts to account for 547 Americans listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. When an angry policeman saw Miss Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> in the village, the two rushed down a hill and a Thai who was hired to navigate the boat started the engine. But the policeman ordered him to cut the engine. The Thai was released quickly. The Americans said they were kept in the village for a day, then moved to <LOCATION> Pakse </LOCATION> city for a few days stay before being flown to <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. Upon landing, the two were put in a jeep manned by two men with machine guns, who blindfolded them. They were driven into the garage of what they later found out was the immigration building, a five-minute walk from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. In the garage, they feared the worst. `` It got really dark,'' said Miss Long. `` Then everybody got out of the jeep and the only people still in the jeep were us and the two people with the guns behind us. I thought this was it, the big one.'' `` I thought we would be shot in the back of the head,'' <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> said. Instead they were taken up to their separate rooms to begin their solitary confinement. In <LOCATION> Pakse </LOCATION>, the two had to sign statements that they had intruded into <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and caused problems. Miss <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, `` I was interrogated on numerous occasions and they would take that statement and over and over again ask the same questions. They wanted to know just about everything. They kept asking me who is your boss and who sent you here.'' In her last session, on Oct. 29, they asked: `` Why do you help to try to find criminals? American servicemen ... bombed our houses, killed our people, people who did nothing to them. They are criminals.'' Miss <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said the police colonel complained people were abandoning their work and searching for the American servicemen in order to collect the reward. He said people were crossing the river into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to find out more about the reward. Miss <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said she spent her time exercising, singing, and making things, including a deck of cards from cigarette packs to play solitaire. <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> said a plant grew in the corner of his rat-infested room, and at one point, he did not speak to anyone for two weeks. He said his trip into <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> `` was n't a mistake. I'm more convinced than ever that there are prisoners of war there.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stader </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday that <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> authorities agreed to release the pair in return for $ 1,500 in administrative costs. Another condition imposed by <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, he said, was that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans group cancel a demonstration it had planned for the <ORGANIZATION> Laotian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday to protest the detention. The National Steering Committee for American Vietnam War Veterans canceled the protest and gave the $ 1,500 fee to <PERSON> Stader </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of ancient artifacts collected in 20 years from all over the world went on the auction block Saturday, to help pay the legal expenses of a man accused of sexual torture and murder. The first item to go, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> ancestral figure, brought $ 200. A Sepik River ceremonial bone knife from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> was sold for $ 300. They and the other items _ believed to be worth several hundred thousand dollars _ were collected by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, who ran a tiny shop called the Bizarre Bazaar. Police found the artifacts _ from 2,000-year-old Roman vials filled with tears to Peruvian cloth fragments to Tibetan exorcism knives _ jumbled into boxes that were piled to the ceilings of <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s midtown home. `` The police took out 1,000 boxes from house. They said the whole house was just passageways between the boxes,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> of the public relations firm that coordinated the auction. Police were called to <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s house in June when a man ran screaming from it wearing only a dog collar, saying he had been sexually tortured for four days. Two skulls were found _ one buried in the back yard and another in a second-floor closet _ and <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to one murder and is charged in another. Police also found a packet of bones believed to be human vertebrae and 200 pictures of nine bound men being tortured. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, being held in the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, has kept close watch on the auction. `` He called last night and again this morning,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` He's watched a videotape and made suggestions that this should be displayed a little more prominently or this should be pushed back a little bit because it's not so valuable.'' Browsers before the start of the four-day auction sifted among fern fossils and large reptile bones. There were Phillippine and Arabic brass bowls, and ancient coins from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Costume masks from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and puppets from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> lined one wall. There were Oriental necklaces, Tibetan necklaces, Kurdish beaded necklaces and Roman beaded necklaces. A Sepik River statue from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> stood among several Buddhas. `` There are things from 16 million years ago to the present,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON>, who spent four weeks appraising the 2,000 items. `` It is intercontinental, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Ancient beads, Iron Age cookware, things from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the Holy Land and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.'' No rhyme or reason was apparent to the collection. A necklace later determined to be 22-carat gold and valued at about $ 8,000 was found mixed in a box of beads. `` He was eclectic,'' <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> said. `` His own specific -LRB- interest -RRB- was in beads. He liked to find and design jewelry. He would duplicate jewelry from old pictures that he saw.'' It was the jewelery that mostly drew people to <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s shop in a flea market. About 200 people were in place Saturday when the auction got off to a slow start. Auctioneer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryther </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> prodded the buyers by telling them it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Dr. <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirshberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, waited for a `` Soul Catcher'' from the northwest coast of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to come up for sale. `` It was used in healing ceremonies to keep the patient alive and keep the soul from leaving,'' said <PERSON> Hirshberg </PERSON>, a collector. `` It also was used to keep other souls who, shall I say, do not have a body, from entering.''

 About 250 supporters of former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution Editor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> staged a mock jazz funeral procession Saturday, then cheered a speaker as he blasted the newspapers for accepting <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s resignation. `` <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, you should be ashamed,'' the crowd chanted outside the newspapers' offices. Mrs. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, is the chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and co-owner of its parent chain, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Novelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, whose novels include `` The Great Santini'' and `` Prince of Tides,'' offered to donate the profits of his next book to Mrs. Chambers if she would rehire <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>. `` If money is the sole reason she and the <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> chain exist on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, then I'll be glad to give her more of it,'' <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said at a rally behind the newspaper offices. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, who watched from a short distance, said there is no `` realistic'' chance he would return to the newspapers and declined to elaborate on his Nov. 4 resignation.

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Claim They Take Key Highway, Kill 20 Soviet Troops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Afghan guerrillas claimed Saturday they cut the strategic Salang Highway between the capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in an offensive that killed 20 Soviet soldiers. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported that the Soviet-backed Afghan army had retaken another highway, a 72-mile route from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> eastward toward the Pakistani border. The `` government army has regained control of the <LOCATION> Kabul-Jalalabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>,'' the radio said, adding that 1,358 rebels were killed in fighting in the provinces of <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Helmand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Badghis </LOCATION>. The claims could not be confirmed independently. The <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group claimed the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> was closed. In the Pakistani frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweib </PERSON> said five guerrillas were killed in the fighting. The highway is the main route by which Soviet soldiers were leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under an accord calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops. <PERSON> Schweib </PERSON> said Moslem guerrillas staged repeated attacks along the 240-mile highway, which runs from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Soviet border town of <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schweib </PERSON> said 20 Soviets were killed and 22 tanks destroyed in one attack Nov. 6 on a convoy near the town of <LOCATION> Rabatak </LOCATION> in the northern province of <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of the Soviet border. <PERSON> Schweib </PERSON> said the attacks on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Samangan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Parwan </LOCATION> provinces have destroyed about 140 Soviet-Afghan military vehicles, including tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks. He did not elaborate on casualty figures. Last week, <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> discussed the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> offensive with reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Until the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> offensive, rebels in the area had been letting withdrawing Soviet troops leave unimpeded. But guerrilla leaders said the introduction early this month of Soviet surface-to-surface missiles and MiG-27 jets is tantamount to a renewed Soviet invasion. An accord signed in April provided for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and half the force left by Aug. 15. The timetable calls for completion of the withdrawal by Feb. 15. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said Nov. 4 it had suspended the withdrawal, charging that the accord was being broken by the continued arming of the insurgency by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Soviets said the temporary suspension did not consititute a breach of the accord. In other developments, government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that 10 people were killed in attacks on two cities. The broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said one person was killed and another injured when a bomb exploded Saturday in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The radio said the device was planted by `` criminals,'' presumably Moslem insurgents who have been fighting the communist government for 10 years. The broadcast said eight people were killed and 20 injured during the past two days when surface-to-surface rockets hit residential areas in <LOCATION> Charikar </LOCATION>, 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, determined not to make any news while he is on vacation, spent Saturday in the surf and sun and used his private time to make phone calls and write thank-you notes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conferred briefly by telephone with his chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who is leading the transition team that will put together the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> are working on potential Cabinet nominations and other possible administration appointments. The only information being disseminated officially by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff on Saturday dealt with the president-elect's recreation schedule and his letters and calls of thanks to people who had helped in the campaign or congratulated him on winning the election. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was asked during a briefing Saturday what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had to say about the dramatic drop in the stock market since the election and the dollar's plunge to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen. Analysts said the decline reflected worries about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ability to deal with the federal budget deficit. `` We wo n't have anything to say about that,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> replied. Pressed further, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said: `` He's on vacation right now and I'm sure he's aware of it and has his own thoughts on it, but it's not something we'll be sharing with you. Instead, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told about how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had surf-fished twice that day for whiting, pompano and barracuda. He did n't catch anything, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> noted, a fact verified at a distance by reporters and photographers who staked out the beach behind the oceanfront home of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s multimillionaire friend <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamps </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Attired in blue shorts, a red, long-sleeved shirt and blue cap, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went into the balmy waters up to his waist in an effort to land a fish while <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents kept an eye on the beach. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, wearing white slacks and a blue striped top, came out to watch, along with <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, and 22-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned an afternoon nap and a game of golf. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the president-elect was settling into a pattern for the four-day vacation of recreation time in the afternoon and telephone calls and writing in the morning. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> telephoned several people Saturday morning to thank them for their help in his campaign or for their congratulatory calls and telegrams. Among them were comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>, former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. Guy Hunt and Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided not to dine out while staying in this exclusive, palm tree-dotted community because of the security measures that would be required. `` The idea is to keep the disruptiveness of this as little as possible,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Harvey Rosenfield: Nader Protege Comes Into Own With Insurance
Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As far as <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> is concerned, <PERSON> David </PERSON> had it easy against Goliath _ at least <PERSON> David </PERSON> had a sling and five stones. <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> started with only a few dollars and a cause in a fight against the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> insurance industry, and ended up a giant slayer with his Proposition 103 ballot initiative to roll back insurance rates more than 20 percent. The <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> protege said the initiative's victory in Tuesday's election amounted to a voter revolt, with the message that consumers will no longer tolerate high insurance rates and ineffective politicians. `` This proves that you can fight city hall and win,'' he said in his apartment Saturday. `` We've proven that word of mouth and a grassroots campaign is far more powerful than all the slick 30-second TV ads that money can buy.'' The insurance industry, which watched its $ 70 million campaign go down the drain, immediately took its battle to the courts amid threats to pull out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and predictions of economic doom. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> temporarily froze the rate rollbacks for motorists, businesses, homeowners and municipalities until it can decide if the measure is constitutional. The prospect of another long and costly battle to implement Proposition 103 left <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> with little time to celebrate, but he said he's confident that the movement he launched in 1986 will be victorious in the end. `` Just like Proposition 13, the taxpayer rebellion that started in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and spread through the nation, Proposition 103, the voter revolt to cut insurance rates, will sweep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> like a prairie wildfire,'' he said. <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON>, 36, announced the drive to put Proposition 103 on the ballot in November 1986 after an unsuccessful attempt to push insurance reform through the Legislature. <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> has been a staff attorney for <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and director of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. If he's lucky, he'll make about $ 20,000 this year, a fraction of what he figures individual classmates at <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>'s law school class of 1979 are making. But, he said, `` At least I'm having fun and doing something good. I wonder if they can say that.'' His Nader connection proved crucial to the campaign for Proposition 103, one of five complicated insurance measures crowding the longest and perhaps most confusing ballot in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> vigorously campaigned for Proposition 103, giving it credibility among many voters and drawing the kind of publicity that the campaign could not buy with its $ 2.3 million budget, <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said. `` People were so interested in the demand for insurance reform that they were looking for the right measure,'' said <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON>. `` People were asking who is behind these things. That's what the whole thing came down to. There's no question that <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>'s integrity and commitment to consumers is so widely known and universally share that voters trusted him. The five measures, together with 24 other propositions, triggered more than $ 130 million in campaign spending, about $ 70 million of it by insurance companies. It was the most expensive campaign in the country outside of a presidential race. Two big insurance companies, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION>, said they would stop selling new liability policies in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Other companies said they might be forced to follow suit. But by Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> and Mercury reversed themselves and took a wait-and-see stand. Two state senators threatened to press for multimillion-dollar penalties if companies flee the state. In the meantime, <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> and his supporters at <ORGANIZATION> Voter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rates </ORGANIZATION> plan their next moves. `` Voter Revolt will stay around and try to raise money to enforce Proposition 103, fight the legal attack in court, and make sure it's enforced fairly by the insurance commissioner,'' he said `` We're still going.

<HEAD>Leahy Charges Foreclosure Warnings Timed to Hit After Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Saturday of timing foreclosure warnings to hit about 90,000 farms just after the election. However, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency involved denied the charge and said the regulations involved were too complex to have been completed earlier. The notices will tell delinquent borrowers from the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that they are seriously behind in their payments, should start considering their options and tell <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> within 45 days what they want to do. The notices will lay out the options farmers may pursue. Those options, under 1987 legislation signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> early in 1988, permit the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> under some circumstances to write down some debts or to grant new terms. The legislation required a major reorganization of FmHA programs, including the notices to delinquent borrowers. `` Giving the administration the benefit of every doubt, the notices could have gone out by Labor Day,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Draft regulations were published for comment Sept. 14, to take effect Nov. 14, which is Monday. <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> officials said in late October they expected to begin mailing the notices soon after Nov. 14, and <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said he tried to bring this out in campaign appearances in farm states on behalf of fellow Democrats. `` There's no question in my mind it was deliberately held off'' so the notices would follow the presidential election but precede the return of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and inauguration of the new president, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, said the timing `` had nothing to do with the election.'' `` We had a tremendous job in training field people to make these regulations work and we had to scrub the list to make sure it was clean,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't realize what it has wrought,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, calling it `` the most complex regulation we've ever had to publish.'' `` We tried, but we just could n't'' publish the regulation sooner, he said. The regulation takes up 160 pages in a special section of the Sept. 14 Federal Register. FmHA estimates it has $ 8.8 billion in past-due loans. The agency lends to the shakiest of the nation's 2.16 million farmers, those who can not get credit through normal commercial channels.

 Marching bands played, champagne corks popped and residents gleefully speculated what they could get for their property when they learned they'd be neighbors of the new `` super collider.'' But real estate agents Saturday warned that any property value increases would be slow in coming. `` The thing that we have tried to do is be realistic with our sellers,'' said <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Boardman </PERSON>, broker associate with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> in DeSoto, between <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` We do n't see any getting rich quick. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> announced the selection Thursday of <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, as the home for the $ 4.4 billion atom smasher, a 53-mile tunnel scientists hope will give an unprecedented view of the basic structure of matter. <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, a town of small buildings and 18,000 residents that is seat of primarily agricultural <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, will be encircled by the super collider. The giant science project is expected to result in 4,000 construction jobs and 3,500 permanent jobs. The project will take eight years to build; the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hopes to complete it in 1996. But deficit reduction pressures will toughen the fight to fund the super collider, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressional leaders warned. Real estate agents in <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said that funding battle has tempered some of the enthusiasm generated by <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s announcement `` Some of the homeowners feel there's going to be an immediate appreciation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Boardman </PERSON> said. `` We feel it's going to be gradual. They've got to get the funding first.'' The city's economy is based largely on the region's cotton and sorghum crops, but <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> has discovered <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, too. `` <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>,'' `` Tender Mercies,'' `` Places In The Heart,'' `` True Stories'' and `` A Trip to Bountiful'' have all been shot in or near the town. <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> is a <LOCATION> Tonkawa </LOCATION> Indian word for `` buffalo creek.'' The county blossomed in the early 1980s but not as much as its northern neighbors, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> counties. Two years ago, the largely rural area felt the blow of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> recession. `` Residential values have gone down significantly in the last two years,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Batte </PERSON>, sales associate with <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> and Associates in <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>. `` Raw land and commercial values have been real flat. ... We've had almost no sales of raw land near <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> for the last 18 months to two years.'' <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamerbeek </PERSON> of the local Coldwell Banker office said many property values in the area dropped between 6 percent to 8 percent last year, but she hopes the prospect of the atom smasher will turn that around. `` We think <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has already bottomed out and it's only a matter of how long it will stay at the bottom,'' she said. `` We've even had a lot of calls from people out of state.'' <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Nooner </PERSON>, 73, who has a real estate business in <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, said there probably will be a lot of land sold soon. `` I just kind of think there will be a lot of speculation,'' he said. `` People will want to move down from some other states and be in on the action, and there will be some houses sold.'' <PERSON> Batte </PERSON> said he had an appointment Saturday to show a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investor some land. `` Homeowners do n't need to increase their prices yet,'' <PERSON> Batte </PERSON> said. `` The people interested now are interested in raw land as an investment.'' A typical two - to three-bedroom home costs about $ 90,000, said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> of the Coldwell Banker office A real estate agent in <LOCATION> Midlothian </LOCATION>, a town of 5,200 between the super collider and <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said land values near the super collider campus may jump $ 500 an acre once <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves funding for the project. But the agent, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, said large tracts in the long term may jump from a current level of about $ 4,000 an acre to $ 6,000. <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON> said she would cooperate with the government if it needs her 25 acres on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, but she does n't want to sell to a developer `` It would have to be a lot more than most people could rig up before I would sell,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON>, who raises cutting horses with her husband. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, an employee at <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION>, said not everyone is excited about the super collider. `` Most of the old timers are not,'' Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. `` It'll just be a big mess. `` You always have some who do n't want them to mess with a little gingerbread town,'' Nooner said.

 Police have confiscated a home garbage disposal unit they say may have been used to dispose of parts of a woman they suspect was murdered. `` We took out the whole thing -LRB- disposal -RRB- and sealed it up,'' said homicide Detective <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> `` Rusty'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` We're going to run some tests on it and see what we can find. The appliance was one of several items police took as evidence Wednesday in their investigation of the possible death of 32-year-old <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Baughman </PERSON>. Police say they have received a tip that Ms. <PERSON> Baughman </PERSON> was smothered or drowned in a bathtub last weekend and then dismembered. Police arrested her husband, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 41, and charged him with murder. He remained in jail Saturday under $ 1 million bond. During the search of the house, police said, they discovered evidence that blood had been leaned up, leading them to believe Ms. <PERSON> Baughman </PERSON> had been killed there. `` We're kind of letting the people with the chemistry sets work on it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` There are a number of chemical tests being done on this one. Hopefully, some of those tests will lead us to some type of conclusion.'' Earlier in the week, police found what they believed were scorched fragments of fingers in an alley. Investigators with the <ORGANIZATION> Bexar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s office recovered about 25 small fragments and were conducting tests to determine if they were pieces of human flesh. Officers searched several areas of the city for body parts, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` There are indications of the body being dumped somewhere,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We've searched several specific areas of town, but have not found the body.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Baughman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> had lived in the house for about eight months. Ms. <PERSON> Baughman </PERSON> was unemployed, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Her parents, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velma </PERSON> <PERSON> Baughman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION> told police they had not seen her in eight years.

<HEAD>Magazine: Astronauts May Have Survived Blast, Died On Impact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The crew aboard the space shuttle Challenger, which exploded 72 seconds into flight, may have survived the blast and lived the two-and-a-half minutes it took the craft to crash into the ocean, a magazine reported. Tropic, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s Sunday magazine, quoted anonymous <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> investigators who said the seven crew members, including schoolteacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, survived the blast and died only when the cabin, possibly still pressurized, slammed into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> at 200 mph. `` If it had landed softly, they could have swam home,'' said one of the investigators. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has maintained the astronauts died the instant the spacecraft exploded. The space agency also has said that if the crew cabin had survived the blast intact, it would have been ripped apart by aerodynamic forces upon its descent. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment when contacted Saturday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after advance copies of the magazine became available. The magazine reported that no evidence was ever found that the cabin lost pressure, and if it did, it did so slowly, without the sudden, catastrophic loss of air that would have knocked the astronauts out within seconds. The astronauts would have remained conscious long enough to catch a glimpse of the ocean rushing toward them if the compartment was losing pressure slowly, <ORGANIZATION> Tropic </ORGANIZATION> reported. The free-fall lasted about two-and-a-half minutes. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s official report indicated no cause of death could be determined from the remains, which were found entangled in the crushed cabin on the ocean floor nearly six weeks later. Death certificates issued from the Johnson Space Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Jan. 30, two days after the tragedy, certified that the astronauts `` died when the shuttle spacecraft Challenger ... exploded.'' Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, chief assistant to the medical examiner in <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> and the Kennedy Space Center are located, told the magazine those certificates are useless because of the date, and because they were not signed, as legally required, by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> says the public may never learn exactly how the astronauts died because <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> intentionally kept the remains from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> pathologists, whose records would be public. `` The law does n't say we're allowed to do the autopsies,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said. `` It says we are required to do them. `` The government does this kind of thing, always with no thought as to the outcome. `` Look what happened with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Instead of doing the straightforward pathology work right there in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, they did all this cloak-and-dagger stuff and now, 23 years later, there are questions that can never be answered _ questions that should n't even exist, because if the autopsy had been done correctly, they would all have been answered.''

 Eighty-nine people who took refuge in a cathedral building vowed Saturday to remain on a hunger strike until demonstrators detained in opposition protests are freed, activists said. Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he had received another invitation from Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> for a meeting to remove obstacles to government-opposition talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. He said he had not decided on a reply. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said in a nationwide television address Saturday night he believed the talks `` will in fact take place,'' but he gave no indication when. Police and demonstrators clashed in at least six cities Friday night as people chanting `` Independence!'' and `` Solidarity!'' marched to mark the 70th anniversary of the restoration of Polish independence in 1918. Poles in major cities turned out by the thousands in an outpouring of opposition sentiment. Demonstrations organized by Solidarity and the banned right-wing opposition group <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were reported in 14 cities. Some protesters chanted, `` The shipyard is ours!'' a reference to plans to close the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> where the Solidarity union federation was established in the fall of 1980. Solidarity was suspended by the commuinist authorities in December 1981 and outlawed the following year. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>, 89 people were in a building beside the Christ the King Cathedral where they had taken shelter late Friday during fighting between police and protesters, activist leaders reported. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON>, a member of the Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> who was among the protesters, said in a telephone interview the group was receiving blankets and sleeping bags from sympathizers. Opposition spokesmen said about 250 people ran into the cathedral complex after police attacked demonstrators with clubs. They said 89 began a hunger strike. The strikers are demanding the release of the detainees as well as punishment for police who beat protesters and written assurances that those in the cathedral building will not face repression, activist <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON> said. Another Solidarity spokesman, <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Maziarski </PERSON>, said 18 people were injured Friday night and 46 detained in confrontations with police. A few of those detained were released Saturday, he said. Protests Friday also turned violent in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tarnow </PERSON>, opposition spokesmen said. There was no immediate official word on the number of people detained or injured in the confrontations nationwide, but it appeared at least 100 were held for some time.

 Just as you are what you eat, archaeologist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathje </PERSON> believes you are _ to a certain extent _ what you throw away. <PERSON> Rathje </PERSON> has some of his students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> learning more than they might want to know about garbage. They sift through trash in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and dig into landfills around the nation to get the true picture of modern society _ or as <PERSON> Rathje </PERSON> puts it, `` to see the American lifestyle from the back end.'' `` We do run across some bad stuff, but you just put on your gloves, hold your nose and get through it as fast as you can,'' said <PERSON> Rathje </PERSON>, who spoke recently at a conference of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> for the Environment. <PERSON> Rathje </PERSON> said a lot can be learned about people and society from what is thrown away. A lot of myths can be dispelled, too. One of those myths, he said, is that Americans eat everything on their plates. `` The average household throws out 15 percent of the food it buys. In <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, that is 950 tons of edible food a year,'' he said. `` We dug up a T-bone steak from 1970 that, I swear, if we brushed the dirt off and cooked it, you would eat it,'' he said. His students determined the steak came from 1970 by looking at newspapers and other dated items nearby.

 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, in a speech issued Saturday, denounced the Soviet-led invasion that ousted him as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and said his nation needs `` a great popular leap'' forward. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> is scheduled to give the speech Sunday at a ceremony in which he will be honored for the reforms he introduced in 1968 during a period that became known as the `` Prague Spring.'' He is on his first visit abroad since he was stripped of his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> membership in 1970, and he has expressed concern the government might not let him return home because of his statements in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Speaking of the invasion in 1968 that crushed his reforms and established a hardline government, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said in his prepared speech: `` It is my firm conviction that without the external intervention in the situation of our party and our Czechoslovak society, our endeavor would have been crowned with success.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> is to receive an honorary degree in political science Sunday from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION>, which is marking its 900th birthday. The university made his speech available Saturday. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> lamented the invasion but expressed hope that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> will again try to introduce elements of democracy. `` It would be enough to have a great popular leap, which among other things, was our movement of rebirth in 1968, in order that our historical experiences so profoundly lived return to the surface and be openly manifested,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who considers himself a communist although he was stripped of party membership, said the last two decades in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> were years of `` economic stagnation, sterility and incalculable moral losses.'' But he added he still had hope, saying: `` We are searching for something that can open the path to new developments of socialism _ theoretical and practical.'' `` In the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring, in its internal development and in its suffocation by external forces, everything is reflected in condensed form _ the crises and the possibilities of socialism,'' his speech declared. `` In 1968 we learned that the key to overcome the crisis does n't only come in the economic sphere ... the key was, and remains, in the political sphere.'' The 66-year-old <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION> Friday by car. He lives in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> and is retired from a lowly job in a forestry department office that was assigned to him 18 years ago. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> served for five months in 1970 as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> but then was summoned back to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and ousted him from the party He had been removed as party leader in April 1969. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> is expected to remain about 10 days in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> visiting <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ravenna </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. No schedule has been released.

 Thousands of Israelis demonstrated Saturday for reforms in the electoral system that enabled 15 parties to gain seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but gave none enough power to form a government. The fragmented results of the Nov. 1 elections have forced Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to make concessions to religious parties in return for their joining a coalition with his rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. Both <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and its rival, the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, need the support of the religious parties to form a majority in the 120-member parliament. Under heavy rains, some 15,000 protesters gathered in <LOCATION> Malchei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> square in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, carrying posters calling for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor to form a temporary coalition for the sole purpose of passing an electoral reform bill. The demonstrators carried blue-and-white <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags, and some wore buttons that said, `` I am secular and I am scared.'' The slogan referred to potential religious rulings that the small Orthodox parties could force on the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> government if they become coalition partners. The protesters hope new elections can be held as soon as a new electoral system is in place. Under the proposed reform bill, voters would select a candidate for prime minister rather than vote for a party. The majority of the members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would be elected in regional elections. `` I am sure the message coming from all these thousands of people will have an effect,'' said <PERSON> Uriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which sponsored the rally. Under the present electoral system, the head of the party winning the most Parliament seats becomes prime minister, provided he is able to form a coalition. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the Nov. 1 elections and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 39. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> made a major concession to the religious parties Friday when he promised an amendment to the `` Who-is-a-Jew'' law, which defines who is Jewish and thus eligible for automatic Israeli citizenship. The Orthodox, who gained 18 seats altogether in the elections, want the law amended so that only Orthodox rabbis would be able to convert non-Jews to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. Those converted by non-Orthodox rabbis would not qualify for citizenship. Jewish leaders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where most Jews belong to the more liberal streams, have said the amendment could split the Jewish people.

 A $ 166 million lawsuit charges that four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> city council members damaged the city's image and financial stability by defying a federal desegregation order that led to huge fines against the city. The class-action lawsuit by 16 residents alleged that the four wasted taxpayers' money in violation of their oaths of office and state laws governing official conduct. Plans for the suit were announced in August, shortly after the four voted against endorsing a court-ordered plan to build low - and moderate-income housing in the state's fourth-largest city Lawyers said Friday they filed the suit earlier in the week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, who had found the city liable for 40 years of segregated housing and schools, had warned the council that failure to support the plan would lead to a finding of contempt. Vice Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, one of the four council members, said he might countersue. `` It's something in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to have somebody sue you to make you vote a certain way,'' he said. `` They're taking a page right out of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s book.'' The lawsuit seeks $ 40 million each from the four council members and $ 6 million jointly to pay for the contempt-of-court fine imposed because of their votes and the alleged damages suffered by <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, officials said Friday. The lawsuit also demands the removal or suspension of the four: <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, Minority Leader <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>. Sand found the four councilmen, as well as <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, in contempt on Aug. 2, and imposed fines against the city and against the four personally. The fine against the city was to escalate daily from $ 100; a federal appeals court capped it at $ 1 million. In the face of widespread city layoffs, <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> changed their positions the day the fine would have hit $ 1 million. `` The damages sustained by the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> ... during the period of contempt were horrendous,'' the lawsuit said. The `` willful misconduct'' of the four `` amounts to gross negligence and dereliction of duty, waste and illegal conduct.'' <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> paid a total of $ 819,000. Each of the four council members paid $ 43,500 in personal fines; they plan to go to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to challenge Sand's power to hold them in contempt personally. The damages sought by the lawsuit represent fines and fees for the time spent by lawyers dealing with the contempt issue, as well as damage to the city's ability to raise money by selling municipal bonds, its reputation, property values and tax rate. The lawsuit also seeks to bar City Manager <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the city's fiscal watchdog, from approving payments to lawyers representing the four councilmembers in their personal contempt cases.

The men ran to a metal fence beyond the ruts and began climbing with two, identified only as a 26-year-old metalworker and a 23-year-old mechanic, escaping. No information was given about the man captured by the East German guards. A West German police spokesman in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> said the escape occurred near the West German town of <LOCATION> Goettingen </LOCATION>, 110 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s top Jewish leader said Saturday he and other members of the Jewish community will hold a special meeting to deal with the bitter discord following a controversial speech on the Nazi era. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, chairman of the German <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jews </ORGANIZATION>, said the council's directorate would meet Wednesday to discuss the furor surrounding the speech by <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, who resigned Friday. Jenninger on Thursday delivered a parliamentary speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom on Nov. 9-10, 1938, a night of Nazi terror against Jews across <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In his address, <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> attempted to set the scene in the 1930s when <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> came to power, saying Germans initially found the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era `` glorious.'' His remarks touched off anger in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and abroad, with critics saying he had shown no remorse over the Nazi era. <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> defended himself by saying he was misunderstood. The left-leaning <PERSON> Frankfurter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundschau </PERSON> newspaper said Saturday that no one could accuse <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> of being a Nazi sympathizer, and noted his strong support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But the paper implied in a commentary that some conservative Germans have difficulties putting the Nazi era in perspective. `` He -LRB- Jenninger -RRB- did what has become fashionable among some conservatives in this republic: Without consideration for possible misunderstandings, they try desperately to put into perspective <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 12-year departure from the civilized world in such a way that the -LRB- Nazi -RRB- times may be explainable but their uniqueness is lost,'' the newspaper said. Also criticized in some quarters was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the Jewish council, who defended <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s address in a television interview. `` I welcome that the Parliament president described in full clarity what was happening in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> between 1933 and 1938 ... especially the fact that everything that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> did was strongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> said in the interview. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON>'s remarks angered many Jews. `` He has severely outraged the -LRB- Jewish -RRB- community in the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, and also in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Saturday. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> were already in a feud over <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON>'s opposition earlier this month to <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>'s wishes to address Parliament during the Kristallnacht observances AP attempted to reach <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> at his office in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> on Saturday telephone calls were not answered. A move by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> to invite <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> to speak at the observances in Parlilament was rejected on procedural grounds. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> reiterated on Saturday his criticism of <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech `` The whole address was a big mistake. The second-ranking official in our country has a certain responsibility,'' <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> said. `` This speech was given on the wrong day and at the wrong place.''

 Torrential rains again pounded most of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast Saturday, leaving three people dead, flooding roads and knocking out electricity and telephone services, police said.

Floods sent water rushing through Areyns de Mar, north of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, blocking roads with mud and damaging more than 100 cars, police said. Early Saturday, rains lashed the east coast of <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> province, causing rivers to overflow their banks and damaging numerous cars and buildings. Police found the bodies of a 30-year-old woman and her two young daughters who had been reported missing late Friday after the rushing waters of the <LOCATION> Turia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> swept their car off a road near <LOCATION> Liria </LOCATION>, 25 miles from <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. The bodies had been carried several hundred yards from where the car was found. The driver, the woman's husband, was unhurt, police said.

 First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says she has had to protect her husband against bad advice from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides pushing their own agendas, but she does n't see herself overstepping any boundaries. In a wide-ranging interview published in Sunday editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also discussed such issues as her frosty relations with <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, wife of the Soviet leader, and her estrangement from her daughter, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she felt `` hurt, surprised and disappointed'' by some actions of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staff members and acknowledged without apology that she wielded influence over her husband on some personnel decisions. `` I'm more aware if somebody is trying to end-run him and have their own agenda,'' she said. `` I'm more aware of that than he is. It just never occurs to him that anybody is going to do that.'' A prime example, she said, was the Iran-Contra affair. `` He did not know what was going on and that's not right,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. She was especially angry at former chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who in his book revealed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology and portrayed her as an interfering tyrant. The first lady said that when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> underwent colon cancer surgery, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wanted him to get up and attend a news conference in two weeks, a request Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she turned down. She said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> saw her as meddling. `` But a first lady is a wife, first of all,'' she said. `` I do n't care That comes first for me. I'm sure with everybody that comes first. And I certainly felt that for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s interest _ it was to his interest.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declined to elaborate further on her relationship with <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> or her interest in astrology, two matters she planned to discuss in her upcoming autobiography. As to her relationship with Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first lady said that cultural differences may have contributed to the testiness of their brief meetings and that `` by our standards'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could be considered rude. `` Now, by her standards, it may not be,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It's just coming from two completely different cultures and trying to get together for the first time and maybe one not understanding how the other works,'' she added. `` I think there was way too much attention paid about that whole thing.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became tearful when discussing her estrangement from her daughter, and said the two have n't spoken in more than a year. She said she hoped the estrangement would not be permanent. `` I mean, I'm her mother,'' she said, her eyes filling with tears. `` I hope not.''

<TEXT>
 An animal rights activist accused of planting a pipe bomb that police said could have killed an executive whose company uses dogs in medical experiments `` meant no harm,'' her father said Saturday. Neighbors of <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> described her as strange and said she often talked with animals. `` Of course she's innocent, she meant no harm,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON>, the woman's father, when contacted Saturday at his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. He refused further comment, except to say his daughter hoped to select an attorney by Tuesday. Her next-door neighbor, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON>, said, `` She was a sort of strange person. If you had to draw a profile of someone who was n't quite right, she'd be it.'' <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> police arrested Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> just after midnight Friday and planned to hold her through the weekend under $ 500,000 bond pending arraignment in Superior Court Monday on charges of attempted murder, possession of explosives and manufacturing a bomb. Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> is accused of planting a powerful, radio-controlled bomb in bushes at the <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, near the parking space of company chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. The bomb was wrapped with roofing nails, which would have acted as projectiles. About 200 people were working in the plant overnight at the time of the incident. A search of the woman's basement apartment turned up three more homemade bombs fashioned from standard plumbing pipes, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police Deputy Inspector <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarone </PERSON>. Police said the bombs were made of large firecrackers, called M-80s, wrapped with nails and BB pellets and stuffed into pipes. The devices `` certainly would have destroyed the entire building'' and damaged surrounding houses, <PERSON> Tarone </PERSON> said. Several hundred residents near Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> were evacuated for several hours Friday afternoon while police searched the apartment. Police also found a sawed-off shotgun, a homemade weapon described as a cross between a bazooka and a shotgun, and pictures of animal torture in her apartment. Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> also rents a garage in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where police found several emaciated dogs she apparently was trying to nurse back to health. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollomon </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> would face charges of criminal possession of a dangerous weapon and possibly other charges. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also was investigating the incident `` as a possible terrorist act and for several federal violations,'' police said. A neighbor, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> `` told one neighbor that she only speaks to dogs. She looked like a leftover hippie from the'60s,'' the Daily News reported. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, who lives down the block, told <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday: `` She used to always talk to my dog when I walked him, but not to me. She'd say weird things to the dog, like ask him questions and wait for an answer.'' Police staked out the company, which produces surgical stapling devices, after receiving information that it might be the target of violence, <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> was carrying a radio-controlled detonator for the bomb when she was arrested, <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Surgical conducts experiments on about 1,000 animals, mostly dogs, a year, <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said. The animals, which are obtained from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> farms, are destroyed after experiments are completed, he said.

 A federal prosecutor finished his closing arguments Saturday in the racketeering trial of reputed mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and 16 associates. `` The cloak of innocence has been removed,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON>. `` The evidence has stripped that cloak and established beyond reasonable doubt that these defendants are guilty.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, 59, of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is the head of the mob in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> area. He is accused with the other 16 men of participating in a racketeering conspiracy that included nine murders, four attempted murders, extortions, drug dealing, loansharking and illegal gambling. `` The Mafia system says that might is right, and violence will prevail,'' <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON> said. `` This is not the American justice way. The government has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system of law will not bow to intimidation. Might is not right. `` As a juror, you must show strength, independence, and courage, and set aside bias and fear,'' <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON> said. `` For the American system of justice to work, there is only one verdict for you to return and only one word.'' `` Guilty.'' <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, the first of the 17 defense attorneys to give a closing argument, attacked the credibility of the government's main witnesses, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON>, ex-gangsters turned government informants. `` Those guys told fairy tales. It's not worthy of belief,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. During the prosecution summation <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> sat beside his attorney, showing little emotion as he listened to <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON> describe him as `` a cold-blooded paranoid killer -LRB- who led -RRB- a band of urban outlaws -LRB- and -RRB- settled disputes by bloodletting, violence and intimidation.'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> asked the jurors not to make up their minds until they hear from the remaining 16 defense lawyers who will present closing arguments next week. Judge <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> VanAntwerpen </PERSON> adjourned the court until Monday morning.

 Children at risk of failing in school should be helped at the preschool level, a group of educators said Saturday. The Council of Chief State School Officers, which is meeting through Monday, said states must reach disadvantaged children earlier and increase parents' involvement with their preschool children. `` The council believes the single most important investment to be made in education is the provision of high-quality programs for the nation's youngest children who are most at risk and for their families,'' the statement said. Good early-childhood programs are linked to success in school, the council said. Pre-kindergarten programs should begin at age 3, the statement said.

 Athletes were huffing and puffing on weight machines Saturday, lifting legs, pumping pectorals and building biceps _ all with the never-failing encouragement of an electronic coach. `` I really like your effort, hang in there,'' says <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>. `` Two more _ control your breathing.'' `` Harry'' is part of <LOCATION> Powercise </LOCATION>, a new system on display this weekend at Club Industry'88, a trade show of the latest machines, gadgets, computer programs, health foods and clothing designed to keep people coming back to health clubs when their interest in exercise is waning. Between seminars with titles such as `` The Future of Racquetsports'' and `` Why People Join,'' more than 3,000 health club proprietors and purveyors of fitness equipment milled among the products Saturday, trying out the stationary cycles, the headsets for aerobics instructors and the relaxation machines. `` This is like having your own personal coach,'' says <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>, who sells <PERSON> Powercise </PERSON> for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> LivingWell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They really do have their own personalities _ <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> over here on the <LOCATION> Pec </LOCATION> Deck is French, so he has a little accent.'' The theory behind the talking exercise machines, she says, is to push people who might not otherwise go into a health club _ or who might not continue to work out after they join. `` We're not interested in the bodybuilders, we're interested in the masses,'' Ms. <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> says. But if the intent of the machinery is to take inches off your stomach and thighs, most of the products displayed would also take inches off your wallet. <PERSON> Powercise </PERSON>, for example, goes for $ 60,000. A similarly equipped system by Universal, with no electronic coach, will set you back $ 80,000. And for only $ 690, <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naparima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sells a body composition analysis meter and IBM-compatible software program that he says will tell health club patrons what percent of their weight is fat _ which can be used to show them the progress they have made after dieting and exercise. `` The way to keep people interested and keep them coming back to the health club is to show them progress,'' Organ said. At the Telecycle display, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Middleburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> hawks a $ 2,495 stationary cycle with a videotape that makes you think you're riding behind a group of riders in races such as the Tour de France `` What our business is is providing entertainment and motivation,'' <PERSON> Kemon </PERSON> says. `` What we're trying to do is involve people in this travel.'' Further down the aisle, four customers sit in shiny white, egg-shaped chairs, listening to an'80s version of the <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> course and watching waves, flowers and birds on a large television screen. `` Feel the nurturing energy of the midday sun,'' a deep voice croons, waves crashing and soft music playing in the background. `` Let the colors and sounds take you back to a personal memory. ... Travel deeper into your center.'' After five minutes in an Alpha Chamber, sold by Sensory Environment Engineers of <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for $ 13,800 per chair with a TV, video recorder and 50 tapes, most adults `` access 80 percent of their potential for relaxation,'' said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Velinka </PERSON> <PERSON> Udicki </PERSON>. She says the chairs are being tried out at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and at the Olympic Training Center in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and that the company has already sold thousands to health clubs, spas and even corporations looking for quick and easy relaxation for stressed-out executives. `` The 80s are definitely a time of physical fitness,'' Ms. <PERSON> Udicki </PERSON> says. `` But the 90s are going to be a time of balance between mental and physical fitness.''

 The government newspaper on Saturday accused the opposition daily of trying to block international aid for damage inflicted by Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> by saying the government is lying about the extent of the damage. The opposition paper, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, charged Friday that the government was planning to use the aid for the military, not to help the thousands left homeless when <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> struck <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> also accused the Sandinistas of `` demanding'' aid from the diplomatic community and said they had `` asked for too much'' and `` in a bad way.'' Barricada, the official paper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday in an editorial that the damage from the hurricane was even worse than first thought. The newspaper linked <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>'s charges to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been backing anti-Sandinista rebels since 1982.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will bring the intelligence community's `` unique perspective'' with him to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but that knowledge will have little effect on the functions of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the agency's deputy director said Saturday. `` Obviously, it is a unique circumstance. We have never had a president who has served as head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> before,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` He brings a knowledge ... perspective no other president has.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was interviewed by reporters here during a visit along with Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was being inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame by the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said the president-elect's familiarity with the agency's operation may make him more `` demanding'' of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said, however, that he does not expect the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to take a more active or visible role in the intelligence community while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in office. `` First of all, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is not a policy-making agency,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` We are there primarily to collect information, analyze it, evaluate it and provide it to the president and his senior policy officials to help inform their decisions.'' `` We do not make that policy. We do not recommend policy and certainly there will be no changes in that.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, a 22-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> who was appointed deputy director by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said he does not know if he will be re-appointed, but probably would leave the agency if new leadership were brought in. The White House has asked for resignations from all political appointees so that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can `` put his own stamp on things.'' The transition team has not indicated whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to replace <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief appointed to head the agency after <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> died in May 1987. `` It is very important that the president have a director of central intelligence that he is comfortable with and I think Judge <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> has done a fine job,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` And as I said before, we all serve at the pleasure of the president.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> also said he does not expect the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to treat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> any different than other presidents because of his CIA background. `` They have had the opportunity to interact with him for a long time and in a variety of different positions,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it will have any impact.''

<HEAD>Nation's First Woman Episcopal Bishop Rejected By Dallas Diocese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's first female Episcopal bishop has been denied affirmation of ordination by the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, church officials said. The Rev. <PERSON> C.V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westapher </PERSON>, parish priest of the Church of the Incarnation and president of the committee, said Friday that the vote was 3-2 on Tuesday, with one abstention, against the proposed consecration of the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a priest from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 58, was elected last month by the Diocese of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in September as suffragan, or assistant bishop of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Before she can be consecrated, however, her election must be approved by a majority of the 118 diocesan bishops and their standing committees. The failure of either group to give majority consent voids the election. <PERSON> Westapher </PERSON> said he could not predict how other standing committees in the church would vote. No election in anyone's memory has been overturned, he said. The Rev. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration has been set for early February. From the outset, her election was controversial among traditionalists who oppose the ordination or consecration of women as priests and bishops. All but a handful of dioceses, however, have ordained women as priests. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> committee is made up of three clergy and three laity members. Westapher, noting that the church has many black bishops, said race was never an issue in the committee's discussion. The Rev. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is black. Because he is the only conservative on the committee, <PERSON> Westapher </PERSON> said, he was the only one who raised the issue of her being a woman as a barrier to elevation. One member found her divorce a problem, he said. The committee based its judgment on what members considered the Rev. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' lack of qualifications. He said politics was involved in electing her over others who he said were `` much better qualified.'' `` Do n't misunderstand us,'' he said. `` She is brilliant. But she never went to college or had structured seminary training. That is part of the discipline of preparation for the ministry _ whether it be for a deacon, priest or the episcopacy.'' Last month, bishops of six of the 99 dioceses of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> denounced her election as the first female bishop in the world-wide Anglican communion. The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is one of 28 national branches of that communion. Declaring that the Anglican faith would be `` irrreparably compromised'' if <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> were consecrated a bishop, the six bishops said they `` can not accept the validity of ordinations or confirmations she administers.''

 The bodies of four elderly people were unearthed near a boardinghouse, one wrapped `` like a mummy'' in a table cloth, and police said the victims' Social Security checks had been stolen and cashed regularly. Police were looking for the manager of the boarding home, <PERSON> Dorthea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, late Saturday, said police Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Enloe </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON>, 71, was not prevented from walking away from the well-kept Victorian house earlier in the day, but police later decided they had sufficient evidence to arrest her for investigation of homicide. `` We do not believe she acted alone,'' <PERSON> Enloe </PERSON> said. `` Someone else probably had knowledge of what was going on.'' He did not elaborate, except to say that robbery was believed to be the motive. Police said victims' Social Security checks were cashed apparently after their deaths. <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> was convicted in 1982 of grand theft in a case stemming from charges she drugged three elderly people and took their possessions after meeting them in bars, police said. The remains of an elderly woman wrapped `` like a mummy, all the way up and around her head'' were discovered Friday when police received a tip there was a body buried in the yard, <PERSON> Enloe </PERSON> said. The other bodies were discovered Saturday, one in a plastic bag, and digging was expected to continue for several more days, police said. Police did not release the victims' names, but said the elderly woman may have been buried since April. The victims did not meet violent deaths, <PERSON> Enloe </PERSON> said. Police went to the house on Monday after neighbors reported that former tenant <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> had been missing since August. There were eight rooms for tenants in the house, and at least three people were living there this week, police said. The bodies were found in the back yard and along both sides of the house. Several recently planted trees had to be removed and a gazebo in the back yard torn down to uncover the graves, said <PERSON> Enloe </PERSON>.

 Police arrested about 200 anti-abortion protesters nationwide Saturday as they tried to prevent women from entering clinics, while demonstrations were held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to support a woman's right to undergo the procedure. The anti-abortion protests were held in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION>. The `` pro-choice'' demonstrations were in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb, where 22 people were arrested. The <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> demonstrations involved both sides when pro-choice activists prevented anti-abortion activists from leaving a church by putting a metal gate across the exit. The anti-abortion activists later were freed to go to their own demonstration, where 56 of them were arrested. The protests were peaceful, although one of the 15 people arrested in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly blocking a police van. Sixty-five people were arrested in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. The anti-abortion demonstrators were supporters of Operation Rescue, which held protests in about two dozen cities Oct. 30. Those protests were linked to a continuing abortion protest in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that began when the Democratic National Convention was held there in July and has resulted in 1,200 arrests. In <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, police said it took about two-and-a-half hours to remove demonstrators from the downtown office building housing Affiliated Medical services. Some demonstrators sat wall-to-wall on the floor of the eighth floor hallway, singing hymns and praying. When people tried to pass, the protesters rose to their knees and locked arms. Others marched and sang in the rain outside the building. The medical director of the clinic is Dr. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose house in <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, had been the subject of frequent protest marches before such picketing in the residential area was outlawed. Officers in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> said they recognized some of the protesters outside the Clinic for Women as people who had been arrested in previous demonstrations there. The demonstrators carried signs and quoted Bible verses to people at the clinic. `` We're trying to keep these mothers away from the door,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Believers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` We're trying to give them another minute or two minutes or a half hour to decide not to murder their baby.'' Women who needed to enter the clinic were assisted by volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, and clinic administrator <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON> said no women were kept from entering the building. `` This only infringes on something that is so personal and so private, which they -LRB- protesters -RRB- have no right to do,'' <PERSON> Stout </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, 57 people were arrested outside the Women's Advisory Center No injuries or property damage were reported, Sgt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. All 57 were given tickets to appear later in court on charges of disorderly conduct, punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $ 100 fine upon conviction, he said. About 150 pro-choice demonstrators picketed outside <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to protest police handling of recent anti-abortion blockades at clinics. `` They are aiding and abetting law breakers,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Laws </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> chapter president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. The protesters said that <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> police have failed to arrest or disband anti-abortion protesters who have blockaded abortion clinics recently. At an anti-abortion blockade last month in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, police arrested 81 protesters. The estimated 500 protesters were able to keep the clinic from admitting patients for two days, however. `` We're saying to the city that we want equal enforcement,'' said <PERSON> Marilynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckham </PERSON>, director of the clinic that was blockaded. `` We have been treated like the criminals.'' The demonstrators, who were watched closely but not interfered with by police, chanted: `` Our bodies, our lives, our right to decide,'' and `` Keep the clinics open, the law should not be broken,'' as well as other slogans.

 The murder case against a disbarred lawyer accused of beating his adopted daughter to death rests on circumstantial evidence, which can be a stumbling block with jurors, according to a legal expert.

 Wall Street wanted it, expected it and got it. But when a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory finally arrived, there was no celebration. Instead, investors sighed, then retreated. When all was said and done, the market acted more relieved that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not win, than pleased that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did. `` I do n't think anyone really wanted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>; he was the lesser of two evils,'' asserted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't know how to describe Wall Street's attitude,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, head of equity trading for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You heard more ` I'm glad <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't win' than ` I'm glad <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won. `` -LRB- The market's reaction -RRB- was relief that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not win,'' added <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said investors felt little like celebrating as they awoke to post-election reality and the same problems that had troubled the market in the period leading up to the vote _ interest rates, the dollar and the budget and trade deficits With the election over, the most immediate question was whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move to raise interest rates. Next was how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would reduce the massive federal budget deficit. Many analysts feared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had backed himself into a corner by vowing not to raise taxes. Then there was the question of the deteriorating dollar and how foreign investors would react. The currency got a downward shove early in the week from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, who suggested that a lower dollar would do more to extend the economic recovery and help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The weak dollar dragged down bonds and stocks. Added to those concerns was the newest question mark: Would <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> be able to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to solve all those problems? And intruding on an already nervous market were fears that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might move to put the brakes on leveraged buyouts. Those concerns emerged when Republican Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested at midweek that the deductibility of interest rates used for buyouts be eliminated. With little to soothe their shattered confidence, investors fled to the sidelines to sort out the prospects for the future. This post-election paralysis was reflected in a sharp decline in trading activity. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 138.62 million shares a day, down from 150.50 million the week before. On Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials suffered its worst one-day loss in nearly seven months, falling 47.66 points to 2,067.03. The last bigger loss was 101.46 points on April 14. The Dow industrial average's 78.77-point loss for the full week was the biggest since Aug. 8-12, when the blue-chip indicator dropped 81.61 points. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index lost 4.46 over the week to end at 151.24; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market lost 7.26 to end the week at 373.76; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 6.04 at 291.48. Analysts said the market's failure to respond to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory was in itself a message to the president-elect. `` OK, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, what do you have up your sleeve? That's what people want to know,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. For the near-term, analysts say investors need answers. They say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs to move quickly to eliminate the uncertainty that has pervaded Wall Street in the aftermath of his victory. `` The way he conducts himself and what he says between now and inauguration about how he's going to deal with the deficit and other concerns will make a difference in the market,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. Until those and other questions are resolved, investors could remain noncommittal. `` The market could stay in this trading range for a good amount of time,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.
