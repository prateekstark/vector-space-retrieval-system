 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s newly appointed justice minister resigned Friday under a barrage of criticism for accepting political donations from a company at the center of a major scandal. `` There is nothing wrong with politicians accepting donations made from the good will of their supporters,'' <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` However, as minister in charge of clearing up the Recruit problem in the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration, which is trying to heighten trust in government, it is regrettable that I received donations from Recruit. `` I apologize deeply and resign from my post as justice minister.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> accepted the resignation. Just Tuesday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> to handle a probe of a stock-profiteering scandal involving influential politicians and business leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The secretary general of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, said the administration may look outside government to replace <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>. He said a new minister probably would be named before the weekend. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> reshuffled his Cabinet on Tuesday in a move to rid his administration of any links to the scandal involving the purchase of unlisted stocks by a select number of individuals. On Thursday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> to look into the history of other new Cabinet members' ties to <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate at the center of the scandal. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> also accepted donations from Recruit. Two other new Cabinet members have acknowledged that Recruit bought tickets for their fund-raising parties. Opposition party leaders had demanded <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> fire <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> and said the prime minister should take responsibility for appointing <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> without checking whether he had ties with Recruit. `` Appointing a person related to the Recruit scandal as justice minister, who is in charge of investigation into the scandal, is out of the question. It is not something they can get away by saying they did not know,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaneko </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s secretariat. Influential politicians and business leaders were offered bargain-priced shares in <LOCATION> Recruit-Cosmos </LOCATION>, a Recruit real estate subsidiary, before they were listed for public sale. Share prices rose sharply after their public offering, and some shareholders made more than $ 80,000 in tax-free profits. Former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> heads the roster of 17 politicians and business leaders who resigned earlier in the scandal. A former Recruit official pleaded guilty to trying to bribe an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member to tone down his investigation. But <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>'s reported links with Recruit differed from the other cases. The day after <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s appointment, it was disclosed that his political support organization received $ 46,000 in membership dues from Recruit over 12 years. The latest donation of $ 3,800 came in October, about three months after the Recruit scandal erupted. On Thursday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> told him that accepting membership fees from Recruit `` lacked prudence, and I fully agree with him.'' But <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> added, `` I believe his ability will allow him to fulfill his responsibility as justice minister.'' The prime minister said earlier <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> would play a key role in promoting reform in political ethics and that <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> was the best man for the job. <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, 76, told a news conference Thursday he was `` truly careless'' in not knowing about the donations, but `` as justice minister I do n't think this matter will be an impediment.'' <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> first denied allegations about the donations, and then said they were made without his knowledge. But his son and secretary, <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, said he told his father about the donations as early as October. In forming his new Cabinet on Tuesday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> sought to put the Recruit scandal behind him. But critics link <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> himself to the scandal since one of his aides profited from sales of bargain Recruit shares. The prime minister has denied any personal involvement. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>'s support organization has been receiving $ 160 a month from Recruit, although it was not known for how long. It said <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>'s only comment was, `` We have been complying with the law in handling political donations.'' <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hata </PERSON>, the new agriculture minister, acknowledged that Recruit bought tickets for his fund-raising party in 1986, but did not disclose the amount. Another new Cabinet official, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged he received donations from Recruit for more than 10 years and that Recruit has bought tickets for his fund-raising parties. Like the stock transactions, the political donations were legal. But critics contend the stock deals were unethical and were donations in disguise. <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, general secretary of the largest opposition party, the Socialists, had demanded <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s resignation.

<TEXT>
 A quick-spreading outbreak of Chinese flu has ruined the holidays for tens of thousands of Italians, filled hospitals and clinics, and left many doctors sick in bed, Italian newspapers report. The outbreak surprised health officials, who had predicted the annual flu season would begin in January, according to news reports Wednesday. While health officials do not consider this year's virus, which they think originated in Chinese pigs, to be more severe than recent types, its timing has caused numerous problems. Throughout <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, family doctors, understaffed emergency rooms and clinics were unprepared for the onslaught of people seeking relief from the virus, which is considered dangerous only to infants and the elderly. There have been no reports of deaths in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from the flu. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, weekend calls to the city's main emergency center poured in at almost twice the normal rate. An estimated 15 percent of the city's doctors and 35 percent of its nurses were unable to work, mostly due to the virus. Health officials in <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION> estimate that about 20,000 citizens remain in bed with symptoms of the flu, which include high fever, aching joints and the chills. Doctors have said the flu normally lasts three days and should be treated with rest, fluids, aspirin and vitamin C.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Picasso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, home for the past three years to nearly 3,500 works by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, is closing to the public for two months for repairs, a museum spokesman said. The refurbished 17th century mansion, known as the Hotel Sale after one of its former owners, opened as a museum in 1985 with the world's largest collection of works by the Spanish master who died in 1973. The 203 paintings, 158 sculptures and 3,000 drawings were taken by the French government from <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s heirs in lieu of death taxes, along with works by <ORGANIZATION> Matisse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON> in the artist's private collection. A spokesman said Wednesday that the repairs involved replacing the building's stone floors, which had proven `` too porous and fragile,'' to handle traffic from some 40,000 visitors monthly. The museum closes Saturday and reopens March 1.

 Ignore the wheelchair and arthritis. Her 80 years weigh lightly upon the mind and wit of M.F.K. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, whose gifts to the world of food and literature are still mounting. But shed a tear for the grand dame of gastronomy: <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> denies herself the pleasure she gives her army of admirers in the 17 books and scores of magazine pieces that for 50 years set a lean and spicy standard few can match. `` I never read anything I've written,'' she snapped. `` I do n't care to go back I never read a word of print about me or by me.'' She would n't argue with going back to being able to use her hands for typing. Fate has ruled that she must dictate into a tape recorder. There's no question of her not doing it. Writing is as important to her as air. `` I am compulsive about it,'' admitted the Michigan-born author, who wrote such tasty morsels as `` How to <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> a Wolf,'' `` The Gastronomical Me,'' `` Consider the Oyster'' and her pungent `` Alphabet for Gourmets.'' Chafing among cushions in her little wine-country house, she added, `` But it's like pulling teeth. It's just awful. I ca n't dictate to a person so I dictate secretly I do n't make many mistakes, you know. It's my newspaper training. ... I do n't have any errors once I get it down on paper, thank God.'' In 1937, the world's food writers discovered a tough new kid on the block when they eyed this paragraph leaping from the pages of `` Serve It Forth,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>' first book: `` The quails are an artful lure to the most refined of palates, and the rabbit stew, steaming, aromatic, is made just as tempting with an onion or two, pepper freshly ground, a little bacon and a dash of cheap, pure wine.'' A somewhat less literate reporter observed, `` It's a shame you do n't get to read your good stuff like that.'' She was not impressed. Others are. It was once said of her crisp prose: `` She writes about food as others do about love, but rather better. ... <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> writes not as a specialist but as a whole human being, spiky with prejudices, charming, short-tempered, well-traveled and cosmopolitan. ... She is a person, not a gourmet masked as a writer. Her passion comes from inside her.'' That was 35 years ago. Except for such indignities as two hip replacements, a corneal implant and the arthritis, nothing has changed, and she remembers everything between times _ three husbands, magazine pieces, the books that `` never made me any money,'' the travels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Of all her mates, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, `` my real husband was <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Dillwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> -RRB-.'' They lived in a stone house surrounded by a vineyard and garden in <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. It was there, she said, that she learned from her Italian Swiss neighbors to cook vegetables in their own juices `` with sweet butter or thick olive oil to encourage them a little; tomatoes and onions and sweet peppers and all the summer things.'' She credits her start in food-writing on an episode during prohibition when she was living in <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and her newspaperman father, <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, was teaching at a nearby college. She was working in a postcard shop. One afternoon she had a half-day off and decided to go the public library, where she found an Elizabethan cookbook on a table. `` It smelled so good ... the binding. I started writing,'' she said. She showed her writing to <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, the man who became her first husband. She had just turned 21 when they married, and 11 days later they set off to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and three years in Dijon, where he got his doctorate and she earned a degree at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dijon </ORGANIZATION>. Back in the states, her writing started making the rounds. At 26, she sold her first magazine story, `` The Standing and the Waiting,'' and it conjured visions, full of verbs and wide swaths of color. The most scholarly of her work is her translation of legendary gastronomer <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthelme </PERSON> <PERSON> Brillat-Savarin </PERSON>'s `` The Physiology of Taste,'' her favorite work. Smoothing her red polka-dot dress, she peered out the window of the small, busy house she has lived in for 18 years, craning to see who was coming to visit her next. They come all day long, for a few moments in her `` youthful'' presence. They come professionally or as friends, for interviews, a publisher's conference, a chat, advice or perhaps to drop off a particularly nice piece of cheese or share a plateful of the chincoteague oysters she loves so much. She calls her visitors `` strays and wayfarers.'' They sit with her near a large picture window in her <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> house on the edge of the old <LOCATION> Bouverie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Jack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> country. But in her eighth decade, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> is not overwhelmed with the way things have gone with the world. `` We're suicidal,'' declared the mother of two daughters. `` Our doom is sealed. I take a very dim view of us as a human race, the only one that kills itself and everything around it. ... We've poisoned the earth and the land and the water What else is there to poison? ... I do n't have any hope for us at all.'' We looked out on her green meadow, rolling to the trees, peaceful, and the harsh pronouncement seemed a long way away.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Stage Protest Inside East German Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A dozen environmentalists protesting East bloc air pollution erected two tents on the East German side of the border as Communist border guards watched without intervening, West German police said. Police said the activists staged the protest Wednesday just inside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> near where <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> meet. The environmentalists contend East German and Czechoslovak authorities are too lax in enforcing air pollution laws, resulting in harmful emissions that affect air quality in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as well. Twelve of them erected two tents just inside the East German frontier, but outside the fence that separates the two countries. They also released balloons with slogans such as `` Pollution knows no borders.'' West German police said East German border guards watched the developments from a distance, but did not intervene. Czechoslovak sentries also watched from their side of the border. Five other environmentalists stayed on West German territory as the protest continued late Wednesday.

 Mother and daughter were entombed in eternal night and their only food, a jar of jam, was gone. Tons of smashed concrete around them had become their prison. `` Mommy, I'm so thirsty, I want to drink,'' cried the 4-year-old girl <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> said she was trapped flat on her back. A prefabricated concrete panel 18 inches above her head and a crumpled water pipe above her shoulders kept her from standing. She wore only a slip, and it was horribly cold. Beside her in the darkness lay the lifeless body of her sister-in-law, <PERSON> Karine </PERSON>. She had been crushed by falling walls, and died pinned beneath rubble one day after the Dec. 7 earthquake leveled much of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and other towns in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` Mommy, I need to drink,'' sobbed Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON>. `` Please give me something.'' `` I thought my child was going to die of thirst,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>, 26, recalled. `` I had no water, no fruit juice, no liquids. It was then I remembered that I had my own blood.'' Although she was trapped in darkness, she could slide on her back from side to side. Her groping fingers, numb from the cold, found a shattered glass. She sliced open her left index finger with a shard and gave it to her daughter to suckle. The drops of blood were n't enough. `` Please, Mommy, some more. Cut another finger,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> remembers her daughter saying. The woman made more cuts in her flesh, feeling nothing because of the bitter cold. She put her hand to her child's mouth, squeezing her fingers to make more blood come. `` I knew I was going to die,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> said. `` But I wanted my daughter to live.'' Many stories of courage have emerged from the earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but few, if any, are as touching or harrowing as the tale <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> told this week in a soft voice from her <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital bed. Around 11:30 a.m. on the day of the quake, she said the two were driven by Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Gerkham </PERSON>, a shoemaker, to the apartment building on <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Karine </PERSON> lived. Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>, a petite woman with thick black hair and curving eyebrows, wanted to try on a black dress with puffed shoulders that <PERSON> Karine </PERSON> had for sale. It fit her perfectly. As she took it off at 11:41 a.m., the fifth-floor apartment began to tremble, then shake violently. Dressed only in a slip and her underwear, she grabbed <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON>, wearing a heavy winter sweater, and ran to the door. Then the floor opened up and the 36-unit building collapsed. The three fell into the basement, with the nine-story building crumbling around them. Although trapped on her back, Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> found a 1 -LCB- - pound jar of blackberry jam that had fallen to the basement from <PERSON> Karine </PERSON>'s On the second day of their captivity _ the day <PERSON> Karine </PERSON> died of her injuries _ she gave the entire jar to <LOCATION> Gayaney </LOCATION> to eat. Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> said she found a skirt, perhaps the one she had tried on, and made a bed for <LOCATION> Gayaney </LOCATION> to lie on. Despite the bitter cold, she took off her stockings, and wrapped them around her daughter to keep her warm.

 As the days passed, and <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON>'s pleas for something to drink become more pressing, her mother remembered something she had seen on television. `` It was a program about an explorer in the Arctic who was dying of thirst. His comrade slashed open his hand and gave his friend his blood,'' she said. Losing track of time because of the unchanging darkness, Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> does n't know what day she cut open her fingers, or how many times she used the method to feed her daughter. Her thoughts wandered. She saw scenes of her life pass before her eyes, and she hallucinated. `` When I closed my eyes and opened them again, I could see boxes full of apples and bottles of lemonade,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> recalled. `` I told my daughter, ` My child, there are so many things to eat and drink.' But when I reached out to touch them, they were gone.'' <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON> cried that she wanted to go home. `` I want to be back in my bed again, and see my daddy,'' she said. `` I lost all hope,'' the mother said. `` I was just waiting for death.'' On Dec. 14, the eighth day of their captivity, rescue workers opened a small hole that let in a shaft of light. `` We're saved!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> cried. `` There's a child in here, be careful not to hurt her!'' she screamed as they got closer. Her husband, a shoemaker, was uninjured by the quake. He was with the rescuers and the two tearfully embraced. Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> was placed on a stretcher. Mother and daughter were flown to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, 60 miles away. <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON> was taken to Children's Hospital No. 3, Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON> to the Armenian national hospital. <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON> was in intensive care for four days, hooked up to intravenous bottles that dripped liquids into her parched body. Her temperature was dangerously low, her blood alarmingly thick and she was in shock, said Dr. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Nersesyan </PERSON>, her physician. The girl also was in a deep state of depression, and would n't talk or smile. Mrs. <PERSON> Petroysan </PERSON>, also dehydrated, was given intravenous fluids and placed in a coffin-like box so that pressurized oxygen could be pumped around her as a treatment against exposure. It was then that doctors discovered that the woman, who also has a 7-year-old son who was not hurt in the earthquake, is two months' pregnant Doctors say both mother and daughter could be released from their hospitals in as little as a week, but differ about whether Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>'s blood helped keep <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON> alive. `` For a child, the concentration of liquids in the body is much more important than for an adult,'' <PERSON> Nersesyan </PERSON> said. `` For <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON>, her mother's blood played an important, perhaps decisive role.'' Dr. <PERSON> Ripsime </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsadanyan </PERSON>, who treated Mrs. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>, disagrees. `` <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> lost a very little, even insignificant amount of blood. What saved them was that they were together. The mother did n't have time to panic. She had to think of her child.'' <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON> is still weak and has a light case of pneumonia. But the girl with the big, dark eyes has started to talk again and to smile. In her hospital bed, she strings colored yarn through cardboard dolls and plays with a teddy bear _ Christmas gifts that <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the son of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, gave her when he visited the hospital Sunday. <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON> is too young to understand what happened to her the day she was buried alive. `` Bad people pulled down the house where we were, and we could n't get out,'' she said `` I wanted my father to come and defend us from those bad people. But he did n't come. Not for a long time.''

 As <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> enjoys a marked thaw in restrictions on cultural debate, an intense, voluble man with no political stature and little fame has launched a one-man crusade to open up debate on democracy and communist rule. Sexual themes now can be portrayed on canvas and the screen, and economists can question the wisdom of state ownership of factories. But suggestions for limits to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s power are an invitation for arrest. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON>, a thin, shaggy-haired accountant who rarely laughs, knows it. He spent 1979-83 in prison for having advocated multiparty democracy, and after a long silence renewed his call last month with an open letter to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a 22-page essay on freedom. This week, he began distributing among foreign journalists four new essays denouncing the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as a narrow-minded bully and appealing to the world at large to show concern for human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` If one just thinks about things and does n't have the freedom to speak out, then there's no freedom,'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> wrote in one essay, explaining his motivation. Aware that his own arrest now would prove the point, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> wrote in another, `` I appeal to the power of international society for protection.'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, an accountant, said in an interview that he spends most of his non-working hours writing essays and plans to distribute batches of them each month to foreign and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> media. He said he does not expect to persuade the government to change, but wants to stimulate public debate and make <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political prisoners better known abroad, as are the dissidents in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> also is indignant that, as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> celebrates the 10th anniversary of its opening to the outside world and economic reform under senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, activists who advocated many of the same reforms remain in jail. Those jailed, like himself, were leaders of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall Movement. During those few heady months, intellectuals debated politics in home-mimeographed journals and posters pasted on a wall in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, dubbed Democracy Wall. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> insisted they had an impact, despite their eventual silencing. `` If one says that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> society has progressed over 10 years and the economy has grown greatly, all of this is because Chinese social reformers paid the painful price of sacrificing their freedom and fortune,'' he wrote. `` Without their brave spirit, could Chinese have as much freedom of discussion and modernization as they have today? Would the ruling authorities have voluntarily granted this?'' Such Democracy Wall themes as the need for multicandidate elections, greater contact with the outside world and policies to end <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s backwardness have since been adopted by the government. `` Where then is the crime?'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> wrote. Despite thick glasses and a solemn manner, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> looks younger than his 44 years. His work at as an accountant at a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> equipment installation company is not demanding, he said, but he has been given no chances for promotion. Officials have refused to transfer his wife's residence permit from <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, 75 miles away. She lives illegally in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with him, making it impossible for her to find work. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said he has not told his 12-year-old daughter that he was in prison. His essays are closely argued outpourings of personal frustration and outraged principles. In one, he denounced communist authorities as `` narrow-minded ... They fear the general public but bully small groups of people.'' He also denounced the practice of bypassing the courts for misdemeanor cases and allowing police to hand out sentences for `` labor education.'' `` There is no way to appeal in court, and covzr-ups, false arrests and illegalities are hidden,'' he wrote. `` Why does n't <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even respect its own regulations?'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON>, who never was tried, was ordered to undergo labor education but actually spent his four years in jail `` without labor and without education,'' he said. Newly emerged from his long silence and without a wall or journal to proclaim his views, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> seems uncertain how to proceed. He said he has no plans to go to campuses and address <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most volatile and receptive sector _ the students _ or to start up a publication. So far, neither his employers nor police have questioned him about his new political activity. `` I'm not alone. Many people agree with me,'' he said. But he is at a loss to explain why he is the only one stepping into the dangerous limelight. `` I've always been a free-thinker,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Has Powerful Weapon To Negotiate Trade
Accords</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A little-known deal between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should make it easier for President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reach agreements with the rest of the world on tough trade issues such as the current dispute over hormones in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef. Beginning Sunday, the 12 countries of the European Economic Community are banning all imports of meat treated with hormones _ including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and veal worth about $ 100 million a year. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration promised to retaliate by raising duties on European food shipped here. Counterretaliations and counter-counterretaliations are threatened, in what some see as a potential trade war. Over the long run such conflicts can be limited by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> using the `` fast track'' for making trade agreements. A series of agreements is being drafted by 96 governments in the current `` <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round'' of trade talks. Despite its name, the fast track is less important for its speed than for the power its gives the president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the latest version into law last August as part of a major trade bill. On Wednesday he issued an executive order on regulations to implement the new law. It associates key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> closely with trade talks, though not as actual negotiators. After an agreement is reached, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is pledged to vote it up or down in 90 days _ no exceptions or conditions, no internal bargaining over details. That differs from the usual relations between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Often the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> bargain for months or even years over what goes into an important bill before it becomes law _ or fails. The fast track allows the administration to make promises that are bound to be unpopular in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, such as ending protection for a small industry against foreign competition. Under the fast track system the negotiators can gamble that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will accept the entire agreement, even if many members dislike parts of it. Governments of other countries long have complained that they can not get firm commitments from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator. They can make firm promises themselves because the French or Japanese prime ministers, for example, can threaten to dissolve parliament and force members to fight a new election unless his promises are supported. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president ca n't do that. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, who negotiated for presidents from <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, tells a story about <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Keynes </PERSON>, the famous economist who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to get more aid for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in World War II. <PERSON> Keynes </PERSON> was annoyed to hear one official after another explain how <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> favored many measures but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not approve them. <PERSON> Keynes </PERSON> dropped his usual politeness when one American, more pompous than the others, began by saying: `` My government _ `` `` You know,'' Kenyes interrupted, `` you people do n't really have a government at all, in the usual sense of the word.'' Many officials, Americans and non-Americans, fail to grasp the difference between the American system and the parliamentary system. Non-Americans often complain that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has gone back on a pledge when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator promises his best effort to get something done and then <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ not operating on the fast track _ refuses to do it. Some blamed President <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> for World War II because he negotiated for a League of Nations after World War I and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to join it. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> failed to bring key senators close to the negotiations. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> identified the inventor of the fast track as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was trying to negotiate what was first called the `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> round'' of trade agreements. The White House asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a law that would give him almost unlimited power to negotiate, but allow either house to disapprove the result. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said in an interview that he will always remember former Sen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, D-Ga., a key member of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, fiery reaction to that proposal: `` That's not the way we make our laws in this country. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> since has ruled that such `` legislative vetoes'' are unconstitutional. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> wrote a memorandum that devised the fast track for <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> and it became law as part of the president's authority to negotiate. It was used under <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and President Ford to complete what became known as the `` <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> round'' after <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned. Later versions of the fast track have been used under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to negotiate free trade agreements with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In a recent book, `` Beyond Globalism,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> has proposed widening it. `` There is a strong temptation to look for a mechanism in which the main lines of trade policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy and establishment policy will have been jointly explored between the branches in an effort to identify the key assumptions, establish the principal goals and iron out the gross inconsistencies,'' he wrote. But he added that it is difficult to envision an effective dialogue between the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on so wide a range of issues. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, 75 years old, has retired as a professor of international relations at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. His book was written with <PERSON> Debora </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spar </PERSON>, who was studying for a doctorate there.

<HEAD>Ag Officials Worry That Low Soil Moisture Will Hurt 1989 Harvest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It will be months before the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> begins to estimate the size of 1989 farm crops, but analysts are watching carefully how weather and conditions shape up. Effects of the savage 1988 drought and moisture-sapping heat are still being felt in Corn Belt areas badly deficient in subsoil moisture. Corn and soybeans wo n't be planted until spring, so there's some leeway. But for winter wheat farmers who planted their 1989 crop this fall, the crunch is on right now. And in parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> the news is far from encouraging. `` Winter wheat fields in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> continued to show signs of moisture stress,'' the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Wednesday. `` Greenbug infestation was a continuing problem.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> farmers have been spraying to control the greenbugs, and much of the winter wheat crop in the state also is hurting from lack of moisture. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the wheat crop was in `` mostly good'' condition during the week of Dec. 19-25, but more snow cover was needed, the report said. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s winter wheat was reported in `` mostly fair to good'' shape, and the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> crop was said to be in `` mostly good'' condition, although <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphids continued to be a problem in the eastern part of the state. The farm weather facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce departments. On Jan. 13 the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> will issue a report showing how many acres of winter wheat farmers planted for the 1989 harvest, and there will be `` projections'' of potential harvest output based on past trends, weather indications and other factors. However, the department's first official 1989 winter wheat production estimate will not be ready until May Meanwhile, reports such as the one issued by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> are sifted carefully by trading interests and others for signs of what the future may bring. Some other observations in Wednesday's report included: _ The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cotton harvest was 97 percent complete by Christmas, 14 percentage points ahead of the five-year average for this time of the season _ Peanut harvesting in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was virtually complete _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s soybean harvest was about 96 percent complete _ Tobacco bed preparation continued in the South In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, recent rains brought burley tobacco into `` case,'' and stripping resumed. _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus groves were in `` mostly good'' condition, although lack of rain forced producers to irrigate in most areas The vegetable harvests were under way, mainly tomatoes, peppers, celery and cucumbers. _ In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, harvesting included lettuce, cauliflower, cabbage and carrots In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, rain and cool weather slowed vegetable planting and harvesting. _ Pastures in the South were in `` mostly good to fair'' condition, and livestock was reported mostly in good shape Snow and cold temperatures increased livestock stress in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has continued its corn-buying splurge and has added some soybean meal, making up for some orders it had canceled recently. Officials said Wednesday the new sales included 600,000 metric tons of corn and 600,000 tons of soybean meal. The cancellations earlier in the month had totaled more than 300,000 tons. In a separate announcement, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought an additional 200,000 tons of wheat at subsidized prices, part of 1 million tons authorized for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Dec. 7. Only 10,000 tons remain in that authorization. The latest sales of corn to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> brought the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s total to 9.63 million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 600,000 tons of corn would be about 23.6 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.63 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 62 million. The soybean meal, based on recent <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, prices, could have a processor value of around $ 144 million. Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has proposed to reduce import restrictions on shipments of British swine, pork and pork products. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the proposal is a result of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s eradication of hog cholera, a contagious and sometimes fatal disease of swine. He said no cases of the disease have been reported since August 1987. The restriction currently requires that pork and pork products be cooked, heated or cured and dried before being shipped from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to ensure that disease organisms were destroyed. Under the proposed rule change, small quantities of untreated pork and pork products for personal consumption will be allowed to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. However, commercial shipments must orginate only from plants which meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requirements. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the proposal would affect some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swine producers who have expressed a desire to import swine breeding stock or semen from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. However, he said, these expected shipments `` would not have an impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swine production.''

 The presidential panel charged with the task of recommending which military bases to close was conceived in a 1983 report by a group of private businessmen on how the government could save money. That 1983 group, headed by industrialist <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION>, proposed a non-partisan commission to review the nation's base structure and suggest which should be shut down. The idea was to take <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> out of the picture as much as possible because of the reluctance on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to permit bases to be closed. Shuttered installations mean lost jobs among voters, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has blocked any base closings since 1977. The Grace panel's proposal was received unenthusiastically in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but in 1987, Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, tried to win approval for the commission. His amendment to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill failed by seven votes. <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> was undaunted and spent much of the following winter rounding up support. With <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under pressure to cut federal spending because of rising budget deficits, there were predictions that closing unneeded bases could save as much as $ 5 billion a year. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> signed on to the <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> plan and appointed a commission last summer to begin work. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> delayed final approval until early October, shortly before adjourning for the year. The measure passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed into law by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> created a 12-member commission and a complicated procedure designed by <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> and other supporters of closing bases as a way to circumvent congressional pressure. Once <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has received the panel's recommendations, he will have until Jan. 15 _ five days before he leaves office _ to either accept or reject the entire list. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> can not pick from among the list, which is expected to recommend closing two dozen or more of the nation's largest facilities. If <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> approves the list, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have 45 legislative days, starting March 1, to try to block it. For that to happen, both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have to pass a disapproval resolution, but that could be vetoed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. That means the resolution would need the two-thirds support in each chamber required to override a veto. The base-closing commission has grouped all installations by military mission, such as <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter bases and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ports for surface ships. Then, five factors will be used to define a facility's military value, including: _ How well a base can fulfill its purpose for deployment of troops _ Availability of physical facilities, including runways, storage areas and warehouses _ The physical condition and technical sophistication of those facilities _ Quality of life for personnel and their families at the base _ Community support, including transportation, utilities, related industrial activities and technical help Bases within a certain group, such as <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter bases, were ranked using those five criteria. Lower-ranking bases were considered for closure if higher-ranking facilities could take over their duties. Other factors also were considered, including cost evaluations of the money to be saved by closing a particular base, environmental factors such as disposal of hazardous waste, and the impact on the community of lost jobs.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bass fishing excursion today takes him to a crossroads community that once played host to another vice president _ <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s itinerary calls for about four hours of fishing with prominent <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> sportsman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, whose 55-acre private lake is set in rolling countryside about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. `` We just want to get in some fishing,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who became a friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1978. `` His fishing is so token, he does n't have a chance to get at it much.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportsman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> two decades ago and sold the publishing enterprise for $ 15 million in 1986, is an outspoken conservationist who predicts <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will rival <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> in supporting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s outdoors. `` He feels we've spent enough money on research ... and it's time for action,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in an interview. `` He'll be reasonable but firm'' in protecting the environment. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who got a Thanksgiving Day call from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to arrange the bass fishing outing, has brought attention to a farm community that is composed mainly of a small elementary school, a library, a fire station and <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>'s store and service station at the junction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 31 and Federal Road. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who also has a whitetail deer research program on his land, enjoys talking about the legends of <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>, including visits made by White House figures prior to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said the old Federal Road that crossed through <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION> _ a paved portion of which now runs in front of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s gate _ was the route taken by Gen. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on his way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for the battle of 1812. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and historians also say <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, the vice president who killed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> in a duel, paid an unplanned visit to <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION> in 1807. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> was was captured in southwest <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> on treason charges in Februrary 1807 and was brought up the Federal Road. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> spent one night at <ORGANIZATION> Manac </ORGANIZATION>'s Tavern, which was located at a site about a quarter-mile from <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s property at <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>. `` Pintlala is a Creek Indian word that means ` fish swamp.' It once was a heavy <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> settlement,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` Manac's Tavern was owned by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Manac </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> with large landholdings ... Manac's son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, was the first Indian ever to graduate from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. The news media descended on <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>'s store and service station in anticipation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit. `` It's been a three-ring circus around here,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> as she prepared hot dogs for the lunch crowd Wednesday. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents had checked out `` every squirrel nest and deer stand'' on his property. The only overt indication that the president-elect was on his way was a sign outside the <ORGANIZATION> Pintlala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. It read: `` Welcome President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Godspeed and Good Fishing.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who remains as a figurehead of the B.A.S.S. operation, plays host at its fishing tournaments, some of which are carried on cable television. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> about 10 years ago and was asked to manage <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 campaign in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. `` I'm not sure his pickin' was too good, otherwise he would n't have picked me,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, recalling their loss to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the state's primary. `` But I'm a good salesman.

<HEAD>Trout Farmer Vows To Continue Fight For Grass-Eating Carp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EGREMONT, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A trout farmer who lost his fish-breeding license for importing grass-eating carp has vowed to continue his fight to bring the white amur into the state because of its unique way of weeding ponds. State wildlife officials said they dropped criminal charges against <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Candee </PERSON> because they failed to advise the breeder of his constitutional rights. But the 75-year-old <PERSON> Candee </PERSON> is unrepentant. `` God made these fish and if he made them to eat weeds, why should we use chemicals to pollute our water systems?'' he said. The chairman of the state Division of <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> said the agency has banned the fish and all other non-native wildlife because their long-term effects on the environment are unknown. `` Mr. <PERSON> Candee </PERSON> certainly is n't a marine biologist, nor is his lawyer,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darey </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Until we're 100 percent sure that they wo n't have any negative effects on the environment, we will not turn these fish loose.'' <PERSON> Candee </PERSON> said he imported the fish from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and kept them in a cement pond behind his house. The fish are native to the <LOCATION> Amur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which flows along the boarder of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darey </PERSON> said he is awaiting the findings of a four-year study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> should continue its ban against the fish.

By a proclamation, the president extended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` sovereignty and jurisdiction'' from the present three miles to 12 miles. <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a foreign affairs officer in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and Policy, said the extension makes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the 105th country to claim a 12-mile limit. The 12-mile limit was called for in 1982 by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> on the Law of the Sea, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action leaves only six countries claiming narrower bands of offshore water. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> claim four miles each, and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> each claim six miles, Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` It will make foreign intelligence-gathering more difficult and less effective because foreign ships will no longer be able to station themselves off our shores within the 12-mile limit,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officer said. The proclamation assures foreign ships the right of `` innocent passage'' through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territorial waters and the right to pass through straits. Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said it would not affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and state laws that govern offshore mineral and fishing rights. It applies to the waters off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the Northern Mariana islands and any other territory over which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exercises sovereignty. It applies to airspace over the ocean, as well as the waters and the bed and subsoil of the ocean. In another action, the president extended for six months the state of emergency that he proclaimed in 1986 between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The step was needed to continue in effect the president's 1986 order blocking Libyan assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in retaliation for alleged terrorist action. The president also signed a seven-page executive order implementing the 1,100-page trade act passed by the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> Leslye </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON> said the order will enable the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to continue effectively to work for more open world markets and strengthened international institutions.'' Ms. <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON> said the president's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, telephoned him at the Bel Air home to inform him of the announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> that last week's crash of Pan American Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> was caused by a bomb. `` The investigation will continue to determine how the explosives were introduced into the plane,'' she said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> are working closely with the British and Scottish authorities on the investigation. We are determined to find out who did it, using all available resources.''

<HEAD>Pan Am Investigators May Need Lucky Break To Catch Bombers</HEAD>

 Judging by previous crashes in which bombing was suspected, authorities investigating the Pan American Flight 103 disaster may need a lucky break in the case to apprehend those who carried out the sabotage. British authorities said Wednesday that from examining wreckage they had gathered `` conclusive evidence'' that a bomb blew up the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jumbo jet over southern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last week. Spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had joined forces in `` a criminal inquiry of international dimensions.'' The challenge of finding those responsible is illustrated by looking at two crashes widely blamed on bombing: the Nov. 29, 1987, crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 off the coast of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and the plunge of an <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> 747 into the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on June 22, 1985. The Korean Air crash killed 115 people, while the <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> tragedy claimed 329 lives. In the incident involving Korean Air Flight 858, suspicion quickly focused on two passengers, a man and a woman, who were detained for questioning about forged Japanese passports in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> as they were about to board a plane for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. They had left the doomed Korean aircraft, bound from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, at an intermediary stop in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>. The pair, who turned out to be <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agents, both bit into cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters. The man, identified as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, 70, succeeded in his suicide attempt, but the woman, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON>, 25, survived and was extradited to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. After questioning by South Korean authorities, Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told a nationally televised news conference on Jan. 15, 1988, that she had been involved in bombing the Korean Air jet. She said the episode was intended to disrupt preparations for the 1988 <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics and create unrest in the South. `` I came out here hoping such violent, meaningless incidents would never happen again in the future and I would like to apologize to family members of the dead and the people here by disclosing the truth,'' she said in admitting her role in the incident. South Korean intelligence officers said Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was acting on the personal orders of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, son and political heir of top <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> officially denied involvement with the crash. By contrast, in the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> Flight 182, lengthy investigations by Indian, Canadian, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> authorities have failed to conclusively pinpoint blame for the tragedy. Soon after the crash, unidentified callers to news media said the crash was the work of extremists associated with Sikh separatist organizations. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> groups, however, denied any role and accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of trying to foment anti-Sikh sentiment. According to Indian officials, tapes from the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, recovered from 6,700 feet below the surface of the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, neither proved nor disproved the possibility that sabotage was involved. One official, S.N. <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, told reporters the cockpit conversation was normal until it came to a `` sudden and abrupt end.'' A report by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, disclosed in January 1986, said there was `` considerable circumstantial and other evidence that an explosive device'' detonated in the front cargo compartment of the plane, which was headed from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The report linked the explosion to a suitcase checked onto the flight by a man using the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> who did not board the plane. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, meaning lion, is a name used by all male Sikhs. A book published in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in May 1987 pointed to the lack of arrests in the Air-India case. `` Among the bereaved families, the call for justice is louder, the bitterness and cynicism sharper than at any time since the crash,'' said the book, `` The Sorrow and the Terror.'' The book by award-winning Canadian writers <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaise </PERSON> and his India-born wife, <PERSON> Bharati </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukherjee </PERSON>, claimed that four members of a Sikh terrorist cell in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, were suspected by police. It also claimed that the principals in the case celebrated with pizza at a Sikh temple in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Malton </LOCATION> at about the time the <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> jet plunged into the sea. The problem is to have a case solid enough to prove in court, the authors said. `` To lose the case on any kind of technicality would be a political nightmare,'' according to the book.

<HEAD>Administration Identifies Public Buildings That Could Shelter
Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although they may not be available this winter, 44 `` underutilized'' government buildings and 50 land sites have been designated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as suitable for sheltering the nation's homeless. Meeting a court-appointed deadline, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday ruled that 94 of the 220 pieces of property it reviewed in the past two weeks are suitable for assisting homeless people. However, only 33 of the buildings were determined to be suitable for overnight occupancy or for daytime activities. Another 11 were called suitable only for non-occupancy programs such as warehousing food and clothing. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON>, deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary for housing, said the unused or underutilized land parcels could be used as sites for erecting mobile homes or modular units as temporary shelters. It is problematic whether any of the facilities might be made available for the homeless before this winter is over. `` This is a multi-stage process and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is sort of in the middle of it,'' <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON> said. `` But this could be a relatively quick process from this point on.'' Some of the properties could be made available in less than 45 days, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials said, assuming they meet local health and building codes. City and state officials or private, non-profit organizations wanting to use the buildings or land have 30 days to submit applications. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which own the properties, then have a maximum of 15 days to review the applications. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was under a Dec. 28 deadline imposed two weeks ago by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> here to review at least half of 350 properties listed by <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> and HHS as being excess or surplus. He gave <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> until Jan. 12 to survey the rest of the listed properties, which includes some 1,000 buildings. The government defines excess property as buildings or land under the authority of a particular agency that does n't have any use for it. Surplus property is that for which no government agency has any use. Because <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had only two weeks under <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>'s order to come up with a list, <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON> said the determinations of suitability were made solely on the basis of questionnaires filled out by <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> and HHS. `` We originally intended to have <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> field office staff inspect all properties which appeared to be suitable,'' he said. `` However, the short amount of time allowed ... required that we omit the on-site property inspection.'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> imposed the deadlines in response to a suit filed last September by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless accusing the administration of failing to implement a law passed in July 1987 to make `` underutilized'' federal property available for use as emergency shelters. <PERSON> Maris </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, an attorney for the coalition, called President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support of the program encouraging but said it is `` shameful that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration forced a protracted court battle before obeying a congressional mandate.'' Of the 126 facilities found unsuitable because they lack sound floors, foundations, roofs, walls, electric power or sanitary or water facilities, 53 are buildings and 73 are land sites. The locations of unused or underutilized federally owned buildings listed as suitable for overnight shelters were listed as: <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, Point Arena, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Waycross </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and Shoshone, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Boothville </LOCATION>, La.; <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, Md.; <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Remer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss.; <LOCATION> Tonopah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenixville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Aquadilla </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Maryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Carrizo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rockwall </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> and Warden, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has picked No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> as his deputy national security adviser and is nominating career intelligence analyst <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> at the spy agency. Gates `` knows the system, the critical importance of the interagency process for presidential decision-making and the details of the management of that process,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while he was hunting in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Gates gained national attention in the spring of 1987, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominated him to succeed the late <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> as director of central intelligence. Furor over the Iran-Contra affair delayed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of the nomination, and <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> asked that his name be withdrawn in March 1987. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> has denied consistently that he tried to cover up the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> role in the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms deal, and he has kept a high reputation among intelligence experts on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, R-Me., said Wednesday that <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> `` brings a tremendous reservoir of talent'' to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, in a statement issued through a spokeswoman, called <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> `` an outstanding choice. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> is a loss for the intelligence agency and a gain for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> would serve as deputy to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s designated national security adviser, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. Now, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is national security adviser and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> is his deputy. Gates' appointment is not subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation; that of <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> as deputy to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> is subject to hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence panel and a two-thirds vote of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Had Gates been confirmed as director of central intelligence, he would have been the first <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst to have attained that post. Previous <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> directors either have served in the spy agency's clandestine service or have come from outside, like <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief in 1976 <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> has spent his career as a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst and administrator. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the appointment of <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> `` is tribute to him and a vote of confidence for the agency. While we will miss him here, his appointment is a real plus for the national security of this country.'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> is `` a highly qualified <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> career officer ...,'' said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. `` As deputy director for intelligence, heading up the analytical side of the agency, <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> is my principal adviser on the production of finished intelligence, and is widely respected throughout the intelligence community.'' The Kerr selection also won praise on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>'s appointment sends a message that the new administration is recognizing professional excellence in selecting top officials in the intelligence area,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 45, has served with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> for 22 years, including a five-year loan from 1974-79 to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff. He was raised in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, where he earned straight A's in high school and was an Eagle Scout. He received a bachelor's degree from <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1965, a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 and a doctorate in Russian history from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was deputy director for intelligence for more than four years, and according to one intelligence source greatly improved the quality of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> reports. <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, 53, joined the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> as a military analyst in 1960, concentrating on biographical and reference material relating to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. According to a biography released by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office, <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> also has worked as an imagery analyst, apparently scrutinizing satellite photographs. <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> received a bachelor's degree in history and did some graduate work at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Document Points To Alleged Fraud, Bribery By Air Force Official</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wiretaps on the telephones of a defense consultant and bugging devices in his office have helped investigators paint a picture of alleged contract fraud and bribery involving a top <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> procurement official, according to a government affidavit. The eavesdropping on conversations between <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a deputy to the assistant <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary for acquisitions, and consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> showed that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> `` has used his official position'' to help <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> or his clients in exchange for `` payments and other gratuities,'' the document says. One example outlined in the affidavit involves <ORGANIZATION> Cubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, a client of <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> and maker of shells that house electronic gear, called pods. Sometime before April 1, 1987, when <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>'s phones were tapped, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> to award an unidentified pod contract to Cubic on a sole-source basis so that Cubic would be the only supplier, the document says In a tapped phone conversation May 15, 1987, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> told <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> he would n't award the contract to Cubic as a sole source. But he said he planned to have the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> issue the request for proposal with a required delivery schedule that Cubic's competitor could not meet, the affidavit says. `` <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> that by doing it this way, the procurement would appear to have been completed when, in actuality, Cubic would be guaranteed the award of the contract,'' the document said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> also said he would have the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> exercise an option on a joint Air Force-Navy project being built by Cubic's competitor. This way, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, the competitor would not protest the delivery schedule and he would not have to justify a sole source procurement, the document says. However, <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellborn </PERSON>, president of Cubic, did n't like the plan. <PERSON> Wellborn </PERSON> told <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> in a phone conversation May 21, 1987, there was adequate justification for giving Cubic the contract as a sole source and `` he saw no reason to do a ` crooked' competition,'' the affidavit said. The document says that later that day <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Wellborn </PERSON> that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> had changed his mind and the contract would be given to Cubic as a sole source. The $ 9.8 million contract was awarded to Cubic in December 1987. The affidavit, which was used to justify a search last June of <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, does not tie a specific payment from Cubic or <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> to <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> for that contract or for other contracts mentioned. However, the document alleged that `` <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s willingness to assist Cubic in obtaining government contracts can be traced to what is believed to be the receipt of a payment from Cubic.'' The section in the affidavit that follows that statement was deleted, as were other parts of the document at the request of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office The affidavit also says that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> appears to have been paid by <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> and two of his other clients _ <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> Division. A receptionist in <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s office said he was `` on leave'' and could not be reached for comment. His home telephone number is unpublished. Cubic and <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> are closed for the holidays and officials could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F.C </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no comment. The Cohen affidavit and portions of two others were released on Tuesday in response to a lawsuit by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. A hearing is scheduled for Friday to determine whether portions of the affidavits that were deleted should also be unsealed. The other two affidavits supported searches of the <LOCATION> Berwyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, house of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Seelmeyer </PERSON>, a self-employed consultant, and the <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, home and office of consultant <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanda </PERSON>. These locations along with <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s home were among 40 locations raided by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents last June, when the case was first revealed. No indictments have been handed down. Prosecutors have said they have evidence that consultants, including some former top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who worked for the nation's largest defense contractors, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials for information that helped them win billions of dollars in government contracts.

 When <PERSON> Nezar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hindawi </PERSON> wanted to blow up an Israeli plane in 1986, he packed his girlfriend's suitcase with three pounds of an odorless explosive called Semtex and sent her to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport to board an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 The bomb, which was pre-set to detonate, passed through an airport X-ray machine, and it was discovered only after an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> security guard questioned the young woman, <PERSON> Anne-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who was unaware she was carrying the explosive device. Terrorism experts say Semtex, which is one of the substances suspected in the bombing last week of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, is a terrorist's dream. So far, it has defied all detection attempts by X-ray machines, dogs trained to sniff bombs and other devices. `` It's a favorite with these groups because it's significantly harder to detect than anything else _ it's more powerful than other plastics,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst in the 1960s and 1970s who now is a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. Like its American cousin, C-4, Semtex is malleable like putty and shows up on an X-ray operator's screen as an indistinct, dense mass. But unlike C-4 and other known plastic bombs, Semtex is odorless. Semtex also has the advantage of being stable, meaning it can not go off unless it is meant to. Terrorism experts, including <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, say Semtex is so reliable it has been used by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terrorists sending letter bombs to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. Technology is being developed to overcome the Semtex threat, and two experimental devices are in use at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> airports. The devices shoot neutrons which can interact chemically with plastic explosives in luggage and indicate the existence of a bomb. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which has a well-developed, state-run arms and munitions industry, makes Semtex at a plant called the Eastern Bohemian Works, <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have asked Czech authorities in the past to stop making Semtex or at least to prevent its export. Recently, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> indicated it might be willing to stop selling Semtex, said <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON>, who has served as a consultant to government security and intelligence agencies and has written seven books on international security and terrorism. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is believed to have supplied Semtex to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, said one <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. In testimony at <PERSON> Hindawi </PERSON>'s 1986 trial, British authorities said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had supplied the bomb for the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> plane. The British government subsequently broke off diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> over the affair, although ties later were restored. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has supplied Semtex in several shiploads of weapons to the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and 1987 and may have given it to other terrorist groups. Semtex also is believed to have been used by a tiny <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> - and Libyan-supported Palestinian group once known as the May 15 organization and which is now known as the <PERSON> Hawari </PERSON> group The group is believed to have been responsible for the April 1986 explosion aboard a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 flying from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Four Americans were killed in the blast, which Greek investigators said probably was caused by a Semtex bomb the size of two or three cigarette packs. The bomb was placed under a seat in row 10. The <PERSON> Hawari </PERSON> group specializes in plastic bombs, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterterrorism experts. One of its operatives, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, is being sought by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for questioning in the 1982 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> which resulted in one death.

<HEAD>Bomb Experts Hope New Machine Will Replace Airport X-Ray Detectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While X-ray machines are severely limited in keeping modern explosives off airliners, researchers say they have developed a device that can detect bombs inside luggage with uncanny regularity. But no airline has ordered one of the devices, and with the exception of two prototype machines used in a yearlong test program in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, no airports have put the machine into operation. The disclosure Wednesday that a bomb detonated aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet last week over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard, is likely to spur interest in the new explosives detection device, industry officials said. The machine goes by the name of Termal Neutron Analysis device, or <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION>, and is about twice the size of an airport X-ray machine. During the yearlong test under a contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> it demonstrated a 95 percent detection rate with few false alarms, the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> recently ordered five more TNAs at a cost of $ 8.4 million. The agency plans to put them into other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports beginning next summer. `` We are now in the production phase. The research and development is over,'' said <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozorgmanesh </PERSON>, a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, the developer of the machine. He said the five machines will be used to routinely monitor baggage checked on regularly scheduled flights. Once the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and airlines are convinced of the reliability of the machines, the agency is likely to require the devices be installed at certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports. But that is expected to be several years away, according to agency sources. <PERSON> Bozorgmanesh </PERSON> said his company also has had inquiries from a number of foreign governments, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` But none of them have put in orders,'' he added. <PERSON> Bozorgmanesh </PERSON> said he is confident the machine can detect a wide variety of explosives, even the plastic type of explosive which is believed to have been smuggled aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in a piece of checked luggage. Security officials use the conventional X-ray machines that are currently at airport screening points to detect metal parts or wiring that might resemble a bomb. But there are many explosives that can be shaped in a variety of innocent-looking forms _ and they are so powerful that a few pounds can rip apart a jetliner. However, the <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> machine does not look for certain sizes or shapes. It relies instead on the fact that all explosives contain large and concentrated amounts of nitrogen. According to <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION>'s developers, the machine bombards a piece of luggage with neutrons, which pass through all types of material _ even sheets of lead _ without a significant reaction. But the nitrogen in explosives absorbs the neutrons and immediately gives off gamma radiation. The gamma radiation gives the luggage a unique signature that can be detected by the machine. The amount of radiation has no significant effect on the suitcase or its contents, <PERSON> Bozorgmanesh </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> _ with a nudge from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ stepped up its development of bomb detection devices after a terrorist bomb apparently caused an <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet to crash off the Irish coast in l985 and a bomb detonated aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in 1986, killing four Americans. While the technology soon became workable in a laboratory environment, adapting it for use at a crowded airport where thousands of pieces of luggage must be scanned in a short period was more of a challenge. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, director of aviation security at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, said initially there were too many false alarms, but those problems appear to have been resolved. `` Our results have been very, very satisfactory,'' he said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the device is capable of scanning a piece of luggage in six seconds and can be adapted for use with a conveyor system that could handle large numbers of baggage in relatively short periods of time with a low rate of false alarms. `` You could do an entire <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in a half hour or so,'' <PERSON> Bozorgmanesh </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the company's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> office. Each machine now costs more than $ 1 million, but eventually the cost is expected to range from about $ 500,000 to $ 900,000, depending on how many are produced, according to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and industry estimates. `` We could produce a lot of them in a short period of time,'' <PERSON> Bozorgmanesh </PERSON> said. But he added, `` The airlines are not lined up right now to purchase these things. We have to demonstrate to them that it works.''

 Final, official vote tallies from the Nov. 8 presidential election show Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defeated Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by slightly more than 7 million votes of the more than 91.5 million cast in the 50 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The president-elect garnered 53.37 percent of the vote, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got 45.67 percent. Minor party candidates received less than 1 percent of the votes. A total of 91,585,872 votes were cast for candidates who were listed on the state ballots. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s biggest vote margin came in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where he bested the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor by about 960,000 votes. His biggest percentage margin was in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received 66.2 percent of the total vote, to 32.04 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' biggest vote margin was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which he won by 266,000 votes of more than 6.4 million cast. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the highest vote percentage _ 83.31 percent _ followed by <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where he won 55.65 percent of the vote. Libertarian nominee <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was the leading vote-getter among the non-major party candidates, garnering more than four-tenths of one percent of the votes. That is above the one-quarter of a percent of the 1984 vote won by <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Leonora </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> won more than two-tenths of one percent, good for second place among the independent hopefuls. Most of the third-party candidates were on the ballot in only a handful of states each. Only <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> was on the ballot in all 50 states. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was on the ballot in 47 states. Here are the final national vote returns and the percentage for each candidate.

 A flight carrying 40 passengers was diverted for an unscheduled landing at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> Wednesday after losing cabin pressurization, apparently due to a faulty valve, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 269 from <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> had been airborne for about a half hour when the cabin of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 aircraft depressurized, said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Passengers were told to use oxygen masks, and no-one was injured, he said. The flight was diverted to <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, where it landed without incident at about 5 p.m. and passengers were put on other flights. The plane was to be repaired overnight, <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> said. `` The mechanics are looking at it. At this point it appears the depressurization stemmed from a faulty valve in the pressurization system,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Roseanne' Beats `Cosby'; NBC Might Have All-Win Season</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had its first No. 1 series since 1984 when `` Roseanne'' edged <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' for the top spot in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. The last ABC No. 1 show that was a regularly scheduled series was the Dec. 19, 1984, episode of `` Dynasty.'' Due to expected low holiday week viewing, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> loaded up its schedule with repeats. A first-run `` Roseanne'' beat a repeat of `` Cosby.'' The rest of the top 10 were: `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Monday Night Football,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Night Court,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; and `` In the Heat of the Night,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. CBS' highest-rated shows of the week were `` Designing Women'' at 17th, followed by `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' at 18th. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> racked up its 27th straight weekly victory. If <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> wins the rest of the season, it would be the first time a network has done so since <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> won every week of the 1963-64 season. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> came within a week of that 39-week record last year, but the World Series on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> broke the streak. If <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> does set a record for 1988-89 it will be with an asterisk because the writers' strike delayed <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s and CBS' fall lineups, while <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> began the season with the Summer Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time rating of 13.7 to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 11.7 and CBS' 10.9. The season officially began 14 weeks ago, giving <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> a season-to-date average rating of 16.0 to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13.1 and CBS' 11.9. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS count the season as having begun in late October, at which time they had gotten most of their strike-delayed new shows on the air. Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The network news race is so close, the ratings changed ever so slightly last week and turned the standings around. The `` CBS Evening News'' resumed first place with an average 11.0 rating. `` ABC World News Tonight'' had 10.8, and `` NBC Nightly News'' had 10.6. Due to Christmas Eve and Christmas Day falling on Saturday and Sunday, the only two nights of <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> programming, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> ran all repeats and suffered an expectable drop in ratings. It's lowest-rated show, `` Beyond Tomorrow,'' had a meager 1.9 rating.

<TEXT>
 At a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting this month, Mayor <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> was asked his opinion of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s wartime responsibility _ an especially sensitive question considering the monarch's frail condition The mayor's response, that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> shares the blame for World War II and might have spared this city the atomic bomb, has created a nationwide backlash that includes calls for <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON>'s ouster and huge anti-Motoshima rallies. It cost <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> the support of the governing party and will likely cost him a fourth term in office, and it illustrated the risks of speaking negatively of the 87-year-old emperor. At the meeting, <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> said that judging from historical accounts and his own wartime experience, `` I believe the emperor shares responsibility for the war, as well as all of us who lived in that period.'' Coming on the 47th anniversary of the bombing of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, the comments were seen as especially inappropriate by Japanese, who consider it despicable to criticize a suffering person. More than 100 trucks with loudspeakers paraded through the city center blaring demands that <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> be removed from office. About 1,200 riot police were mobilized, both to guard the mayor and to prevent street violence. Apart from leaders of the anti-emperor <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, few public figures have spoken about <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s wartime role since he became seriously ill three months ago with intestinal bleeding and has been hovering near death since. Soon after <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON>'s comment, which came in response to a question from a Communist municipal assembly member, right-wingers had about 10 sound trucks roaring down <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>'s streets. Rightists from many parts of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> converged on this port city of 450,000. On Dec. 21 and 22, about 100 sound trucks surrounded City Hall for three hours each afternoon. Haranguing speeches and slogans like `` Death to <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON>!'' and `` Kick the traitor out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>!'' blared from loudspeakers, and about 260 radical rightists wearing military-style uniforms were present. A delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the national government and had backed the indepependent <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> since he took office in 1979, demanded the mayor retract the comments. When he refused, the party decided to withdraw its support, making it unlikely <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> could win a fourth term. `` It was an act of extreme indiscretion for a public figure like him to express such a view publicly at this time when the emperor is ill,'' said <PERSON> Shigeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Honda </PERSON>, deputy head of the party in <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> prefecture. <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> has received death threats, and last week a rightist charged into City Hall carrying a can of gasoline. He was arrested before he could do any damage. `` I never felt in such immense danger to my personal safety as well as to my family's in my life,'' the mayor told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` How can I take it back when I said what I believe?'' he asked. `` I feel the withdrawal of my statement would endanger the hard-won freedom of speech in this country.'' His view of the emperor's partial responsibility for the war is believed widely held among Japanese, especially intellectuals. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was a figurehead while real power was held by militarists, but he was able to decide to end the war when the government was evenly divided in August 1945, after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped atomic bombs on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> on that Aug. 9, more than 70,000 people died, about 35 percent of the city's population. In <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, which took the first bomb Aug. 6, the death toll was about 140,000. `` Especially among the people of <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, there is a strong feeling that if the emperor could stop the war on Aug. 15, 1945, why could n't he have done it a week earlier, so the tragedy on Aug. 9 could have been avoided,'' <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. He said the Japanese have been wrong to put such a taboo on discussing the wartime role of the emperor, revered as a Shinto god. `` I said what I believe, but to be honest, I did not expect this would cause such a big fuss,'' he said. `` I guess the real mistake was I waited to say it until now.'' He blamed `` the fear of rightist attacks and the complexity of the matter'' for making most Japanese hesitate to even talk about it. Some <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> citizens have expressed support for the mayor. `` He said what long needed to be said,'' said <PERSON> Shigetoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Iwamatsu </PERSON>, a social studies professor at <ORGANIZATION> Nagasaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, the more serious problem is the rightists' threat to freedom of speech.'' Said <PERSON> Tatsuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Akizuki </PERSON>, a noted peace activist and president of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, `` This incident shows how crippled we are in discussing the emperor properly and objectively. `` The question of the emperor's responsibility in the war was left out of our mind for so long that most of us have forgotten how to deal with it.''

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators are racing the clock to complete a string of bailout packages for insolvent savings and loan institutions before the end of the year when tax breaks for investors will be cut in half. Officials expect that before Sunday as many as 200 failed savings and loans will have been dealt with this year, setting a post-Depression record. By contrast, 48 S & amp; Ls were merged or closed last year. So far the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has handled the cases of 184 failed S & amp; Ls, including two bailouts announced Wednesday that are among the largest. The bank board put together a $ 5.1 billion package to assist in the takeover of five of the most troubled savings and loans in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by an investment group led by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION>, the cosmetics company. Also on Wednesday, the bank board pledged $ 1.7 billion in government assistance in the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the nation's largest insolvent S & amp; L, by a group headed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. The size of the government assistance packages being required to attract new investors points up the depth of the problem facing the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry and the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, analysts said. The trouble is that virtually all of the options President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can select from to deal with the crisis involve spending more federal money, which will in turn worsen his other big economic problem: finding a way to narrow the federal budget deficit without resorting to new taxes. Estimates of the total cost to the government of resolving the S & amp; L mess range as high as $ 112 billion, and losses are mounting by $ 1 billion a month. For this reason, analysts said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not afford to delay seeking a solution. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be committing political suicide if it does n't candidly address this problem immediately after taking office,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial consultant based in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` This is a big, expensive problem and it is getting bigger.'' The bank board worked late into the night Wednesday as the agency raced the clock to finish as many deals as possible before Jan. 1 when certain tax writeoffs will expire. The provisions that will expire had allowed firms purchasing failed S & amp; Ls to deduct the previous losses of those associations from profits the firms earned on other operations. The loss of that provision will effectively cut the tax benefit to purchasers in half. In virtually all transactions completed in 1988, the firms taking over the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will qualify for tax breaks that will exceed what they are paying for the institutions. Critics have charged that even though the size of the lost tax revenues will be enormous, the bank board is not taking this revenue drain into account in figuring the total cost to the government of the bailout packages. In a recent letter to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he was concerned about the tax benefits being handed out and he said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would likely look into that in the new year. Even with the post-Depression record number of insolvent S & amp; Ls being handled this year, more than 400 insolvent institutions remain open, and hundreds more are close to insolvency. So far the government assistance has come primarily from the insurance fees the healthy <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls pay to the federal agency which insures individual deposits up to $ 100,000. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is an arm of the bank board, is itself technically insolvent, with its obligations to merge or close sick <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls far outweighing the revenue stream expected from industry fees. It is this gap which critics say the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to find a way of closing. Even now, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is grappling with the problem of finding additional money for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in its final budget, which must be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9. All of the S & amp; Ls being taken over this week have been insolvent for several years but have been kept open because the insurance fund did not have enough cash to pay off depositors or shut them down. Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have criticized the bank board's rescue packages for failing to attract enough money from the investors taking over the failed S & amp; Ls. But <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said Wednesday that the cost to the government of simply closing the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors to the maximum of $ 100,000 would be far more costly. In addition to the American Savings rescue plan and the takeover of five of the most troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions, the bank board on Wednesday also approved takeovers of: _ <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> Barnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> NVRyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, a home construction company _ <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Debate Over Growth Hormones in Meat Pits Profits Against Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European officials agree that the scientific debate over hormone-treated meat is just one aspect in their cross-Atlantic trade dispute, it nonetheless has focused concern on whether health safety is being sacrificed for profits. European consumers and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health advocacy groups say eating hormone-treated meat may be hazardous to your health. But many American scientists and government officials disagree. The debate has been spotlighted by a ban that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> plans to implement Jan. 1 against hormone-treated beef and veal from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and all other foreign suppliers. The ban, which will cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat producers some $ 100 million in export sales to the 12-nation EEC, has sparked a warning of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation against some European food products that could deteriorate into a full-scale trade war. Producers of beef and veal treat their cattle with hormones in order to make them grow faster, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory officials say the quantities are minuscule compared with the amounts of the same hormones produced naturally by the human body. The maximum dose allowed by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for cattle equals one-tenth of the amount of the hormone found in pre-pubescent children, who have the lowest hormone level in humans. `` It's totally inconsequential,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Teske </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approves only three kinds of hormone treatment: estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. It banned diethyl stilbestrol, or DES, 10 years ago after it was proven to be cancer-causing. Use of DES by European cattle growers resulted in a scare for Italian consumers in 1980, when hundreds of children showed signs of early sexual development such as breast growth. Similar reports of pre-pubescent development among some 3,000 Puerto Rican children in the early 1980s were never traced back to hormone use in animals, <PERSON> Tiske </PERSON> said. Residues of DES also were discovered in residents of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, prompting a consumer movement that led to European-wide legislation against hormone-treated meat. But unlike European breeders, who in the past injected hormones into the skeletal parts of the cattle, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cattle raisers are only allowed to administer the hormones to the non-edible parts of the animals. Under <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations, the hormone pellets are shot into the animals' ears, from where they release the substance slowly into the blood stream. Thus, humans do not ingest meat with a high concentration of hormones. Some abuses of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> standards have been reported, such as meat producers who inject the pellet into the edible portion of the cattle to make the hormones spread faster, <PERSON> Teske </PERSON> said. But such cases are rare, and there are no known black-market exports to European consumers, he added. Ironically, there have been many more reported cases of black-market meat sales in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is investigating reports of hormone treatment of animals in defiance of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ban. But some American consumers, despite assurances from the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, have decided to take their case directly to the retailers. `` The question is whether consumers should be forced to wait until the scientific dust settles, or whether it's better to be safe than sorry,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> of the Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer advocacy group concerned with nutrition and health issues. The center has been spearheading a grassroots campaign to encourage consumers to demand hormone-free meat. Several businesses already produce it. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said that despite the lack of conclusive scientific evidence of a direct link between cancer and hormone-treated meat, the government has been derelict in failing to pursue more research. He attributed the reluctance partly to a decline in government regulation under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and partly to pressure from the cattle industry.

The fourth victim, also found on the ground, was killed instantly when the bomb exploded under his seat. Authorities speculated the terrorist who set the charge may have been confused by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s recent shift to daylight-saving time. Had the bomb gone off an hour earlier _ before the jet began its descent _ the massive decompression of the fuselage would have caused a crash killing all 122 people aboard.

<HEAD>GAO Study Says Criteria For Veterans' Disability Benefits Are
Outdated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many disabled veterans may be missing out on hundreds of dollars' worth of benefits from the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> because the payments are calculated with outdated medical standards, according to a congressional study. The VA, responding to the report Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said it has agreed to make the first comprehensive overhaul of the medical standards since 1945. The standards have been updated on a piecemeal basis over the past few decades, the report said, but they still fail to take into account many medical advances. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said many veterans may be over - or under-compensated for injuries that occurred both during military duty and afterward `` VA can not ensure that veterans are given accurate and uniform disability ratings because the rating schedule has not been adjusted to incorporate the results of many recent medical advances,'' the study said. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> paid about $ 14.3 billion in disability benefits to about 3.8 million veterans and their survivors in 1987, said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative branch of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is inherently difficult to achieve uniform and accurate administration of this type of program; out-of-date rating schedules make it almost impossible,'' according to the report. Some medical conditions are not listed in the schedule, which means a VA rating specialist must use his or her own judgment to classify the disability, the report said. Veterans Administrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, responding to the study, said he would prepare a plan for a `` methodical review'' of the rating schedule, and added that he agreed with a recommendation that the schedule be reviewed regularly from now on. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed with the report's findings A 1983 internal study by the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> used 13 sample cases representing 23 separate disabilities for which veterans already had been awarded compensation benefits. Those cases were sent to 56 of the 58 <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> regional offices to be classified. In one case, a veteran with hypertensive heart disease was assigned five different ratings, ranging from 10 percent disability to 100 percent. Twenty-five rating boards gave him a 30 percent disability, or $ 202 per month in benefits, and 21 boards gave him 60 percent, or $ 516 in benefits. In another case, a veteran with post traumatic stress disorder was rated from zero to 70 percent disabled by the various boards, which would have meant anywhere from no benefits to $ 410 a month, the report said. In a <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> survey of 383 VA rating specialists, 61 percent said it was `` somewhat likely'' or `` very likely'' that in rating mental disorders, they could reach two or more rating percentages with the same medical evidence. Fifty-one percent said the same situation could occur in rating neurological and convulsive disorders, and for all types of illness, 22 percent said it was likely to reach more than one conclusion with the same medical evidence.

<HEAD>Suit Accuses Du Pont Of Putting Too Much Lead in Gasoline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government filed a $ 8.23 million suit against E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the chemicals giant of helping produce gasoline containing too much lead at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> refinery from 1983 through 1985. The company, a major supplier of lead compounds, said the suit was `` without merit'' because it was not subject to the regulations it is accused of violating. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said a complaint, filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, charged that a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> and three other companies put 2 billion grams too much lead _ 2,200 tons _ in gasoline blended at <LOCATION> Carteret </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The government seeks the maximum fine of $ 10,000 a day for each of the 823 days specified in the complaint. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 filed an administrative complaint against <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> but was unable to reach a settlement with the company. In <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> read a statement from <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCleskey </PERSON>, planning director of the company's chemicals and pigments department, charging that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s action was `` without merit.'' `` The allegations are false. We will contest the novel and strained interpretation of the regulations. We complied fully with all regulations applicable to lead suppliers,'' and can not be held responsible for alleged violations by others, <PERSON> McCleskey </PERSON> said. Later, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> himself said it was `` simply not a fact'' that the operation was a `` joint venture'' as <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said it was only a supplier. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> contended that <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> decided how much lead was to be used, injected the compound at the blending plant, determined that the final product was suitable for sale as leaded gasoline and advised the other participants in the venture about <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. The activities in effect made <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> a refiner, subject to the refining regulations and just as responsible for the excess lead as any of the other parties, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency filed administrative complaints against the other three companies, two of which are now inactive. The third, <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tarricone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> petroleum marketer, is operating under protection of the bankruptcy courts and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it had filed a claim against that company in the bankruptcy case. Lead is the cheapest way to increase gasoline octane, but high concentrations in auto emissions can cause neurological damage to children and may contribute to high blood pressure in adults. It also damages pollution control equipment in cars not designed for leaded gasoline. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been ordering lower concentrations of lead in leaded gasoline for years. The 1982 limit of 1.1 gram per gallon was reduced to 0.5 gram on July 1, 1985 and 0.1 gram on Jan. 1, 1986. The 2 billion grams of excessive lead added by the <LOCATION> Carteret </LOCATION> plant would amount to about 2 percent of all lead used in fuels in 1983-1985, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates.

<HEAD>Report Says Top Aides Refused Mayor's Plan To Blame Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> wanted to blame city police for unfairly raising suspicions about him in connection with the aborted drug investigation of an acquaintance, but his senior aides refused to go along with the plan, according to a published report. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> met with his aides Wednesday in an attempt to draft a formal response to accusations that he consorted with a man police identified as a drug suspect. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had planned to suggest that his visits to a downtown hotel to meet former city employee <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> involved no wrongdoing, and that poor police work had unfairly raised suspicions about him. However, three of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s aides refused to endorse the plan, the newspaper reported, citing sources it did not identify. In advance of an expected statement by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> today on the incident, one official and a city council called on him to explain publicly his relationship with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. City Councilman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is suffering `` a credibility problem'' with various council members and other city officials. `` My reaction is, it's too bad we're here again,'' said <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>, referring to allegations of drug involvement that have dogged <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> for several years. `` My only suggestion is that the mayor make a public statement about what's happening with him, just lay it on the line.'' Police investigators have turned over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office the results of an internal probe into why two detectives were stopped from attempting an undercover drug buy from <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> last Thursday, after <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> turned up at <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has since acknowledged making several calls upon <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, whom he described as an acquaintance, but denied any involvement with drugs. The current probe was expected to determine whether <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was involved in any drug activity, why the mayor was in the hotel, and why the police officers did not search <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room until after he had checked out Friday morning. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office would not comment on the report.

<HEAD>Second Recall Issued for Wooden Enclosures After Child's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government, spurred by the death of a 17-month-old boy in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, has issued a second recall for wooden, accordion-style enclosures used as playpens for small children. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Nu-Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of Suring, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, is offering a $ 10 cash refund or $ 15 coupon for anyone who returns a wooden enclosure, whether it was manufactured by Nu-Line or another company. The agency said children between 10 months and 2 years of age are at the greatest risk because their heads can become stuck in the diamond-shaped openings in the middle of the enclosure or the V-shaped openings at the top. People may reach Nu-Line by calling a toll-free number, 1-800-558-7300.

 Some relatives of the 259 people killed on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 were preparing funerals when authorities confirmed a bomb blew up the jetliner. The news, although expected, elicited bewilderment, anger and calls for vengeance. The first five bodies of Americans killed in the Dec. 21 crash arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the day British investigators confirmed that a bomb had been planted on the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> flight, which had stopped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Investigators were trying to determine who planted the bomb. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Colasanti </PERSON>, father of 20-year-old <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Colasanti </PERSON>, got the news while preparing for his son's funeral. `` If it were an act of God it would be easier for us to accept,'' said <PERSON> Colasanti </PERSON>, of Melrose, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The fact that it was a terrorist act makes it much more difficult to accept <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s loss.'' `` At this point, we're just trying to cope with the loss of our son,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, mother of victim <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, 24. `` That sort of thing is more than we can deal with.'' After the crash, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials acknowledged that its diplomats had been warned of a threat to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> airliner on the <LOCATION> Frankfurt-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> route in December. `` I feel that every passenger on that plane should have been given the same warning as diplomats,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, whose 20-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Theodora </PERSON>, was among 35 students returning home from a <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> overseas program. `` They know how to differentiate between safe and real threats. `` In those cases where it's serious, security should be heavy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` Every piece of luggage should be inspected by hand. Why did n't they? I'll tell you why. Money. `` We can not allow greed to endanger the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. My baby will never come back. I will fight with every breath to see this never happens to another mother,'' she said. <PERSON> Gheorghina </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuclu </PERSON>, whose 21-year-old son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, was killed while heading home for the holidays from his studies in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, said she was n't surprised by the finding that a bomb caused the crash. `` I hope the government does something with this mess and finds out who did this,'' the Alliance, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, woman said. `` I am so sorry for this. Everybody loved <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>. God help anybody who suffers like I do.'' The family of 20-year-old <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, said the confirmation of a bomb was disheartening. `` Although we suspected a bomb from the beginning, the reality is overwhelming the loss of our <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> by such a senseless act magnifies the problems that exist in our world today,'' a family statement said. `` We pray that peace and sanity will soon take over as the dominant words in our civilization.'' <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Faulkville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, whose son <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> was on the flight, said the news `` did n't surprise me one bit.'' <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said whatever country or party is determined to be responsible for the bombing `` should be wiped out.'' `` I hate to be hard-nosed about it, but that's the way I feel,'' he said. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, whose nephew, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was aboard, said she was angry but does n't want revenge. `` I do n't believe in retaliation,'' she said. `` I think it would make more trouble.''

 In their efforts to identify the bombers, investigators sought today to determine the type of plastic explosive that downed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and where and how it was planted. On Wednesday, British authorities ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to toughen their security for checked baggage in light of the Dec. 21 attack, which claimed the lives of 259 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and at least 11 local villagers. `` At this point, we do n't have one particular lead or theory that we think is more promising than others,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We are simply pursuing all the leads that we have.'' The investigation is known to involve Scottish police, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's anti-terrorist branch and federal police in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The New York-bound flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. The Israeli daily newspaper The Nation has quoted West German intelligence sources as saying they believe a suspect from the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, led by a rival of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> named <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, boarded the plane in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The suspect carried `` a briefcase packed with Syrian-supplied explosives that can not be detected by routine security methods,'' The Nation said. The guerrilla left Flight 103 while it was in transit in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, leaving the briefcase behind, the paper reported Friday without elaborating. The Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> became the first terrorist organization to bomb an airliner in flight when it blew up a Tel Aviv-bound Swiss airliner in 1970, according to <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON>, director of research at the private Institute for the Study of Terrorism in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Forty-seven people were killed. He said the group may have felt itself isolated from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process because <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounced terrorism, leading <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> this month. <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON>, however, said he considered <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> `` the top suspect because he's the most capable of undertaking a mission of this type.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Palestinian faction opposed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Libya-allied guerrilla group has been blamed for dozens of hijackings, bombings and assassinations since it broke with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1976. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group said from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that it was `` painfully saddened'' by the crash. But <PERSON> Yonah </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrorism </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> does not always take responsibility for attacks for which his group has been blamed, including a 1986 synagogue attack in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> that killed 22 people and the commandeering of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet the day before in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that left 20 people dead. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group is believed to have easy access to Semtex, a Czechoslovak-made plastic explosive that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> possess. It is lightweight, odorless and the only substance known to have defied all detection attempts by bomb-sniffing dogs, X-ray machines and other devices. In announcing their finding that a bomb downed Flight 103, British authorities said Wednesday that the residue of explosives recovered from the debris was `` consistent with the use of a high performance plastic explosive'' like Semtex. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the chief investigator, said examinations of a metal luggage pallet found `` conclusive evidence of a detonating high explosive.'' `` Much investigative work remains to be done to establish the nature of the explosive device, what it was contained in, its location in the aircraft and the sequence of events immediately following its detonation,'' he said. The jet broke apart six miles in the air and rained wreckage and bodies on <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and the surrounding countryside. One wing has still not been located. So far, 241 bodies have been found; nine identified and released to next-of-kin. Police spokesman <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said there would be no easing of the search effort, which involved about 600 people daily. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-terrorism office, said three groups have claimed responsibility for the attack: the Guardians of Islamic Revolution, the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, and a group of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists whose name he did not have. The investigation will concentrate principally on two airports: in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, where the jumbo jet took over the flight. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilshire </PERSON>, an aviation expert and Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the passengers on Flight 103 included a dozen who transferred from other flights feeding into <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. The luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> security system, but luggage belonging to the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> passengers did not, he said. On Wednesday night, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that, following consultations with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, it was `` immediately directing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to take additional measures in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, in particular in relation to hold baggage.''

 Fire erupted on the ninth floor of a 13-story building housing news and entertainment organizations Wednesday night, briefly trapping an undetermined number of people above the flames, authorities said. More than 80 firefighters battled the blaze, which broke out shortly before 9:30 p.m. and was put out within an hour, said Firefighter <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. Office and maintenance workers trapped by the flames at the Cahuenga Sunset Building on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> fled to the roof while firefighters entered the building and hosed down the fire. No injuries were reported. After the blaze was doused, firefighters rappelled to the roof from a hovering helicopter and escorted people down the stairs from the upper floors. `` Everything's out and everything's OK,'' said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` That's the bottom line. The cause of the fire, which was contained to the ninth floor, was being investigated.

Perhaps No. 1 on the list of suspects is <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, followed by a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> faction headed by a rival to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, terrorists opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and even <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> hitmen for hire, terrorism experts say. `` <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> is the top suspect because he's the most capable of undertaking a mission of this type,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON>, director of research at the private Institute for the Study of Terrorism in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Palestinian guerrilla group opposed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The group, allied with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, has been blamed for hijackings, bombings and assassinations since it broke with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1976. `` Such an act of terrorism by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> would be a message to the world that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> can not bring peace to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. ... It's a message to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a slap in the face for <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group said from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that it was `` painfully saddened'' by the Dec. 21 crash of Flight 103, which originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yonah </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrorism </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> does not always take responsibility for attacks his group has been blamed for, including the 1986 attack on a synagogue that killed 22 people in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s guerrillas also were held responsible for commandeering a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet the day before in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. About 20 people were killed. One alleged member of the group, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, is wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1982 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner flying from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. One person was killed and 15 injured in the attack. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, 39, is serving a seven-month sentence for entering <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with a false passport. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month indefinitely postponed a decision to extradite him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> also speculated that pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem terrorists may have planted the bomb. On Dec. 22, an anonymous caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> claimed a pro-Iranian group called Guardians of the Islamic Revolution was responsible. The caller said the motive was revenge for the July downing of Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said was a case of mistaken identity. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the group was probably was not involved. <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said the group has claimed responsibility for just one incident: an attack on a leading Iranian dissident in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in September 1987. Last week, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of counterterrorism, said callers claimed two other groups were responsible He said they were Islamic Jihad, another pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group; and a group of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> whose name he did not have. <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said other Palestinian suspects include the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, and the May 15th Organization led by <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Amri </PERSON>. The Popular Front was the first terrorist organization to bomb an airliner in flight when it attacked a Swiss airliner in 1970, he said. Forty-seven people were killed. <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said the group is closely associated with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, whose president, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, may `` feel that he has been marginalized from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process.'' <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merari </PERSON>, a senior researcher in terrorism at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s group often uses tourists and other unsuspecting carriers to plant its bombs He said a sophisticated bomb was found concealed in a radio when 13 members of the group were detained in October in raids in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said the May 15th Organization was responsible for the attack on a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in April 1986 that killed four peole and injured nine. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said European terrorists, including the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, may have staged the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> attack to press their demands to pull <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Other possibile culprits include <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> assassins `` recruited by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to perpetrate this kind of crime,'' he said. `` They use these soldiers of fortune, terrorists for hire, to erase any footsteps.''

 A 250-foot cargo ship with 11 people sank in rough seas off the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> coast late Wednesday, leaving at least one person missing after he slipped through his life jacket during a rescue, authorities said. A merchant ship rescued two other crew members, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said early Thursday. After searching the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> for two hours, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet spotted a life raft with an unknown number of survivors. A helicopter was dispatched to assist, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbogast </PERSON>. `` There were people on the raft waving flashlights, but we do n't know how many,'' he said The crew of the <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bermuda </ORGANIZATION> abandoned ship in two rafts about 7 p.m. when the ship's load shifted, causing the vessel to sink about 160 miles south of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> and 200 miles off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumble </PERSON>. Searchers were hampered by 40 - to 45-mph winds and 20 - to 25-foot Despite the heavy seas and poor visibility, <PERSON> Arbogast </PERSON> said the crew's chances of survival were good. A merchant vessel, the Eagle, which was nearest to the <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON> when the ship went down, was guided to one of the rafts by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. Two <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON> crew members were pulled aboard the Eagle, said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who earlier reported that at least three were saved. `` The Eagle recovered two and in the process of trying to get the third guy on board, he slipped through the life jacket and back into the water and they ca n't see him now,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said early Thursday. He said did n't know about the others. Two helicopters, a jet from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> air station on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> and a C-130 aircraft from <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, arrived in the vicinity about 10:20 p.m. and immediately began the search. But the helicopters ran low on fuel after about 90 minutes and returned to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trumble </PERSON> said. When the life raft was sighted about 12:15 a.m., another helicopter was sent out, <PERSON> Arbogast </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON>, registered in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, is a container ship that makes a regular weekly passage from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arbogast </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Models Angered by Nude Art Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Controversy over <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s first exhibition of nude paintings has taken a new turn with models theatening to sue an art institute for exposing them to the public eye. Reporters for the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that two of the six nude models of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> will file suit because the institute did not obtain their permission to allow a publishing house to print postcards and a book of paintings sold at the exhibition. The 18-day exhibition at the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery opened Dec. 22 and has drawn crowds of 10,000 a day, many of them young men willing to pay 10 times the usual admission price for their first look at officially sanctioned nude art. The reporters said the models also stayed off the job Monday, a claim denied by an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Chinese sources also said that the husband of one of the models was seeking a divorce after learning his wife had been posing in the nude without his knowledge. Another woman is also facing marital difficulties because of the show, they said. The painting of nudes has traditionally had a very minor role in Chinese art history, and the use of nude models was banned for a long time under Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s puritanical commissars of art. Modeling in the nude was revived in 1984, but women models have often been subject to social ostracism. The official press earlier this year carried stories of a female model at the <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> who went insane after neighbors accused her of being a prostitute. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that one model for the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> exhibition was so terrified her husband would find out about her secret job that she kept him away from home so he would n't see the opening day of the event on the television news. Models at the <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> are paid about five times what an average Chinese worker earns per hour. The show, 128 paintings by 21 artists, has drawn high praise from people who say it is a breakthrough in Chinese society's ability to differentiate art from pornography. It has also been criticized by others who say the paintings appeal to the prurient interests of young Chinese and are out of step with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> artistic and social values.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges On Inflation Concern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar surged against the Japanese yen today as life insurance companies bought dollars actively ahead of the New Year, pushing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency up for the third consecutive day, dealers said. The dollar closed at 126.03 yen, up 0.76 yen from Wednesday's close and up 4.03 yen from its 1987 year-end closing It opened today at 125.42 yen. `` Life insurance companies are on stage,'' said <PERSON> Kaneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON>, a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He said other traders, reluctant to make large moves ahead of the New Year, largely reacted to active buying and selling by the life insurance firms. The dollar began the day on a strong note following overseas gains due partly to intervention Wednesday in the market by the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, dealers said. The dollar `` strengthened after the market interpreted Wednesday's intervention by the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> as a signal of concern over inflation,'' said one dealer, speaking anonymously. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank, reportedly sold about $ 100 million in support of the West German mark on Wednesday, he added. Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain around the current level for the remainder of the year due to current sentiment toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. It has gained 1.31 yen in the last three days. `` I think it could go higher,'' <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> said. The foreign exchange market in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> will end 1988 trading with a full day of business Friday and will resume trading on Jan. 4.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers using British airports were ordered by the government to tighten security just hours after it announced that a bomb had downed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The directive Wednesday said especially close attention should be paid to the handling of baggage stored in aircraft cargo bays. It was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> after consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which the British agency said was `` also considering further security requirements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines worldwide.'' The decision on the same day investigators announced that a bomb caused the Dec. 21 crash of Flight 103, killing all 259 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and at least 11 on the ground. Officials said evidence of the explosion, believed to have been caused by hard-to-detect plastic explosives, was found in wreckage from a cargo hold of the New York-bound jumbo jet. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> statement said: `` We have reviewed the security arrangements for flights by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers in the light of this incident, in consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, and are immediately directing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to take additional measures in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, in particular in relation to hold baggage.'' A spokesman, who by custom was not identified, refused to elaborate or give any details on the additional security measures it wants taken. The announcement followed calls by British lawmakers and aviation experts for increased security following the crash, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst aviation disaster. `` The question that now has to be asked is how and where did a bomb get on board?'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilshire </PERSON>, an aviation expert and lawmaker from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilshire </PERSON> said there were three sources of passengers on the flight: those who got on at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> where the flight originated; those who joined at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>; and 12 in transit from other flights. `` We are not therefore just talking about <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>,'' he said. The luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> security system, but luggage belonging to the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> passengers did not, although it was transferred under supervision of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> guards, said <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION>. Opposition lawmakers have protested angrily that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> never informed British airports or travelers about a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warning of a terrorist threat to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> airliner on the <LOCATION> Frankfurt-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> route in December. The government said that after receiving the threat, it had reviewed security for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights at British airports _ which already is higher than for some other destinations _ and decided it was adequate.

<TEXT>
 Two former government ministers were arrested today on corruption charges stemming from an investigation into widespread abuses under former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, officials said. Government prosecutors said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-ho </PERSON>, the former construction minister, was arrested on charges of taking bribes from construction companies in the massive urban redevelopment projects in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Also arrested was <PERSON> Cha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyu-hun </PERSON>, who once served as transportation minister under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cha </PERSON> was charged with taking bribes from businessmen for helping them obtain permits to build and operate golf courses. Prosecutors are investigating allegations of widespread corruption under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, including extortion of money from businesses, diversion of government funds, influence peddling and forced political donations. The National Assembly is investigating corruption and human rights abuses under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. Some of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s relatives and associates have been arrested or convicted of corruption, but it was the first arrest of former <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> ministers. The former ministers are also ex-generals. There have been allegations the former president collected illicit political donations through the licensing of golf courses. Licenses to build golf courses are highly profitable and much sought-after. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has denied any personal corruption, but has admitted he managed political donations. A former general who took power with military backing in 1980, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> went into voluntary rural exile last month after apologizing to the nation for abuses under his seven-year rule, which ended in February. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, a former general and once close ally of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, has asked the nation to forgive his disgraced predecessor. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> opposes punishing <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, but the opposition demands the former president appear before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s probe into his government. Opposition parties say they will not agree to consider a pardon for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> until he appears before <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> says <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> must be forgiven to promote national unity. Some opposition leaders hope nationwide furor over <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and revelations of abuses under his rule will hurt <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s chances of winning a referendum sometime next year on his rule. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> promised to hold the referendum after the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, which ended in October. The government is identified with <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> in the eyes of some <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who was elected a year ago when two candidates split the opposition vote, faces a major challenge in winning the referendum. The government has not said what <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> will do if he loses the referendum. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would not be obliged to resign, but a defeat would signal a lack of public confidence and the government would be under pressure to call elections. No date has been set for the referendum, which is expected in the spring.

 Studies of nearly 29,000 breast-cancer patients leave no doubt that drug and hormone therapies improve chances of surviving the disease, the second-leading cancer killer of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women, researchers say. Analysis of 61 studies showed that a synthetic hormone called tamoxifen improves the survival of breast cancer victims over age 50, while chemotherapy helps younger women. During the first five years after treatment, tamoxifen reduced the odds of death among older women by about one-fifth, the analysis revealed, while a combination of chemotherapy drugs reduced the odds by about one-quarter for younger victims. The studies were started as far back as 20 years ago. The analysis `` has established beyond reasonable doubt that both tamoxifen and cytotoxic chemotherapy can reduce five-year mortality,'' the researchers wrote in today's New England Journal of Medicine. The treatments already are widely used for women after surgery to remove breast tumors. In most of those studied, the disease had spread to their lymph nodes but had n't invaded other organs. `` There have been continued critics who argue that either chemotherapy or tamoxifen or both used early on did n't change survival,'' said Dr. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, one of 79 co-authors of the analysis, said that while the treatments do not necessarily cure the cancer, the review shows that `` they substantially delay death.'' Many of the studies in the analysis were too small to clearly demonstrate any effect from the treatments. But after their results were combined, the impact became apparent. The overview method `` takes out the wrinkles from all the studies,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Medical Center. `` We can use conclusions with a strong statistical foundation about the benefit and lack of benefit of treatments.'' Breast cancer is second to lung cancer as a cancer killer of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women. An estimated 135,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, and 42,300 women died of the disease. Many cancer specialists already are familiar with the findings, since they have been presented at medical meetings during the past three years. `` These data have already had a major impact on the way women are treated in this country. Now physicians will have the actual numbers in hand,'' said another co-author, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The data were reviewed by a consensus panel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> before it recommended in 1985 that tamoxifen and chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. Last May, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> told doctors that the treatment could be extended to women in the earliest stages of breast cancer that is not yet evident in the lymph nodes. The institute based its recommendation on three unpublished studies showing that cancer was slower to return when these women were treated after surgery to remove their tumors. However, that recommendation remains controversial. Some specialists contend that tamoxifen and chemotherapy should not be routinely given to women with very early breast cancer until there is proof that the treatment actually makes them live longer. Others say that even if the drugs do n't lengthen survival, they still may improve the quality of women's lives by giving them more time without cancer. Chemotherapy often carries unpleasant side effects, such as nausea and hair loss. Tamoxifen is much milder, although some women complain of hot flashes, but its long-term effects on the body are not known. Many doctors are reluctant to subject all women with early breast cancer to these powerful medicines, especially when many will remain free of cancer with surgery alone. The analysis was organized by Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peto </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and combined the results of 61 comparison studies, conducted mostly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, on 28,896 women. The researchers sought out all the studies that had been conducted, including those that found no benefit of treatment, since these are less likely than positive studies to be published in medical journals. `` We wanted the whole story,'' said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. `` The goal was to be comprehensive.''

 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> gave out wool-lined coats and long underwear to hundreds of homeless as Californians shivered in a cold spell today that apparently killed three, including a transient in an avocado grove near President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ranch. Hurricane-force winds wreaked havoc in the East. Gusts up to 77 mph Wednesday triggered the collapse of a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> factory roof that killed two people, hampered efforts to rescue the 11-man crew of a cargo ship that sank in rough seas off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and blew off part of the roof of an airport terminal near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, authorities said. More than 350,000 buildings lost power. The fast-moving cold front that brought the winds to the East left snow in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where four people died after shoveling snow in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Two jets skidded off runways at <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, which shut down for an hour Wednesday. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s cold spell entered its third day today with frost and freeze warnings for another round of temperatures in the teens, 20s or 30s in effect in many sections of the state, and in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` We wo n't get any warmer until Saturday or Sunday,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities said the cold was suspected in the deaths of the transient found Tuesday in the avocado orchard near <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, another man found Tuesday in his unheated home in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> and a man who turned up Monday in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> clad only in his underwear. The homeless fought off the cold by huddling together outdoors or taking refuge in packed emergency shelters. In downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, dozens of transients crawled into sleeping bags or flimsy cardboard shelters. `` It takes at least four blankets and still you ca n't stay warm,'' said <PERSON> Vincente </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who is 29 and homeless. The city is giving away 700 wool-lined raincoats and long underwear to help ward off the cold, said Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Skid Row shelters have been packed for a week. City buses took the overflow to 25 temporary shelters at county parks and National Guard armories. Growers statewide fired up smudge pots, switched on wind machines and flooded irrigation canals with warm water to ward off the cold that threatened citrus crops, avocados and nursery stock. The weather also triggered several serious accidents. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s high desert, a motorist distracted by a rare blanket of snow hit a guardrail, killing her 80-year-old passenger, authorities said. A tanker truck skidded on icy Interstate 5 near <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, smashed into cars and blew up in a fireball, causing two minor injuries. The winds that tore through the East were clocked at 77 mph in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, 67 mph in <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and 60 mph in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION> The wind knocked out power to 185,000 customers in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area, 100,000 in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area, 31,000 in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, nearly 11,000 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and at least 31,400 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Winds of 40-45 mph and 20 - to 25-foot seas hampered efforts to rescue 11 seamen who abandoned the cargo ship <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> before it sank 200 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, authorities said Rough seas and a shifting load were believed to have caused the sinking. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, two people were killed when sections of a factory roof crumbled and smashed into their cars, said a witness, the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falkenstein </PERSON>. The wind helped cause the roof to give way, city Licenses and Inspections Commissioner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kligerman </PERSON>. At <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the wind tore off part of the roof of the main terminal, blew out two large windows and damaged other buildings, said airport advertising manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>. There were no injuries. The wind dropped trees and debris onto houses and into evening rush-hour streets, stalling traffic in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Four vacant buildings collapsed and roofs were torn off five houses and several buildings in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area. Seven buildings collapsed in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 A judge has ordered a burglar who carries the AIDS virus to stay home and refrain from sex for five years. District Judge <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauve </PERSON> said a report confirmed that <PERSON> Argentry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaglin </PERSON>, 21, is a carrier of the virus that causes the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The sentence <PERSON> Lauve </PERSON> issued Tuesday for breaking probation also included two years of house arrest under jurisdiction of the Rapides Parish sheriff. House arrest, the judge said, means that <PERSON> Eaglin </PERSON> can not leave his home except for employment and other necessary trips. In June, <PERSON> Eaglin </PERSON> pleaded guilty to two counts of simple burglary and was put on probation. He later tried to commit suicide because he thought he had AIDS, the judge said.

<TEXT>
 As part of an Iranian crackdown on high-level corruption, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> court has sentenced to death for fraud a multimillionaire who headed an organization to help families of the country's war dead. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON> of the private <ORGANIZATION> Nabovvat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was also ordered by the court Wednesday to pay $ 17.8 million to 17 creditors, according to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> also convicted him of an `` illegitimate sexual act'' with a woman identified only as <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> B, the agency reported. The couple was sentenced to 74 lashes each by the judge, a middle-ranking clergyman identified as <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not say if the judge was related to the defendant. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulkarim </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON>, must ratify the sentence. The crackdown on corruption, which was rampant during the 8-year war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, comes as the government moves to loosen social, political and economic restrictions after the hardship and sacrifice of the war years. It also is aimed partly at luring home tens of thousands of educated exiles whom the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy wants to help rebuild the country. Ardebili has declared repeatedly that lawlessness and the excesses of revolutionary police and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> are among main obstacles preventing many of the estimated 2 million emigres from returning. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, last month called for a campaign `` to rid the people of leech-like elements affiliated to the government and the bazaar ... to end rip-offs and hoarding in government and private enterprises.'' The agency report did not say how <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON>, a former teacher, made his millions. It said he set up his supposedly non-profit foundations several years ago with capital of $ 147,000 and advertised their aim of providing no-interest loans and other services to `` the families of the martyrs.'' `` Soon <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON> was able not only to provide 250 million rials -LRB- $ 3.6 million -RRB- in loans, but to invest heavily in trade and various businesses worth more than 2 billion rials -LRB- $ 29.36 million -RRB-,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> noted. It said <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON>'s trial, which began Oct. 8, was `` a test case for a number of other cases involving savings and loan organizations that mushroomed after the Islamic revolution.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted the judge as saying: `` A lot of people thought that high-ranking officials had their hands stuck in the Nabovvat Foundation case. `` But the court followed up the issue with utmost patience, precision and fairness and, praise be to God, did not come up with anything.'' But he stressed: `` We are bound by Islam and the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> ... to bring any individual on key positions, who God forbid is involved in such issues, into this courtroom and deal with him.'' <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON>'s conviction followed that of <PERSON> Toraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansur </PERSON>, former managing director of state-run <ORGANIZATION> Saipa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> sedans. He was jailed for eight years and fined $ 236 million for embezzling $ 115 million. The official media has not disclosed how effective the anti-corruption campaign has been. But the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> Ettelat </PERSON> noted in a recent editorial: `` Cases like <ORGANIZATION> Saipa </ORGANIZATION> are not rare. `` If the government does not translate into action its will to purge ... renovation will remain nothing but an ideal.'' Travelers from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, including Iranian businessmen, have reported scores of cases in which Revolutionary Guards and officials of police revolutionary committees have demanded protection money, or confiscated goods then demanded money for their return. The corruption crackdown coincides with new moves to stamp out drug smuggling and abuse, widespread in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and to curb profiteering.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Link Between Mood and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moods of anger and depression have been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating weakness sometimes called the `` yuppie disease,'' according to a report today. `` It is possible that mood itself is one of the factors in the development of this syndrome,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>. `` People who have certain emotional makeups may be more predisposed to get this syndrome than others.'' Doctors have searched unsuccessfully for a viral cause of the illness, which is especially likely to afflict well-off young professionals. A theory that it results from the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, has largely been abandoned. Some doctors had noticed that acyclovir, a drug used against Epstein-Barr virus, seemed to relieve the syndrome. The latest study was conducted to see if it worked. The researchers found that those who took acyclvir frequently improved, but so did a comparison group that received placebos. The study found that the only factor that could clearly be linked to improvement was mood. As people's moods improved _ especially their feelings of anger and depression _ their fatigue also lessened. <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said the latest findings do not mean that the syndrome is imaginary. Instead, the symptoms may be caused by the influence of people's moods on their hormones and immune defenses. `` I think it is very possible that a person's psychological makeup could have a real impact on the expression of diseases,'' he said. He noted that people with some personality types appear to be less likely to survive heart attacks or cancer. `` You have to ask how that would work,'' he said. `` It's possible that there is a psycho-immunological or metabolic link, and that may exist in this syndrome, as well.'' The latest study, directed by <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases, was published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. Twenty-seven adults took part in the study. Neither they nor the researchers knew whether they were getting acyclovir or dummy drugs. Of the 24 who finished the study, 11 who took acyclovir and 10 who took placebos said they felt better. In most of them, the perception of improvement lasted two or three weeks after the treatment ended. However, four said their improvement lasted for at least a year. Three of these four had received placebos. Many of the patients were surprised by the study's results. Some were relieved, others dismissed the findings. <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said that some of the results are reassuring. For instance, the research found that people with the syndrome do not grow steadily worse. Instead, the symptoms come and go and can disappear for years. The link between mood and the syndrome is controversial. The study does not prove that people get better because their moods improved. In fact, <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said that the opposite might be true. `` It could not be determined whether their moods improved because they felt better or they felt better because their moods improved,'' said <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>. `` Both are possible.'' In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said it's likely that the syndrome will prove to have mental and physical causes. <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said that even though the illness has been formally recognized as a syndrome, it is not new. He said there are accounts of similar afflictions in the medical literature dating to the 1700s.

 Hazelnut growers ca n't wait to get cracking on a new promotion to make <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> the only state with an official nut.

 While his friends' fathers had medals to prove they had served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>'s dad could n't produce the goods, even though he is a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> with a distinguished service record in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. But on Wednesday he got the proof he needed. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>'s father, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police Patrolman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>, was given four ribbons and four medals for his service as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> fighting in <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> in 1965 and 1966. `` I'm proud of my father,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>, 14. `` Now I know he was really doing something in the war.'' With his wife and three children watching, the elder <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>, 44, was given the awards and a special plaque by Marine Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> at a brief ceremony at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> is assigned. `` It really felt good to finally get them, in front of the family with the kids being there,'' said <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>, a 17-year police veteran. `` A lot of us were over there, and not a lot of us were recognized for what went on.'' Col. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> reserve group at <ORGANIZATION> Glenview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> should have been decorated by his unit soon after earning the honors. But he said awards are sometimes put off when servicemen are in the field or on assignments that make ceremonies impractical. <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> said he mentioned the missing medals to <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> last month after <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had been studying the Vietnam War in school this year, asked him why he did n't have any medals to prove he had fought there. `` He was asking me about -LRB- <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> said. `` He's got some friends whose dads were there and they had medals.'' <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> said he had brought up the long-delayed awards when he chatted with <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> in early November while on assignment accompanying the general at the airport. `` It was just kind of like a fluke,'' <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> said. `` I ran into this guy, he was a general, and he went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to look up my record. And he was nice enough to come back and give -LRB- the awards -RRB- to me.'' <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said that while he does not normally deal with such matters, he was touched by <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>'s story about his son. `` He had a good record,'' <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said. `` He was a good Marine _ a fine guy who served his country well _ and we're proud to honor him. ...

 City officials appealed today for an end to the daily anti-black demonstrations that have followed a Christmas Eve fight between African students and Chinese. The embattled Africans remained sequestered. Two foreign reporters were barred from talking with the roughly 140 African students, who were being held under virtual house arrest in a guest house 1 -LCB- hours by car outside this east-central city. The Africans, accompanied by students from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, were not allowed to make telephone calls or leave the guest house other than to return to their universities in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. Chinese police forced virtually all of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s black African students to the guest house Monday after thousands of Chinese marched through the city's streets throwing rocks and destroying property at the African students' dormitories. The Chinese youth chanted `` down with black devils'' and `` black devils go home.'' The Africans, fearing for their lives, tried to leave for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but were stopped Sunday by armed police at <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s train station. The clash and demonstrations are the latest in a series of incidents between Chinese and the 1,500 African students invited here to show <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s solidarity with the Third World. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>, asked in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> whether <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> authorities had the right to hold the African students, called `` groundless'' charges that the Africans were being held illegally. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> added, `` The incident that has occurred in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> is an isolated one having nothing to do with racial discrimination.'' He said students from 40 African nations are studying in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and, `` They always get on quite well with the Chinese students. Of course, because of the difference of the customs of life, it is sometimes unavoidable for some misunderstanding and even something unpleasant.'' Today, the only African student to leave the guest house and return to <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> said he wanted to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as soon as possible. `` I am very fearful,'' said a 23-year-old from Comoros who identified himself only as <PERSON> Bourhane </PERSON> in an interview in his dormitory at <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wo n't leave this building. Even seeing a Chinese outside the window makes me cold with fright.'' In a front-page editorial, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, urged students to stop demonstrating. Students, youths and workers have been marching by the thousands since the Saturday night fight between <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials and students who refused to register the names of their Chinese female companions they were taking to a campus party. Eleven Chinese were reported injured, including one critically. On Wednesday, more than 2,000 youths jammed a major city intersection as hundreds of police gathered nearby. Riot police charged the crowd sporadically, hitting youths with rubber truncheons. Other police placed demonstrators in an unmarked van. American witnesses said protests earlier this week were highly racist in nature, with Chinese yelling, `` Kill the black devils!'' In demonstrations Tuesday and Wednesday night, however, Chinese began calling on the government to punish those involved in the fight, `` according to the law.'' `` In the beginning it was ` down with the black devils,' but we're not calling for that,'' said <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Min </PERSON>, a 23-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student `` We want matters to be settled according to law.'' At the guest house, at a chemical fiber factory to the northwest, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials refused to let Western reporters talk with the students.

<HEAD>Boston Adopts New School Enrollment Plan After Years Of Forced
Busing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After 14 years of court-ordered busing that triggered riots and white flight, the city has approved a school assignment plan that allows parents to shop around for schools closer to home. `` Clearly, it's time for change,'' school Superintendent <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said at a meeting Wednesday night in which the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> endorsed 10-1 the new student assignment plan in principle. Two committee members did not vote. The panel stopped short of full approval. It ordered <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to complete a review of the plan, which was devised by consultants, and develop ways to put it into effect, at least in part, by September. The plan would split the school system into three zones of 14,000 parents each, with parents permitted to choose any school in their zone. Students would be allowed to go to the school unless the racial balance was upset. If a school was oversubscribed, a lottery would be held, said <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>. Backers say the plan would cut the long bus rides many students now endure. They also hope the resulting inter-school competition will spur improvements and lure back whites who fled to private schools or the suburbs when the desegregation order was imposed in 1974. Critics say the plan wo n't work without more money and that it would hurt some people, such as those without access to special magnet schools. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> school woes include rundown buildings, a perennial budget crunch and a 40 percent high-school dropout rate. `` Nowhere in this plan do I see a commitment from this city to pay for choice,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, one of the two abstaining committee members. <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> said he does n't believe money will make or break the plan. The 1974 desegregation order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, stemmed from a 1972 lawsuit filed by black parents who said their children were receiving lower quality education than that at predominantly white schools. In 1975, <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> imposed the busing plan, triggering rock-throwing protests. `` We've put that kind of violence and racial strain behind us,'' committeeman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> said. `` We want all of our children to have the best education we can give them. As a city, we've grown up.'' When the lawsuit was filed, public schools served 96,000 students, 60 percent white. Today there are 59,000 students, but only 24 percent are white, although whites comprise 60 percent of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s population. Forty-eight percent of students are black, 19 percent are Hispanic and 8 percent are <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION>. As a result, some schools effectively have been resegregated, and nearly 90 percent of their pupils belong to minority groups, <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> returned some control of the system to the committee in 1985. Two years later, a federal appeals court ruled that <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> schools had integrated and that increased minority influence would prevent a return to segregated classrooms. <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> has since left the bench. His orders require only that a racial balance be maintained, freeing the committee to come up with a plan of its own. Any change in the student assignment plan would require approval by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who once was a fervent busing foe, supports the plan. He has said that schools could tap into existing funds to help fund it. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he did not know how much the new plan might cost, but said he expected there would be a request for funds.

<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Social Security officials say a quadriplegic who won a seat in the Legislature has been warned he could lose his medical benefits if he takes his newly won seat and begins drawing expense reimbursements. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kalispell </LOCATION> Republican, defeated Democrat <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> in November, to win his first term in the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>. But after drawing expense reimbursements for attending legislative caucuses in November, <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON> said he was notified the reimbursements were `` unearned income'' that would make him ineligible for continued medical benefits under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid. And <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON>, who is paralyzed from injuries he suffered in an automobile accident five years ago, says he ca n't afford to lose the money. He estimates his medical expenses at $ 15,000 a year. `` That put me in a position where I had to seriously consider whether or not I had to resign my position,'' the 27-year-old legislator-elect said. `` That amount of medical bills is n't something you can just pay. <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON> said the situation is not desperate because state and federal officials are trying to help. <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> leaders say they're considering a change in state compensation law to redefine the reimbursements, and <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON> said Social Security has advised him the case is under review. <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON> also said he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for help if need be. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> legislators earn $ 52.13 for each working day in the session plus $ 50 a day during the session as reimbursement for living expenses in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>. The 1989 session begins Monday. It's the expense reimbursement that concerns Social Security Administration officials. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredenberg </PERSON>, operations supervisor for the agency's <LOCATION> Kalispell </LOCATION> office, said that under federal law, the expense allowances are considered unearned income. Social Security disability benefits are reduced by the amount of unearned income over $ 20 that a person receives, he said. And a person who loses eligibility for those payments because of unearned income also loses eligibility for medical coverage, he said. Most people receiving disability payments do n't work or do n't travel to work, <PERSON> Fredenberg </PERSON> noted, saying a situation such as <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON>'s arises `` very, very seldom. <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON> said he checked into the federal regulations before he filed for office last spring. He said he was told then he would qualify for continued medical benefits if elected, under a program that allows people to continue receiving medical coverage even if they are working. <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON> said Social Security officials have since told him he should be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. But, he said, he has n't yet received written verification. <PERSON> Fredenberg </PERSON> said he could not comment directly on <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON>'s case because of federal privacy laws. <PERSON> Boharski </PERSON> said if legislation at the state level does n't resolve the problem, he will try to have changes made at the federal level so he can retain his legislative seat. `` I'm counting on staying,'' he said. `` Anyone who knows me knows I do n't quit that easy.''

<HEAD>Sakharov's Wife Says Gorbachev OK'd Ethnic Peace Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a close confidant approved a trip to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> to seek a compromise in the republics' bitter ethnic dispute, the human rights activist's wife said today. <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that she and her husband, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, were in a five-member delegation that visited the capitals of the southern republics and <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the largest city in the region at the center of the dispute. She said the group returned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday and may make another trip to the region, which has been wracked by 10 months of violence. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> demands annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian enclave in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said the mission had the backing of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, the member of the ruling Politburo considered closest to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Asked whether the officials or <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a 67-year-old nuclear physicist, proposed the mission, and how the leaders had expressed their backing, <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said: `` If he wanted to publicize this, he would.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s approval of the <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> mission, however, is further evidence of the gaining official stature of a man exiled to the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in 1980 for criticizing the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In December 1986, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and said he could return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was restored to good graces at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and has been quoted frequently in the official press. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> declined to say who the group met with during its trip or what was discussed. The mission was aimed at resolving a protracted dispute over control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The district has been part of predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. Armenians, who are mostly Christian, insist that the region should be annexed to the Armenian republic. The central government has refused to side with the Armenians, and strikes, riots and demonstrations have plagued both republics since February. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the dispute threatens his reform effots and has expressed anger at activists who continually raise the issue. During a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> proposed a compromise. He recommended that Nagorno-Karabhk be taken out of <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> hands and placed temporarily under a central administration. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has also called for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers to investigate the ethnic unrest. In the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vigen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON>, a journalist for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` tried to find compromises'' in a meeting with Armenian scientists at their <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. None of the scientists familiar with the meeting was available today, said an academy secretary. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, a former Armenian political prisoner and literary critic, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> also visited a center for Armenians who fled <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> because of violence in connection with the territorial dispute. At least 60 people have been killed. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, asked about the trip Wednesday, said, `` As far as I know he went there as a member of a group of academics and scholars. That trip had nothing to do with any authority whatsoever.'' In <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the group met with the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiator in the ethnic dispute, <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>. It appeared the group's ostensible reason for visiting the region was to review conditions at a controversial nuclear power plant near <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. The Soviet leadership has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to study the power station. Many Armenians feared the plant was damaged in the Dec. 7 earthquake, which claimed about 55,000 lives and left a half million people homeless. Soviet officials have repeatedly said the plant, which is built on a fault, was not damaged. Nevertheless, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> says it will be closed in two years because of the earthquake danger.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has officially been sold to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> real estate investor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, but spurned suitors for the television ministry have left the door open to appeal the decision. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> signed an order Wednesday formally selling the assets of the Christian ministry to Mernick for $ 65 million. That gives <ORGANIZATION> Mernick </ORGANIZATION> 11 days to come up with a $ 3.25 million deposit and 41 days until he can assume administration and operation of PTL. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has been in bankruptcy court since June 1987, three months after its founder, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, resigned in a sex and money scandal. The Rev. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and president of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, told said he has n't given up his hope to buy Fort Mill, S.C.-based PTL. Last week, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s independent religious arm would continue to raise money in case <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s deal falls through. He said <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, through extensions, could delay the closing until September. `` We plan to buy <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian retreat. `` That's been our plan all along. <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> has not been sold.

Obviously, nothing's been sold. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> has raised $ 5.4 million, which is being held in an interest-bearing escrow account. If <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> does n't get a chance to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, the donations but not the interest will be returned, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said.

On Wednesday, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> declined to say whether <PERSON> Bahakel </PERSON> would follow through with an appeal. `` We have to see the order itself to know exactly what we plan to do,'' he said. Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has said he is willing to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> about keeping alive <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting on the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> satellite television network.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Fate Of Bucky, A `Super Pit Bull Dog'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some say <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON> is mutt, others say it's a `` super pit bull.'' A judge's decision on the matter ultimately could cost the dog its life under the state's new anti-vicious-dog law. <LOCATION> Lucas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Dog Warden <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeldon </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON> apparently is a `` super pit bull'' _ part pit bull, part <LOCATION> Rhodesian </LOCATION> ridgeback _ making it extremely dangerous. A Rhodesian ridgeback is known as an African lion hound because of its ability to hunt lions, <PERSON> Skeldon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON>, he said, has the aggressiveness of a ridgeback and the tenacity of a pit bull. <PERSON> Skeldon </PERSON> said mixed breeding is on the rise because some people see it as a way of circumventing <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s new vicious-dog law, which was passed in 1987 after a Dayton-area doctor was fatally attacked by two pit bulls. The law singles out only pit bulls. `` We can foresee larger pit bulls coming into the pound, and pit bull crosses with larger breeds. We've never seen one this large before,'' <PERSON> Skeldon </PERSON> said about <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON>, who weighs about 90 pounds. `` We hear there's an attempt to cross pit bulls with breeds so that it does n't look like a pit bull, and there also is the tendency to breed the dog with a larger animal. This is frightening,'' he said. County deputy dog wardens on Dec. 15 confiscated <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON>, who is licensed, after the dog was seen running loose from its yard, which had an open gate. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, a deputy dog warden, said the pound was notified by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service, which complained that the dog chased one a letter carrier, who had to use a spray deterrent to keep the dog at bay. The owner, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, was cited for having a vicious dog improperly confined and for having no liability insurance. Her attorney, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, disputes <PERSON> Skeldon </PERSON>'s contentions that <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON> is a pit bull. `` It is my understanding that it is not a pit bull. I know the owners say it is n't,'' he said. He said talking about the case would be premature because of a Jan. 12 pretrial conference in Municipal Court. If a judge determines the dog is a pit bull, he can order it destroyed. The previous attack classifies <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON> as a dangerous dog under the law, but the question remains whether he is a pit bull, the only breed listed in the state statue as a vicious dog. Penalities for violations involving dangerous dogs and vicious dogs are similar, but the law requires the owner of a vicious dog to carry proof of liability insurance, which is often difficult to obtain. <PERSON> Skeldon </PERSON> said he thinks the dog is a threat to the public. `` I am willing to euthanize the dog if that's the case. But if I am told by the court to return the dog to its owners, I will comply with that also,'' he said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said today that he would keep his new justice minister despite the man's history of donations from a company at the center of a stock scandal that reaches deep into Japanese politics. Opposition parties demanded the resignation of <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> because he has admitted receiving donations for 12 years from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which his office is probing for suspected bribery. <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> was named to the justice portfolio on Tuesday as <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> reshuffled his Cabinet and launched an ethics reform drive in a bid to put the Recruit scandal behind him. But <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s attempts to restore confidence in his government seemed to be falling apart Wednesday night when the justice minister confirmed he had taken money from Recruit. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, after consulting leaders of his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he would keep <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> even though the new justice minister had not been prudent in accepting the donations. `` But I fully trust that his ability will allow him to fulfill his responsibility as justice minister,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, 76, told a news conference this afternoon he had learned only Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had been paying membership dues since 1976 in an organization called Hakusenkai, which helps finance <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s campaign and political activities. He said it was `` truly careless'' of him not to have known about the donations, and he apologized. But, he continued, `` As justice minister I do n't think this matter will be an impediment. Accordingly, I will carry out my duties as justice minister in the future.'' <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> had told reporters Tuesday he had no links to the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` and that's why I can appear before you'' as the new justice minister. But news reports Wednesday night said Recruit had been giving money to <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> for 12 years, and that the last donation had been in October, when the Recruit scandal was front-page news every day. The donations totaled $ 46,000. The donations were legal and quite different from the transactions in shares of a Recruit subsidiary called Recruit-Cosmos that so far have brought the resignations of 17 politicians and businessmen. <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> told a late-night news conference Wednesday that he had asked his aides, including his son, <PERSON> Akira </PERSON>, whether they had received <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares, and when they said no, he felt able to take the justice portfolio. But he said he had n't asked whether Recruit had given him political donations. <PERSON> Mitsuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaneko </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s secretariat, told a news conference that <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> should resign and `` the prime minister's responsibility in appointing him should not be escaped as well. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Clean Government Party -RRB-, said <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> was inappropriate to serve as justice minister. Prosecutors have questioned Recruit founder <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> as well as officials of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant telephone utility, about business links between Recruit and the utility. The scandal has been developing since last summer, when it emerged that <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> had sold bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos to influential politicians and business figures before the shares were listed. Another Recruit subsidiary gave interest-free loans to finance some of the transactions, and when the shares were listed in 1986, the price rose sharply and the shareholders made hefty profits. The sales were not illegal under the securities law but they appeared to be ethically dubious ways for a company to give donations above the limit of one million yen -LRB- $ 8,000 -RRB- a year, if not bribes, to have the officials give advantages to Recruit, a huge conglomerate based on employment services. The <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary deals in real estate. Some of the shareholders made over $ 80,000 in tax-free profits.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s main international airport and seaport were idled and its key cities paralyzed today by a general strike in protest of the government-decreed price hikes in basic commodities. Telephone and Telex operators in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, said all lines to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> were out of order, indicating telecommunications workers had made good their threat to join the strike and cut <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s links with the outside. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> called an emergency cabinet meeting for today, and hinted he might give in to the strikers' demands. Meanwhile, the governing coalition's junior partner, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, quit the government Wednesday in sympathy with the strikers. The unionists dominate the powerful 2-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which called the strike. The Unionists had been under grass-roots pressure for some time to quit the government because it failed to follow through with a plan party leader <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> negotiated to end a 5 -LCB- - year civil war in the south <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> resignations of the six unionist cabinet members, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Salih </PERSON>. In a statement, the Unionists called for `` a national reconciliation government'' to roll back the price increases, implement the peace agreement and prepare for elections. <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> had called on the Sudanese not to engage in `` destruction and rioting,'' adding, `` The democratic system is capable through its institutions to take decisions, then study them and reform them if necessary through democratic means.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s financially strapped government increased the price of sugar by 600 percent and cigarettes by 50 percent and levied a 15 percent sales tax on all commodities. Ministers explained the increases were to finance subsidies as well as salary increases of 50 percent to 500 percent decreed two days earlier for public and private employees. The edict covered 1 million government workers. Newspapers and the official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that many of the country's major cities were at a standstill today. Reports from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, the principal <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port, said a strike began last Saturday and that police had arrested several people. The shutdown apparently was to protest the government's alleged reneging on a promise to make pay increases retroactive to July 1 They were made effective Dec. 1. On Wednesday, all union workers at <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> International Airport left their posts. Officials in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> said flights that normally crossed Sudanese airspace were being rerouted because of the lack of communications with <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> air traffic controllers. Other major central <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> towns _ <LOCATION> Dongola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atbara </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wad </PERSON> <PERSON> Medani </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sennar </LOCATION> _ were reported in complete paralysis because of the work stoppage The general strike took hold after two days of demonstrations in the capital. Thousands remained on the streets Wednesday night. One group, as it passed the Ministry of Information, shouted: `` The head of the prime minister is a public demand!'' Similar unrest in March 1985 ended the 16-year authoritarian rule of President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>. His defense minister led a coup in early April that began a process leading to the return of civilian rule a year later.

<HEAD>Report: French Girls Freed In Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two French girls held for 13 months by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist group arrived today in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and will be turned over to <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities, the state-run Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported The news came just minutes after Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said the government's efforts to win the release of the girls were on the verge of succeeding. An employee in <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> office, reached by telephone, said the release of the girls, Marie-Laure, 7, and her sister, <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>, 6, came after an appeal from <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. `` Following the appeal by the ` Guide of the Revolution -LRB- <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> -RRB-' on the occasion of Christmas for the release of hostages detained in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the two little French girls Marie-Laure and <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON> have been freed,'' the employee said, reading the <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> dispatch. The dispatch did not say from whence the girls arrived. `` The two little French girls arrived in the city of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> and measures have been taken so they can be turned over today to a delegate of the government and their family,'' <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, spokesman for the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that the girls had been freed and were on their way home. The group has since issued a series of contradictory statements about the girls. `` The efforts undertaken a long time ago by the government for the release of Marie-Laure and <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON> are on the point of succeeding,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said in a statement in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` A group has been in place for several days and a special envoy, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> ambassador, is present in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>.'' Fatah-Revolutionary Council has been holding the girls, their mother, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, and five Belgians since they seized their yacht last year. The group claimed it seized the yacht off the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that the adult hostages were Israeli spies. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> denies the charge. Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, who is separated from the father of Marie-Laure and <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>, gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in a recent videotape that she is again pregnant.

<HEAD>Agreement Will Open Up Soviet Jewish Grave Sites, Activist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jewish cemeteries in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be preserved and visitors will have greater access to historical and religious documents under a new agreement, a Jewish activist says. `` The Soviets have gone out of their way to work with us to preserve many of the traditions that exist in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' City Councilman <PERSON> Noach </PERSON> <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> said Wednesday, a day after his return from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Many Jewish leaders are buried in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including the founder of Hasidism, Rabbi <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ben <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON>, or the Ba'al <PERSON> Shem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tov </PERSON>, who is buried in the Ukrainian town of <LOCATION> Medzhibozh </LOCATION>, said Dear, co-chair of the private <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Preservation of <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The history of the Jews is basically in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the present time,'' said Dear. Under the agreement with Soviet officials, cities and historical sites that had been closed to outsiders would be opened to Jews from around the world, Dear announced Wednesday. The Soviets also agreed to assist visitors and preserve Jewish grave sites and historical documents, <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> said. He said the agreement also would help keep Jewish life alive in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as outsiders visit the burial sites and `` give a little life to the Jewish community that exists in many of these cities and towns which probably have never seen outside Jewish leaders.'' Dear said many Jewish cemeteries and grave sites are in poor condition and that members of the committee would return soon to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to catalogue the sites. `` These are significant steps in a world that was closed off to us,'' said committee co-chair <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twerski </PERSON>. `` As the doors open up and as their attitudes become more positive we will be pressing for additional rights for Soviet Jews.'' Another sign of improvement in the way Jews are treated under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms is increased Soviet Jewish emigration. In November, 2,284 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, slightly lower than the 2,480 figure for October that marked the highest monthly total since 1980 but still a high level. Soviet authorities also have loosened restrictions on the teaching of Hebrew and are planning a Jewish cultural center in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 A security guard was shot during an apparent robbery at a supermarket early today and two other employees and a customer who hid after hearing the gunfire had to be coaxed out of the store, police said. The wounded security guard, who was shot several times, was found by another customer entering <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s Food Mart at about 12:20 a.m. The customer ran to a restaurant and told an employee to summon police. Police surrounded the supermarket when initial reports indicated the gunman was still inside. Authorities established telephone contact with the people in the store, and persuaded two men to come outside about 3 a.m.. One said he was a store employee, the other said he was a customer, according to police A woman who identified herself as a store employee locked herself in a room at the back of the store and refused to come out, police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> said.

 Relaxed after a private quail hunting trip, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was headed for <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> today for a few hours of fishing before buckling down to work back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. With his inauguration about three weeks away, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had retreated for three days to a 10,000-acre ranch 70 miles from <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> for an annual stint of quail hunting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a keen outdoorsman, teamed up today with a friend, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, for some fishing on <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s private lake at <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is founder of <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportsman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and headed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 presidential campaign in Before leaving from <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was taking a few minutes for a nostalgic gesture that recalled his days as a fighter pilot in World War II. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to sign his wife's name, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, across the fuselage of a restored <ORGANIZATION> TBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenger </ORGANIZATION>, a torpedo bomber of the sort he flew in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who named his planes after his then-fiancee, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, narrowly escaped death when he was shot down on a bombing mission Sept. 2, 1944. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s regular tail gunner on bombing missions, was joining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the fuselage signing ceremony. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not accompany her husband to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, remaining instead in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to pack for the move to the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> TBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenger </ORGANIZATION>, one of about 20 of that type left in the world, was restored by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> pilot from <LOCATION> Hawkins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> estimated the project, which he did for a hobby, cost about $ 20,000. In <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled about six hours on <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s private lake about 15 miles from <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a conservationist and long-time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter, said the vice president called him to arrange the outing. `` We just want to get in some fishing,'' he said. To give him more time for fishing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered his departure time moved up by about two hours today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't have much luck on a post-election fishing trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and he found quail hunting harder than in previous years because of the dry conditions, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, spokesman for the president-elect, said. `` They have been successful on the hunt, but not as successful as in past years,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't volunteer how many birds he had bagged, he said. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` very relaxed, very upbeat,'' after the hunting, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> added. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was isolated at the Lazy F Ranch, owned by his friend, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>, his transition office announced that he had selected <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the No. 2 official at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, to be the new deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a statement, called <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs, `` admirably suited for this key position.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> native and a career <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employee, will report to <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has designated as his national security adviser. Neither job requires <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. To replace <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s current deputy director for intelligence whose background is in East Asian affairs. The Kerr appointment is subject to confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was notified in advance about a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> announcement that investigators determined a bomb had caused the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane last week, but he had no comment on it, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Joining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his vacation were <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the designated secretary of state, and his wife, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, and the president-elect's brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that when he returns to the nation's capital, he will concentrate on policy and legislative issues as well as the budget. He still has one Cabinet job, energy secretary, to fill, and he is looking for a drug czar, a Cabinet-level job. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not said when another announcement will be forthcoming, but aides indicated it could be as early as Friday.

<TEXT>
 Two sons of a cattle rancher who favored clearing the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> for grazing have been arrested in connection with the killing of an ecologist who fought to preserve the jungle, police say. <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oloci </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> were captured after a gun battle with police Tuesday night on their family ranch in <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, the jungle town where <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was gunned down last week, Deputy Minister of Justice <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Oloci </PERSON> was wounded in the shootout. The two are sons of <PERSON> Darly </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a rancher who was angry over <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>' campaign to save the rain forest. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> had said the rancher threatened to kill him. The internationally known ecologist, who organized jungle workers to try to stop destruction of the rain forest by plantation owners, was fatally shot Thursday outside his home in <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, 2,650 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. The issue of how to develop the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, an expanse of rain forest about two-thirds the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has often erupted in violent conflicts between landowners, landless peasants, politicians, clergymen and ecologists who defend the peasants. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, about 4 percent of the population owns half of the arable land. Cattle ranchers, eager to clear forest lands for grazing, often order the killings of squatters and ecologists who oppose them. Some experts say uncontrolled burning of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> is aggravating the greenhouse effect _ atmospheric warming caused by the buildup of carbon dioxide. Federal police were still looking for five other members of the rancher's family in connection with <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>' death, <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON> said. A third son, 21-year-old <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, turned himself in to police Monday and claimed he hired someone to kill <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>. Officials said they did not believe the confession. `` Our impression is that <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON>'s confession is a smoke screen,'' said <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON>. `` We wo n't stop our search until we get to his boss.'' On Wednesday, police began a 48-hour operation to confiscate illegal weapons in the region in an effort to halt widespread violence in the western <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. Two years ago, federal police carried out a similar campaign in the Parrot's Beak region of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a rural area 1,800 miles north of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> torn by land disputes. They set up roadblocks, searched vehicles, raided ranches and confiscated hundreds of unregistered arms, but the violence continued unchecked. Violent conflicts over land have increased since President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, the first civilian president since a 21-year military regime ended in 1985, announced a sweeping agrarian reform program. Since 1985, about 250 deaths a year have resulted from land conflicts. In 1971, just 20 people were killed in 109 battles, according to government figures.

<HEAD>Government Proposes New Controls On Pre-Cooked Meat Patties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is considering new federal labeling and processing rules to ensure that certain kinds of meat patties, including pre-cooked hamburgers, are safe to eat. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said there has been `` increasing evidence over the past several years'' that disease organisms survive in products that many consumers erroneously believe are fully cooked when bought. The proposal would affect fully cooked, partially cooked and `` char-marked'' ground meat patties. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said examples include such items as `` Char-Broiled Beef Patties,'' and `` Pre-Browned Fresh Pork Sausage Patties.'' `` As these types of covenenience products continue to become more popular we must establish requirements to reduce the potential for food-borne illnesses,'' he said. Recently, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said, a strain of bacteria _ <PERSON> Escherichia </PERSON> <PERSON> coli </PERSON> _ was linked to an outbreak of food poisoning which hospitalized six <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> school children with severe diarrhea and cramps. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> determined that undercooked beef patties caused the illness, although the specific strain of bacteria that infected the children has not been isolated from the patties. The proposed rule would establish requirements for the storage of raw ingredients, processing times and temperatures, handling to prevent contamination after processing, and labels that include cooking instruction for final preparation. For example, he said, the partially cooked ground meat patties would bear the label statement, `` Partially Cooked: For Safety, <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Until </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Well </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Done </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Internal Temperature of 160 F -RRB-.''

 Rescuers plucked four seamen from the stormy <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> after their 250-foot cargo ship sank, but one died and seven others were missing today, including a crewman who slipped through his life jacket, authorities said. An aircraft flying over the area spotted one of the men on a life raft, but rescuers found the raft empty when they reached it. Rescuers later spotted another man in the water, but they were unsure whether he was alive. The rescue effort was hampered by heavy rains, 40 - to 45-mph winds and 20 - to 25-foot seas, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> The 11-member crew abandoned the <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bermuda </ORGANIZATION> in two rafts after the ship's load shifted during the storm Wednesday night, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumble </PERSON>. The ship sank about 160 miles south of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> and 200 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trumble </PERSON> said. The captain sent a distress signal at 7:10 p.m. and lost communication about five minutes later, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. A merchant vessel, the Eagle, which was nearest to the <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bermuda </ORGANIZATION> when it went down, was guided to one of the rafts by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. Two <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON> crew members were pulled aboard the Eagle about 1:45 a.m. today, but a third was lost at sea during a rescue attempt, he said. `` The Eagle recovered two and in the process of trying to get the third guy on board, he slipped through the life jacket and back into the water and they ca n't see him now,'' he said. The two men aboard the Eagle were conscious and alert, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. They were treated for mild hypothermia but were otherwise unharmed. Their identities were not released. About 4 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> frogmen jumped from a helicopter and saved two men who were drifting without rafts in the water, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. They were taken by helicopter to <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where nursing supervisor <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Correia </PERSON> said one was dead on arrival at about 6:45 a.m., apparently of hypothermia. The other, identified as <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Macio-Lopez </PERSON>, 35, was in fair condition in the intensive care unit. An aircraft flying over the area spotted a man on a life raft about 7:30 a.m., but rescuers later found the raft empty, Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. Rescuers saw another man in the water but could not reach him because of rough seas. Two helicopters, a jet from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> air station on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> and a C-130 aircraft from <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, began searching for survivors late Wednesday. But the helicopters ran low on fuel after about 90 minutes and returned to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trumble </PERSON> said. Another C-130 was dispatched from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> shortly after the first two crew members were rescued. The <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON>, registered in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, is a container ship that makes a regular weekly run from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arbogast </PERSON> said. It was believed to be carrying general cargo, including food and building materials, and is one of the three main supply vessels to the island nation off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

 Military base spokesmen today reacted with a stiff upper lip to a government commission's cost-cutting proposal to close 86 bases nationwide, but civilians decried the effects the closings would have on their economies. Politicians declared victory in areas where bases were spared by the measure, which would save an estimated $ 5.6 billion over 20 years. `` We're not going to fight with anybody. It's not our decision. Things are going to fall where they're going to fall,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacovelli </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> serves as headquarters for the 4th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which includes reservists in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. It employs about 1,500 civilians and 1,500 military personnel. `` The decision has been made and like any decision, we'll press on and carry it out,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherlin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I want to stress that it's only a recommendation. ... We're not going to shut our gates tomorrow.'' The base employs about 7,000 people in <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION>, a town of 20,000. Plans to shut down the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Sixth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered, was a surprise to Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' office. `` What we heard was that it will close partially,'' said mayoral spokeswoman <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. She said the announcement will have to be studied and run through `` a number cruncher'' before the mayor would be ready to comment on what it means to the city in terms of lost jobs and money. `` It will depend, I guess, on how many people will be gored by this,'' she said. `` We're not pleased it's closing. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Agnos </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has already signed onto the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Save the Presidio.'' In addition to the complete closure of 86 bases, 59 others were slated for partial closing or realignment. Among those was <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s largest military base. The panel recommended that it be reduced to `` semi-active status'' for an annual savings of $ 84.5 million. The base, now one of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s eight basic-training posts, would lose that function entirely The announcement was bad news for the <ORGANIZATION> Pemberton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, whose schools are attended by children of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>'s military personnel <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON>, business administrator for the district, said children of base personnel comprise 38 percent of its student body. `` We are in the middle of adding an addition to our high school because they have been expanding the base,'' he said. A historic fort built to protect stagecoach travelers from Indian attack also fell under the ax. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, built in 1862 in the foothills of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, had long been criticized by congressional foes as contributing little to national defense. `` I'm sure there's going to be people disappointed who work here,'' said Army Maj. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Auer </PERSON>, the fort's spokesman. `` One of the things we have to contend with is 44 of our buildings here are also registered national historic landmarks.'' Not all the news from the report was bad. Several communities were elated by the panel's recommendation to expand several facilities. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, welcomed the proposal to add 661 military and 126 civilian personnel at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` Fort <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is one of our nation's finest and most vital military training facilities and I am enthusiastic about the increase of its role in providing for our nation's defense,'' he said. Although the commission report spelled doom for the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had long anticipated closing, the announcement brought relief to supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>. `` We won,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, standing with workers at the gate of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base and shipyard, which employs about 8,500 people. `` We are going to stay open,'' he said. `` I am happy. In fact I am thrilled the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and Naval shipyard is not on the list of defense facilities that are to be closed around the country. The workers won. This is their victory.'' Residents of <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, site of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s only <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base, also rejoiced at being spared. `` It's the best news we could have for a New Year's,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, owner of a local card shop and a director of the town's chamber of commerce `` It's the life and blood of the town. It would have been devastating if <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION> had been closed.''

<HEAD>Armenian Officials Cool to Sakharov Mediation in Ethnic Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top Armenian official on Thursday dismissed the mediation effort by human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in the bloody <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> ethnic dispute, saying authorities can settle the matter on their own. `` I think we have sufficient help and advice from the government and party on the <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> issue,'' said <PERSON> Vardges </PERSON> <PERSON> Artsruny </PERSON>, a deputy premier of the Armenian republic, when asked if officials welcomed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s mission. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a 67-year-old physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, returned Monday from a trip to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the neighboring republic with which it is feuding, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians familiar with the mission said it was aimed at seeking a compromise in the 10-month-old rift over control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Armenians began strikes and demonstrations in February to press their demand that the territory, part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923, be incorporated into the Armenian republic. Azerbaijanis have refused to cede the district, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> authorities have sided with them. Clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the dispute have left at least 60 people dead. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> on the trip with three other people she declined to identify, said President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his closest ally, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, had approved the trip. She said the group visited the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, but declined to say whom they met or exactly what they discussed. Asked whether the officials or <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> proposed the mission, and how the leaders had expressed their backing, <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said: `` If he wanted to publicize this, he would.'' Artsruny, the deputy premier, was asked about the <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> mission in a television hookup in which Moscow-based reporters put questions to Armenian officials in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s help was not needed and then lashed out at journalists who raised the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> issue while <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was suffering from the Dec. 7 earthquake. Another deputy premier, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hojamiryan </PERSON>, said he met with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> but that they only discussed earthquake relief efforts, not the ethnic dispute. Also in the news conference, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s Interior Minister, <PERSON> Usik </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutunyan </PERSON>, said his forces had restored order to the republic and that there had been `` no conflicts stemming from racism'' recently. Authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and sent tanks and troops into many parts of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> late last month to quell ethnic unrest. Several Armenian political activists have been arrested. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the ethnic dispute threatens his reform program known as perestroika and has expressed anger at activists who continually raise the issue. During a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> recommended the disputed territory be taken out of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s hands and placed temporarily under a central administration <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> also called for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers to investigate the ethnic unrest. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s approval of the mission reflects <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s improving official standing. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his human rights campaigning, but was exiled to the city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in 1980 for criticizing the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In December 1986, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and said he could return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He was restored to good graces at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and has been quoted frequently in the press.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had her first meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Thursday and urged her fellow south <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> leaders to spend less money on weapons and more on fighting disease and poverty. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> assumed the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> and opened the first session of the seven-nation summit, then met with the leader of the nation that has long been her country's bitter rival. Less than a month after <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first free elections in 11 years propelled her into the prime minister's job and made her the first woman leader of a modern Moslem nation, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> used the summit to call for a reassessment of priorities in the impoverished Asian subcontinent. `` Some of us are spending too great a proportion of our national resources on defense, maintaining large military forces that face each other,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said, speaking in English with an accent that reflects both her <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> educations. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, whose country spends almost 40 percent of its budget on defense, added: `` The truth is that our people face the same common problems _ the problems of poverty, disease, slums, ignorance and unemployment _ and it is to the vanquishing of these enemies that we should direct all our efforts.'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, in his speech at the opening session in the auditorium of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, also spoke of the need to translate the group's scores of seminars and study groups into concrete action. `` In each of our countries, the highest priority is the war on poverty,'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said. `` Until we make -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- a people's movement, its achievements will lie recorded only in dusty files or molder in the cabinets of our bureaucracies. `` We have not taken even one full step down the road towards regional cooperation of a kind which interfaces with our people on development issues at the grassroots,'' ghe said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> urged fellow members `` to seek regional solutions for curbing the arms race and the danger of nuclear proliferation of war.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons program and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s ability to manufacture nuclear arms have been a major obstacle to friendlier relations between the two countries. Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has fought three wars with predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> since 1947, when the two nations were created through partition along religious lines out of the British colonial <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> chatted occasionally with <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> while seated on the platform at the 2 -LCB- - hour opening session of the fourth annual summit She saw him privately afterward, and two more private sessions are scheduled Friday and Saturday. Their meeting has eclipsed the presence of the five other leaders: President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Jigme </PERSON> <PERSON> Singhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wangchuk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. But the summit, by providing a venue for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> to get to know each other, has prompted hopes that this new generation of Indian and Pakistani leaders can transcend the bitter memories of their nations' intertwined histories. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, 44, took office in 1984 after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, 35, led her <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to an electoral triumph in last month's Parliament elections On Dec. 2, she was sworn in as prime minister, a post held by her father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulkifar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who was ousted in a military coup in 1977 and later executed. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, with 880 million people, and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with 107 million, are the mightiest military and political powers of the nations, which have a combined population of 1.1 billion.

 A government commission today proposed closing, partially closing or changing the missions of 145 military bases or installations for savings of $ 693 million a year. The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure called for closing 86 installations, including 52 military housing units. Five more installations would be partially closed and 54 others would get new missions and additional personnel. If <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> accepts the commission's recommendations, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to either accept them all or reject them all Under the procedure it enacted, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, historically reluctant to close bases, can not spare some of the facilities while letting others close. Under a formula taking into account future inflationary costs and other factors, the commission estimated savings would amount to $ 5.6 billion over a 20-year period. That would amount to a minuscule part of defense costs; the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget runs now at about $ 300 billion a year. `` My initial impression is favorable. My general feeling is that this will be well received by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> He said the odds `` are heavily in favor'' of the recommendations taking effect. `` The recommended changes reflect an opportunity to improve the nation's defense position,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, who headed a commission which presented the list of recommended changes at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news conference this morning. Co-chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, said the panel used `` improvement in military value of our domestic base structure as the pre-eminent consideration.'' `` Our report presents an opportunity to reduce training costs in terms of manpower, overhead costs and fuel, to improve command and control, consolidate training and improve economies of scale and to remove unnecessary administrative burdens to our defense managers,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` Despite these improvements, we do not anticipate any substantial socio-economic disruption to the communities that are closely linked to the bases that are recommended for closure,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The largest affected bases were five <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases _ <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, all recommended for closing; plus three <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> installations _ <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, to partially close, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to close and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, to partially close _ and one naval installation, the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, to close. Other important bases that would be affected are <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, to partially close, and the Jefferson Proving Ground, in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, to close. A naval station at Hunters Point, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, would not be built. Several facilities will gain personnel from the changes, including the <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and the Naval Station at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The news came as a blow to several communities, but others that were spared exulted. `` We won,'' said <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, standing with workers at the gate of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, which employs about 8,500 people. `` We are going to stay open,'' he said. Implementation of the recommendations would follow a complex procedure involving <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, both Houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after he becomes president on Jan. 20. The process, which requires that the whole package of proposals be either accepted or rejected, is designed to withstand political pressure from congressmen trying to protect bases in their districts. Former Missouri Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>, a commission member, complained that the armed services, especially the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, had impeded the panel's work. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ultimately gave its cooperation,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said in an `` additional view'' at the close of the 88-page final report. `` The Army begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> stonewalled, and got away with it,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>'s statement said. `` Intransigence paid off. When the new secretary of defense looks to further base closings as a means of trimming the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, he should most certainly start with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ` refused to play' this time: it should be obliged to next time,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> presented the report to Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, copies were delivered simultaneously to the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees: Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> Before the commission acted today, and aide to <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said his office had been besieged with telephone calls from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trying to learn whether their districts were affected. The Pentagon has closed no major installations since 1977, mainly because of pressure from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with major bases in their districts. Members of the commission visited about 40 bases during a seven-month examination of the nation's 3,800 military installations. The review generally centered on the 870 largest bases, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbee </PERSON>, a commission spokesman. The estimated annual savings of $ 693 million cited by <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> fell far short of earlier <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> estimates, which reached as high as $ 5 billion. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> had said that $ 2 billion a year was `` a more realistic figure.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said his panel did not start out with specific targets, either in number of bases to be closed or in dollars saved. Release of the panel's report was the biggest step yet in the process set up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to close unneeded bases and remove congressmen from the political heat that follows the lost jobs. The Edwards panel was approved in the waning days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as a political compromise by legislators who wanted to reduce the federal budget deficit and also avoid constituent criticism. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will have until Jan. 15 _ five days before he leaves office _ to accept or reject the panel's findings. He will not have the option of picking or choosing among the bases. Approval of the package by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> would send the issue back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which may block the closings if both pass resolutions against them. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after he becomes president, would have the right to veto that resolution, and his veto could be overridden by a two-thirds majority of both houses.

<HEAD>California Court Restricts Suits by Fired Employees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today restricted the right of fired workers to sue their employers on the grounds that a dismissal broke a promise of continued employment. In a victory for employers, the court ruled 4-3 that a worker who is fired without good cause, in violation of a company's express or implied promise, can sue only for reinstatement and back pay, and not for emotional distress and punitive damage awards that often are much larger. Citing the need for `` commercial stability,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> wrote that it was `` important that employers not be unduly deprived of discretion to dismiss an employee by the fear that doing so will give rise to potential tort recovery -LRB- for additional damages -RRB- in every case.'' The court allowed employees to seek the additional damages when their firings involved violations of public policy, such as a worker's refusal to violate a law. But <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> placed new limits on such lawsuits, saying the policy involved must serve the public and not merely the employer's interests. One pro-employee aspect of the ruling was the court's willingness to allow lawsuits to proceed based on an oral promise of continued employment. Justice <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, who wrote one of three separate dissenting opinions, accused the majority of `` a radical attempt to rewrite <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law in a manner which ... will leave the wrongfully discharged worker without an adequate remedy.'' The ruling reinstates but sharply limits a lawsuit by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who was fired from his $ 56,164-a-year job as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> branch manager of <ORGANIZATION> Interactive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, after telling the company that his boss was being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for embezzlement from a former employer. The boss later pleaded guilty to embezzlement. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who had a spotless record in nearly seven years of employment, refused a transfer to another office and was fired two days after he got a merit bonus of $ 6,762. His lawsuit, still in the pretrial stages, contends the firing violated a company promise of continued employment and was a pretext for covering up wrongdoing, in violation of public policy. Today's ruling allowed <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to proceed with his lawsuit but limited his potential damages to lost salary payments

 Q. Congressman -LRB- Les -RRB- <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> -LRB- D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- suggested that there was a loophole in this whole procedure and that funds had to be appropriated annually to close these bases and, by use of that loophole, bases could be prevented from being closed Did you address that question and what did you do about it? EDWARDS: There is a problem, because the proceeds of the sales of these facilities will go into the fund to carry out the purposes of this law. And those proceeds are not going to start coming in on Day One. It's going to take a while to come in. And so we have recommended in this report that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in -LRB- fiscal 1990 -RRB- appropriate $ 300 million to put the first money in the fund so we can start the process. And obviously, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refuses to appropriate enough money to get ... the process going, then it's going to be very difficult Q. It's often said that certain bases have remained open over the years for political or pork barrel reasons. Did you find any evidence of that in your study? And how far have you gone to eliminating it, if that's the case? RIBICOFF: I do n't think there was any influence or any attempt to protect pork barrel bases. I do n't think that was taken into account at all. I do n't think anybody on the commission felt any pressure. We looked at these bases seriously. We looked at all the figures. We spent a lot of time in discussion. Each and every base was voted on unanimously, with the action taken. EDWARDS: You should understand first that we simply did not start with a list. ... We started with a set of criteria which we applied to all 4,300 installations in this country. ... And we took those as we found them. Q. There are four states that are missing _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, all home states of the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Appropriations Committees. Were there no bases in those states worthy of closing? EDWARDS: That's certainly not by design. We did take a little something out of <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, I recall. I do n't believe we touched <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, I'm going to bet, does n't have a whole lot of military in the first place. ... We had to deal with bases where we found them. Q. Could you please elaborate on some of the personnel changes that are going to take place at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION> and some of the other bases that are getting increases of people? RIBICOFF: We found that certain missions were split between a number of bases _ they did n't make any sense _ when they should have been consolidated and put in one base. And what we did in many instances, we just do that, and especially when you talk about <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION>. ... You will find a shift from one fort to the other, one base to the other, which will make it more effective, more efficient, and be able to do a much better job with their mission. Q. I wonder if you had the opportunity to pass judgment on the value of strategic home porting, to see whether dispersion of ships offers protection in the nuclear age, or whether it's really just a way of building local political support for various naval tasks. EDWARDS: I do n't know anything that was discussed more than strategic home porting. ... We concluded that our job was not to deal with force structure. That's the military's job. ... Our job was to try to deal with that force structure as we found it, and try to accommodate it to the facilities that we were working with. And so we had to live with the fact that there's going to be a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Maybe there never will be ... but we do n't know that. So we had to look at the home ports with an idea where are you going to put that other 150 ships that are building up from the 450-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. And we concluded that we could justify some home ports, most of them. Q. If it were not for political constraints, could you actually ... expand your list? Are there a lot of other bases you consider still vulnerable or could be effectively closed? EDWARDS: The biggest constraint ... is the six-year payback constraint. We found a lot of facilities that had 10-year paybacks, 12-year paybacks, even 20-year paybacks, where we could have made some major savings over a longer period of time. But we were constrained by our charter, which had a six-year payback. RIBICOFF: Once you got over the six years, we had to stop. I think wisdom and better planning would have been more meaningful if we were n't stuck with that six-year payback. Q. In other words, some of these places survived because of their inefficiency? EDWARDS: No, I think it may cost a lot of money to move one facility into another base and have to build all-new construction, and your payback just simply wo n't make it.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today investigators were working on the assumption the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 was an act of terrorism rather than a nonpolitical crime. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> also said officials believe the case can be solved. `` We think that the chances are pretty good,'' she said. `` We ca n't be sure.'' As the probe of the Dec. 21 disaster moved into its second week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators were still unable to pinpoint guilt. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said they had no hard leads, no specifically incriminating evidence. But asked if the boming of the plane was an act of terrorism, in contrast to a simple criminal act, she said `` clearly most of us feel that it is more likely, but we are not sure.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official added: `` We really have to pursue all the avenues of the investigation to say with certainty that it was a terrorist activity.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said no new information had been received since Wednesday when she declined to say whether a terrorist was behind the bombing. `` We are all operating in that sense on the basis of assumptions of what seems likely,'' she said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, mystified how the bomb got aboard, began searching for possible security lapses by American airlines abroad and directed tighter screening of passengers and their baggage. Government officials acknowledged Wednesday that a week after the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet exploded over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing at least 270 people, there are no hard leads on who put the explosive device on the jet or where the deed was done. Shortly after it was confirmed Wednesday by British investigators that a bomb caused the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 to crash Dec. 21 on a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration promised `` all available assistance'' in investigating the bombing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said there was a wide range of terrorist groups that may have been responsible. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of counterterrorism, told reporters it was too early to focus suspicion on a particular group. `` We should n't narrow our field of inquiry until we get more evidence or intelligence that leads us in a certain direction. ... There is n't any prime suspect,'' he said. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said today on `` CBS This Morning'' that `` we have a very good chance'' of finding out who was responsible for the bombing but that `` we're a long way from those conclusions at this point.'' He said officials do n't yet know if it was a terrorist attack. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said it was `` reviewing current security measures'' being taken by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers abroad because of the bombing and said it was preparing `` more stringent security requirements which will afford additional protection to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers and the traveling public.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in a statement did not cite specific changes that are being directed at the airlines. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security experts are still working out details of the new requirements, some of which are likely not to be made public. Much of the focus is expected to be on tightening passengers screening, inspection of carry-on luggage and taking additional precautions to match all baggage with boarding passengers. `` In some cases it will be a matter of degree,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is responsible for establishing security requirements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad, although many security measures are imposed in cooperation with the other governments involved. While little evidence so far has been uncovered to indicate who might be responsible for the Pan Am bombing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said there are a number of potential suspects. They include radical Palestinians such as the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, and the pro-Libyan <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group, as well as an Iranian group, the Guardians of Islamic Revolution. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said among the tasks confronting investigators was to find out how the bomb got aboard Flight 103, where it was placed and what it was made of. It's not known whether the bomb eluded security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where Flight 103 originated as a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, or at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where the flight shifted to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 for the trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Senior <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged that they are perplexed by the bombing because both the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> airports are considered to be particularly security conscious and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had undertaken special security precautions because of a tip the airline might be a target of a terrorist bombing. According to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> these precautions by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> included having all checked bags go through X-ray, having all carry-on bags checked by hand, matching all checked luggage with boarding passengers and imposing special surveillance of caterers and others who might have access to the jetliner. The White House pledged `` all available resources'' to help the British investigation, including assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Sessions said that includes interviewing relatives and associates of passengers aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet to determine if a bomb might have been placed aboard the plane to target a specific passenger. Last week, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government offered a reward of up to $ 500,000 for information leading to the prosecution of any terrorist or saboteur who caused the crash. `` The incident points up the need for the international community to adopt even more stringent air security measures,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed with Finnish police in ruling out any connection between the crash and a Dec. 5 telephone call to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> from a person who said a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet would be the target of a bombing in December. That call had prompted an alert from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and caused <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> to increase security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, officials have said.

 Two Israeli helicopter gunships attacked with rockets and destroyed a base of the Shiite Moslem militia <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today. Police said eight people were wounded. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and killed three suspected infiltrators who crossed the border from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and mounted searches in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> for a fourth man who escaped, a military spokesman in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said today. The Israeli army said today's raid was conducted to eliminate an Amal base used by Palestinian guerrillas who raided northern <LOCATION> Isreal </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Lebanese police said the Israeli Cobra gunships struck at 8 a.m., today hitting a four-story hilltop building used as an Amal command post in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Salassel </LOCATION> near the village of <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, 9 -LCB- miles north of the Israeli border. `` The building took several direct rocket hits and was leveled,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations. The Israelis said the helicopters had returned safely. <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> is north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone and is the headquarters of the Irish battalion serving with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The air raid was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first on an <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> base since 1985, when the Israeli army pulled back and established the 8-to-10-mile-wide security zone three years after invading <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An Israeli military spokesman in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas had used the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> base for an attempt to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Wednesday. They were killed by Israeli troops at the border. The guerrillas belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a small leftist faction supported by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which also backs Amal. Amal members from the base assisted the Palestinian guerrillas in their attempt to sneak into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and attack an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> settlement on Wednesday, the Israeli army said. In the clash near the Egyptian border on Wednesday, it was not immediately clear if the infiltration involved guerrillas or, possibly, smugglers. The Israeli army said no identification papers or weapons were found on the three bodies. One military official said, however, that the possibility they were terrorists `` has not been ruled out.'' The last major infiltration from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was in March, when three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians before they were shot to death. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s Force 17 claimed responsibility. Soldiers first detected the infiltration Wednesday when they found footprints leading across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s southern border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, said a military spokesman, who can not be identified by name under army rules. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, said a group of armed Palestinians was trapped Wednesday night near the Jordanian border settlement of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahav </PERSON>. Unconfirmed reports said three members of the group were killed. However, an Israeli army spokesman, asked if there were two infiltrations, said: `` We have only the one we announced from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas are stepping up attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> partly because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and other Israeli leaders in their recent statements have not mentioned the deep divisions within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, apparently in part because terror attacks pinned on the group help discredit the diplomatic initiative of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, said earlier this month that he recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terror, and in return the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped its refusal to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

 Chinese officials said Thursday they probably would punish at least seven African students for a brawl with Chinese workers, students and teachers that set off days of anti-black demonstrations. They said no Chinese students would be punished for participating in the clash and subsequent demonstrations, or for sacking the rooms of some African students. `` We know who the Africans are that carried out the beating,'' said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiju </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where the clash took place. `` The African students did this in a planned way.'' But the Chinese students `` demonstrated out of anger. They did n't hurt anybody so none of them will be punished,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said in an interview About 140 African students, joined by about a dozen other foreign students, remained in isolation at a guest house about a 90-minute drive outside of this eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> city. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said the seven `` suspects'' were at the guest house. The students have been at the house since Monday night, when <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police forced them there from the <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> train station. The students wanted to travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because they fear for their safety. Officials said Thursday that all the students except the seven or eight Africans involved in the fracas could leave the guest house as long as they returned to their schools in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. Two Western reporters who went to the guest house Thursday were refused permission to speak with the students. Chinese officials at the <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> provincial foreign affairs office also refused to let reporters talk with the students. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinese </PERSON> took to the streets for the fifth straight day since Saturday, when 11 Chinese and two Africans were injured in the Hehai clash. A crowd of about 800, well below the figure on previous nights, gathered at <LOCATION> Gulou </LOCATION>, an old drum tower on a main <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> intersection. Some 600 later marched peacefully from there to the city center, escorted by hundreds of police. The students again called on the government to deal with the <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION> clash `` according to law.'' Earlier demonstrations on Sunday and Monday were markedly racist in tone, with youths chanting `` Down with black devils!'' and `` Black devils go home!'' Some Chinese students also protested preferential conditions given to foreign students. On Wednesday night, riot police wielding clubs charged a crowd of thousands. Officers hit youths and drove some off in unmarked vans. Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, the city's main paper, called for peace in the streets. The front-page editorial also called for Chinese to be friendly to foreigners. In the interview, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> claimed the African students at <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION> planned the bloodshed. He said the Africans started the fight because they were unhappy about a wall that was being built around their two dormitories at the university. If the wall was erected, he said, the Africans `` could n't play with girls freely.'' He also accused the African students of consorting with prostitutes. African students, mostly men who spend up to six years in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, say their social contacts with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women frequently are the catalyst for racial confrontations. Although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has close relations with most black African states, deep-seated prejudices against blacks are common among Chinese, they say. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, division chief of the <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> provincial foreign affairs office in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, said no arrests have been made so far. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> stressed at a weekly news briefing that `` the incident that has occurred in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> is an isolated one having nothing to do with racial discrimination.'' He said charges the Africans are being illegally held were `` groundless.'' On Thursday, the only African student to leave the guest house and return to <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> said he was afraid for his life and wanted to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as soon as possible. `` I am very fearful,'' said a 23-year-old from the <LOCATION> Comoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. `` I wo n't leave this building. Even seeing a Chinese outside the window makes me cold with fright,'' said the student, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Bourhane </PERSON> and spoke in an interview at <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. At the guest house, located at a chemical fiber factory northwest of the city, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials refused to let two Western reporters talk with the students.

<TEXT>
 The government rolled back huge price increases Thursday after a general strike cut off communications, shut down a main airport and seaport and virtually paralyzed major cities, reports said. Police fired on anti-government demonstrators in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> who continued to press for greater reforms after hearing that the government had agreed to cut prices, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> transmitted a report from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> that said `` intensified'' shooting flared up shortly after dark, `` especially near the headquarters of the council of ministers.'' There was no word on casualties in either incident, the first reported violence in three days of protests in this financially strapped northeast African country. The demonstrators who were fired on reportedly were demanding that in addition to the economic concessions, the government work toward cementing a tentative plan to end a 5 -LCB- - year civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> The peace pact was negotiated by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, leader of the rebel forces, and the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The party, junior partner in the ruling coalition, dominates the 2 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which organized Thursday's general strike. The party announced on Wednesday it was resigning from the government in sympathy with the strikers. The reported price rollback was decided in an emergency cabinet session chaired by Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>. It canceled increases imposed Monday of 600 percent for sugar and 50 percent for cigarettes and a 15 percent sales tax for all commodities. A statement reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed salary increases of up to 500 percent that the government had decreed on Saturday. It also said people immediately could buy sugar at old prices and that subsidies would be applied to sorghum, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s staple food. The government's had said he it needed the price increases to finance the salary increases and subsidy program. The Egyptian agency also quoted <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, the information minister, as saying work would begin `` in the coming hours'' on forming a new government in light of the Democratic Unionists' pullout. The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Information Minister <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, the government's chief spokesman, as promising immediate steps to form a new Cabinet. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> presumably meant Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> would keep his post, since his <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has the largest number of parliamentary seats. Meanwhile, Sudanese newspapers and the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported many of the country's major cities were at a standstill Thursday. Communications were cut at midmorning, the time designated for the strike, apparently the result of telecommunications workers walking off their jobs. Coupled with the shutdown of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> International Airport and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, the country's main <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> was virtually isolated. Aircraft that normally fly over <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> were being rerouted because of the lack of radio contact with <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> air traffic controllers. The trouble is similar to widespread unrest over high prices that brought down former dictator <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> in 1985 after 16 years in power. Then, however, powerful professional associations of doctors and lawyers were in the forefront rather than workers and students leading the current protests.

<HEAD>Boy's Hair Dispute Nets Fine For Father</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man who refused to force his son to cut his hair to bring the teen-ager into compliance with a high school's grooming code has been convicted of violating the state's compulsory school attendance law. Jurors deliberated about 45 minutes Wednesday before convicting <PERSON> Dub </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> of the misdemeanor and fining him $ 25, the maximum. With court costs, <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, 48, will have to pay $ 100. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, who said he will appeal, was found guilty of not requiring his 14-year-old son <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> to attend <ORGANIZATION> Northbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, 16, have not attended class since Oct. 28, when they were barred for failing to adhere to the school district's dress code, which prohibits boys from having hair that falls below their shoulders. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> had said it was his sons' right to wear their hair the way they wanted. His position remained unchanged after the verdict. `` I will not ask my sons to cut their hair. That is their decision,'' he said. `` My dad would n't keep me from school,'' <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I love him.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' compulsory attendance law only applies through the academic year a student turns 16, so <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s non-attendance was not part of the charges against his father. During the two-day trial, <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> McAlexander </PERSON>, argued that the hair-length rule is enforced selectively. He also questioned its purpose and said it held the potential for sexual discrimination. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlow </PERSON> said the verdict is a reminder to students that the school `` is not a Burger King _ <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> ca n't go there and demand he have it his own way.'' District Superintendent <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the boys still must cut their hair before they are admitted to class.

 When it comes to pronouncing the name of this tiny community, the official ruling is hold the `` MAY-o.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> _ which includes the hamlet of <LOCATION> Mahopac </LOCATION> _ has ruled that the proper pronunciation is Mah-HO-pak, rather than MAY-o-pak. The vote Tuesday night was 3-2, reflecting the division on the long-debated issue in this community about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Othmer </PERSON> said that in his experience _ which includes going door-to-door in the past 10 elections _ half the residents call the community Mah-HO-pak and half said MAY-o-pak.

 The government has filed a lawsuit seeking to void the 1987 re-election of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> secretary-treasurer <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> as president of his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> local, saying the voting may have been rigged. The lawsuit, filed in federal court Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to invalidate <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>' re-election as president of Local 728 and the election of his son, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and other local officers. It also asks that a new election be conducted under federal supervision. The elder <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, general secretary-treasurer of the 1.3-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, lost his bid to succeed <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president in July. The lawsuit would not affect his position in the international. He resigned as Local 728 president in June after 21 years on the job and created Local 928. He then transferred more than half of <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 728 </ORGANIZATION>'s 8,000 members to the new local and appointed his son to head it. Another son and a nice also joined Local 728, the son as business agent. Two groups of candidates who ran against the <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> slate in 1987 filed petitions with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> this year challenging the election. They also accused the elder <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> of forming the new local to protect his relatives' jobs if he lost his re-election bid. If a federal judge grants the government's request, Local 728 officers appointed by the elder <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> must stand for re-election. `` It's long overdue that we get a fair election,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who ran against <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> in the disputed election.

<TEXT>
 The decision to close <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, a 119-acre Army installation built in 1862 to protect stagecoach routes from Indians and keep an eye on Mormon settlers, came as little surprise Thursday. The once-strategic post in the <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> foothills east of downtown <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had long been criticized in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as contributing little to national defense. The government commission that put the fort on a list of installations to be shut down or scaled back estimated that closing <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> _ a collection of parade grounds, barracks and other brick and whitewashed buildings, some dating from the 1920s and 1930s _ would save $ 1.4 million over 20 years. Members of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> congressional delegation expressed conditional support for the decision. The commission called for the reassignment of most of the fort's 640 full-time employees to other <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> military installations. Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, a Democrat whose district the fort is in, `` wo n't stand in the way if the decision was arrived at fairly, and if indeed it will save more money than it costs to implement,'' said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' spokesman Art Kingdom. Kingdom said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> would introduce legislation to turn over the property to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, also said he would propose such a bill. `` I'm sure there's going to be people disappointed who work here,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Auer </PERSON>, fort spokesman. `` One of the things we have to contend with is 44 of our buildings here are also registered national historic landmarks. `` Some of these buildings are quarters that military personnel live in,'' he added. `` Personally, at this point, we're kind of curious as to what and how they're going to do this.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said he would support the fort's closing if convinced it is a cost-effective move for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He said he understood the installation's historic sites and buildings will be preserved. `` I am pleased that the proposed impact on <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is minimal, because it is a clear affirmation of the efficiency and value of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s military installations and personnel and the contribution they make to our national security,'' <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said he understood only 77 civilian jobs will be lost as a result. While <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has no plans for the land and buildings, Mayor <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> DePauli </PERSON> believes it would `` be perfect for an Olympic village'' if the city succeeds in its bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics, said chief of staff <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuhl </PERSON>. While officially built as an Indian post, the fort's first commander, Col. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, acknowledged that he chose the foothills overlooking <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> so he could keep an eye on <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>'s polygamy-practicing Mormon pioneers. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> referred to the settlers, who had arrived in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in 1847, as `` a community of traitors, murderers, fanatics and whores'' who also were too friendly with the Indians. Tensions ran so high that when troops fired the fort's cannon to salute <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>'s promotion to general in 1863, the Mormons assumed it was an attack. A thousand or more Mormon `` minutemen'' quickly assembled to protect the city, but hostilities were avoided. Relations between the government and Mormons were strained when <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> tried to force merchants to take an oath of loyalty to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a condition of selling goods at the fort. The crisis abated after <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s departure. The church dropped polygamy in 1890, and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> became a state in 1896. From that point, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and city got along well. In modern times the fort's personnel have been assigned a variety of missions. The base gives logistic and administrative support primarily to reserve units, but also active units, in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. It also is headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> recruiting efforts in the region and is the reserve pay office for 14 states. More than 2,300 reservists with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> train at the fort each year.

<TEXT>
 The government has refused to grant automatic resident status to 85,000 people living in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> who claim to be refugees, immigration officials said. The government instead will begin screening each case after Jan. 1, with some deportations virtually assured, said Immigration Minister <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON>, `` I want to state categorically that removals will take place,'' she said. `` Many people came here making refugee claims to circumvent our immigration laws. ... We must restore integrity to our refugee and immigration system.'' She declined at a news conference on Wednesday to estimate how many of the 85,000 claims pending will be accepted under a two-year screening program expected to cost $ 83 million. The announcement of the screening program drew criticism from some quarters. `` No one wants to reward refugee scam artists or the blatant queue-jumpers who take the place of legitimate applicants,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. `` But to show little compassion for those thousands who have been here for months seems hard-hearted at the very least.'' The Star, which frequently criticizes Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Progressive Conservative government, asked if this could be the same <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that `` demonstrated its compassion to the world'' in 1979 by accepting more than 75,000 Vietnamese boat people. But the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> praised the decision. `` Deporting the phony refugees is the only fair way to handle those who try to jump the queue ahead of those who have been waiting for years, some of them to be reunited with their families.'' Officials said humanitarian or compassionate grounds will be considered before any deportation. Although activists believe the program could threaten people genuinely seeking refuge in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, others say many of the immigrants are seeking economic improvements and not political safety. The program will send each of the 85,000 people claiming refugee status before government panels, each with two members. A decision by any one member of the panel that political, religious or other reasons threaten the claimant's safety is enough to clear the way to immigrant status. The special program was needed only for the backlog because a new system is intended to reject false refugee claims upon arrival in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. A limited amnesty was declared in May 1986 for about 22,000 people who were then claiming refugee status, granting residency to all who already had jobs or family in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and no criminal record. The backlog of refugee claims has increased steadily from 6,500 in 1984 to the current level, which would take five to seven years to clear under the present system. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shefman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said in a phone interview there was cautious optimism that the refugee claimants will get `` fair and quick hearings.'' He said the organization was relieved that the claimants will be able to work while awaiting a decision. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest country in territory, has a population of 26 million. It traditionally has encouraged immigration, and the government has raised its target from 125,000 to 135,000 in 1988 to 150,000 to 160,000 next year.

 Israeli soldiers shot and killed three infiltrators who crossed the border from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and mounted searches Thursday in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> for a fourth man who escaped, a military spokesman said. It was not immediately clear if the infiltration Wednesday involved guerrillas or possibly smugglers. The army withheld reports of the incident until Thursday, apparently to prevent panic among the public. An army spokesman said no identification papers or weapons were found on the bodies. One military official said, however, that the possibility they were terrorists `` has not been ruled out.'' The infiltration came on the heels of three attempts earlier this week by Palestinian guerrillas to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine guerrillas were killed in those attacks, which were seen as attempts by dissident Syrian-backed groups to disrupt the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Speaking to reporters, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision earlier this month to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> had created a climate for increased attacks. `` It is a fact that the latest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> decision to have talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has encouraged the tendency of violent acts against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. The last major infiltration from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was in March, when three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians before they were shot to death. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s Force 17 claimed responsibility. Soldiers first detected the infiltration Wednesday when they found footprints leading across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s southern border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, said a military spokesman, who can not be identified by name under army rules. He said troops followed the tracks to a small truck south of the town of <LOCATION> Mitzpe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION>, 10 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The soldiers opened fire when the driver ignored an order to stop and killed three men. A fourth escaped, he said. Military helicopters circled above the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert Thursday as searches for the missing man continued, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said. State radio said the resort town of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Mitzpe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION>, was cut off from the rest of the country for most of the day after the army closed the road for its searches. On Monday, Israeli troops killed three suspected Palestinian guerrillas not far from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Three more guerrillas were killed in the same area on Wednesday. Also Monday, three guerrillas drowned when their boat capsized off the coast of southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as they made their way to the northern Israeli coast. The army spokesman denied rumors that two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were injured in the gunfight.

 Soviet scientists have recommended a Siberian radar station that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says violates the Antiballistic Missile Treaty be turned into an ecological center, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> previously offered to turn over the giant, phased-array radar in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> to a civilian agency, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had rejected anything short of dismantling the station. Disputes over the observance of the 1972 ABM Treaty are among the differences that have stymied superpower negotiations on a treaty to halve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals of long-range, offensive nuclear weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> suggested that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar center would make a good international ecological center because its equipment is capable of closely measuring atmospheric processes caused by air pollution, the official radio said. On Sept. 27, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> the radar should become part of an international space organization. He did not specifically say it would be dismantled. He also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radars in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should be converted. The Kremlin announced in October that it was giving the station, which is in central <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said it would be turned over to international space study. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said the move was unsatisfactory because it did not include the complete dismantling of the radar. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the plant violates provisions of the ABM treaty that specify that radar stations capable of giving advanced warnings of missile attacks may only be located on the periphery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Soviet territory.

<HEAD>Panel Proposes Closing 34 Military Installations; Approval Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government commission called Thursday for closing 34 military installations, including five major <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest basic training site, in a recommendation that could send economic shock waves to communities across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In addition, the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure recommended closing 52 military housing units in 13 states that date back to the construction of <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> missile bases in the 1950s, and partially closing five military facilities and changing the mission _ and the manpower levels _ at 54 other facilities. The panel's recommendations appeared to have a good chance of taking effect. If <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> approves them, as expected, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to reject the whole list in order to save any of the facilities. And even such a resolution of disapproval could be vetoed by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after he moves into the White House on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who has strongly supported the work of the bipartisan commission, has until Jan. 15 _ five days before leaving office _ to either accept or reject the entire list. The first overhaul in 11 years of the nation's web of 3,800 military installations could save an estimated $ 693 million a year without hindering the national security, said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and co-chairman of the panel. The $ 693 million savings is minuscule when compared with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s annual budget of $ 300 billion. The states hit hardest by the panel's recommendations were <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which would lose five major installations; and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which would lose two. The area of the nation faring best was the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, which would n't lose any major facilities. The five <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases recommended for closure include <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Their missions would be shifted to other bases. Also closed would be the Presidio, a major <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> administrative base in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a facility built in 1862 to protect Pony Express riders from Indians. It has often been cited as a prime example of unneeded bases. The five bases that would be partially shut down include <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where 33,490 recruits underwent basic training in the year that ended Sept. 30. Only <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, trains more recruits. Fort Dix would go on semi-active status at a loss of 4,686 military and civilian jobs. Fifty-four other bases should be realigned, meaning they would either gain or lose personnel, the commission said. Also closed would be part of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, Md.; and the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has long wanted to shut down. The panel called for halting construction at three sites where the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wanted to built new ports for its growing fleet of ships and closing the sites. They are the Hunters Point Naval Station in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Naval Station; and the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, Naval Station. The early reaction from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was generally positive. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the odds are heavily in favor'' of the list becoming law `` My general feeling is this will be well received by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s state would not lose any major bases. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed `` I think the recommendation will make it all the way through,'' he said. But Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, both <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, noted their state is losing <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the Army's <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> They complained that overseas bases should be closed before any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities are mothballed. <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> and panel co-chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, predicted some legislators would be unhappy but said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is n't likely to overturn the decision. Legislators with bases on the reduction list are `` going to be unhappy and we understand that,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` But we feel like the majority of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will support what we have done.'' Local communities will be unhappy, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` Of course, they will have a hard time swallowing'' the decision. In some communities, a military base provides a source of employment and a sure source of income in good times and bad. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he was sympathetic with communities that would lose facilities because an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base closed in his district 25 years ago, costing 14,000 jobs. `` I certainly understand the impact,'' he said. Closed bases mean lost jobs and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has refused to permit any major closures since 1977, when the first of a thicket of rules and regulations was enacted to make it hard for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to pare down the installation list. The 12-member panel was created this year as a way to circumvent such congressional roadblocks and there were predictions the annual savings might be as high as $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion. The savings estimate provided by the commission `` does fall short of the savings estimates which many had predicted,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, executive director of the panel, said those early estimates `` were just pulled out of the air.'' The panel, working in strict secrecy, considered a number of factors, including military utility and whether a base's functions could be better carried out at another location. Another requirement was that the one-time costs of closing a base, such as severance pay and waste clean-up, would be offset within six years by the money that would be saved. `` Our report represents an opportunity to reduce training costs in terms of manpower, overhead costs and fuel, to improve command and control, consolidate training and improve economies of scale and to remove unnecessary administrative burdens to our defense managers,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. Two installations _ <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> _ escaped even though they have long been included on critics' lists of unneeded bases It was the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to close Loring in 1977 which prompted the congressional roadblocks to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s base realignment efforts. <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was originally built with a moat to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from British attack in the War of 1812. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> escaped the ax because they have developed new uses in recent years, meaning they did n't met the commission's complicated set of criteria for closing a base. While some of the 34 bases that would be closed are major installations with big payrolls, others are far smaller installations. The latter include such places as <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wingate </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> site where the Army stores ammunition and which employs only 92 people; the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tacony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which employs only 29 people and is used only as a training center for reservists.

 The law and order minister Thursday banned four anti-apartheid groups, using state-of-emergency regulations that have shut down 28 other organizations this year. Two of the latest targets were teachers' unions and a third was a student group that coordinated anti-government protests this year in mixed-race townships near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The fourth banned group was the National Detainees Forum, established in July to carry on monitoring work that had been conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Detainees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> before its banning in February. Both watchdog groups have played a major role in providing information on the thousands of activists, most of them black, detained without charge for varying periods during the 30-month-old state of emergency. A statement issued on behalf of Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said the predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the predominantly mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> had promoted `` people's education'' _ an effort by non-white communities to exert greater control over curriculum in their schools. A year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister for black education, <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, said the government saw important positive elements in people's education. But Lt. <PERSON> Peet </PERSON> <PERSON> Bothma </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, said Thursday that the concept was inspired by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. The two teachers' unions, both founded in 1985, were `` politicizing education and discrediting the education system,'' said <PERSON> Bothma </PERSON>. `` Both are involved in the broad revolutionary onslaught against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which could escalate into strikes, boycotts, terror and unrest incidents.'' <PERSON> Bothma </PERSON> said the government had similar concerns about the predominantly mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, one of a dozen youth and student groups banned this year. Thousands of mixed-race students around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, in some cases supported by faculty, staged a widespread classroom boycott in April to protest detentions and harassment of students and teachers. The latest bannings were denounced by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. It described the government as `` power-drunk'' and said that only 24 organizations had been banned in a 37-year period before 1988. The newly banned organizations `` have never been accused in court of any illegal actions,'' the commission said in a statement. `` Their bannings are a result of their steadfast opposition to apartheid policies.'' The 17 groups affected by the initial banning orders in February included the largest anti-apartheid coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and a nationwide black-consciousness group, the <ORGANIZATION> Azanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The main anti-apartheid labor federation, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, was prohibited from political activity as part of the crackdown, although it has not muted its criticism of the government. But much of the above-ground leadership of the anti-apartheid movement has shifted to an alliance of clergymen, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of Reformed Churches. The country's main mixed-race political party Thursday ended its annual conference with a pledge to seek contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> delegates rejected a proposal to quit <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as a protest against apartheid, but resolved to take more initiative in working with non-parliamentary groups to undermine the white government's racial policies. Parliament has chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixed race, but the black majority is excluded.

 Police said Thursday they have located five more cattle ranchers who may be linked to the slaying of a prominent ecologist who fought to protect the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> forest. Three other cattlemen already have been arrested in the death of <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, 44, who was gunned down Dec. 22 outside his home about 50 miles outside of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. About 80 officers from <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> were transferred Wednesday to the western <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> state of Acre to search the jungles for suspects in the death, said Deputy Justice Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON>. `` Overnight, the police located five ranchers who may be suspects in the <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> case but nothing has been confirmed,'' <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON> said. He gave no further details. <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON>, contacted by telephone in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, refused to confirm press reports that said five suspects _ all cattle ranchers _ had been arrested by police on a ranch near the jungle village of <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was slain. <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION> is about 2,600 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. Police already were holding in custody three sons of <PERSON> Darly </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a cattle rancher who <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> had said sent him death threats. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> led a local rubber tappers union that fought against clearing the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> for cattle grazing. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> last year received a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Global 500 prize given to top ecologists worldwide. <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON> said police had found several clues indicating that <PERSON> Oloci </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, captured Tuesday after a gun battle on the family ranch in <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, was at the scene of the Mendes shooting. `` The police have analyzed several cigarette butts found in front of <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>' house, and <PERSON> Oloci </PERSON> is known to have smoked the same brand,'' said the Justice Minisitry official. `` This and other clues lead us to believe he was present when <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was killed.'' Also being held were 21-year-old <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, who claims to have killed <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, and his brother <PERSON> Aleci </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>. Police have said they doubt <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> participated in <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>' slaying and that he is being used as a decoy by his father, whose whereabouts is unknown <PERSON> Eichenburg </PERSON> said the police would extend `` possibly throughout the month of January'' a `` sweep operation,'' begun Wednesday to find and confiscate illegal weapons in the region in a push to halt land-dispute violence in the western <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. For the second day, police flew over the jungle in helicopters and search planes. They set up road blocks along highways and the state's border with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in the search for <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> and any unregistered weapons. `` The atmosphere in Acre is extremely tense and it is up to the police to control any further outbreaks of violence,'' said <PERSON> Eichenburg </PERSON>. The battles over the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, an expanse of rainforest about two-thirds the size of continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has often erupted in bloody clashes. Cattle ranchers, eager to clear forest lands for grazing, often order the killings of squatters and ecologists who oppose them.

<HEAD>Agriculture Department To Establish Offices At Black Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will establish offices at each of 17 historically black universities to help encourage more minorities to enter agriculture and forestry. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the offices will be `` a focal point for all <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> activities'' at the universities, collectively known as 1890 institutions because of land-grant college legislation that year. A few department agencies have offices at some of those schools, but <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said this will be the first time that there will be an on-campus link between <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and each of the universities. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the offices will help with curriculum development, recruit and counsel students on employment opportunities in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, and develop new ideas and approaches to help small-scale, limited-resource and minority farmers. `` From international trade to the revitalization of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, there are numerous career opportunities in agriculture and forestry,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is strengthening its ties to the 1890 institution to ensure that minority youth know of those opportunities and are encouraged to seek out careers in agriculture.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is recruiting among current employees for the liaison offices and expects to have all positions filled by April.

<HEAD>Talks Blocked By North Korea's Demand On U.S.-South Korean
Maneuvers</HEAD>

 Talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on easing tension suffered a sharp setback Thursday when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded an end to U.S.-South Korean military exercises. The five-member delegations of both sides agreed to meet again Feb. 10 at this truce village inside the Demilitarized Zone seprating the two nations. The three-hour meeting plunged into stalemate a few minutes after it opened when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> issued a new demand for an end to annual <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` Team Spirit'' exercises it says threaten its security. The chief North Korean delegate, <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul </PERSON>, said this was a precondition for the parliamentary talks and other proposals for inter-Korea contacts. `` Team Sprit war exercises have created a state of quasi-war and affected South-North talks in progress. The exercises have been the biggest obstacle blocking the progress of dialogue,'' <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> said. His South Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mun-shick </PERSON>, accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of laying a new obstacle before the talks and insisted the issue be addressed at other government-level talks expected early next year. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> rejected the idea. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hold annual spring military exercises to practice their joint command system in the event of a North Korean invasion. About 200,000 troops of both sides took part in last year's exercises from February to April. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had hoped before Thursday's meeting, the seventh since August, that agreement was near on setting terms for full-scale talks between each side's legislatures after making progress at a Nov. 17 meeting. <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> expressed `` surprise and suspicion'' at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s new demand and asked that it be dropped, saying the exercises are annual and defensive. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand is very disappointing. I suspect that their resolve to make the talks a success has weakened,'' <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> said after the meeting. <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> declined to withdraw the demand and suggested the military exercises could be an obstacle to the parliamentary talks and proposals for separate government and sports talks. Rep. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwan-yong </PERSON>, an opposition member on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation, said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> used the same tactics three years ago. Park, a member of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> negotiating team in talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1985, said lawmakers of both sides were close to agreement and scheduled to meet in mid-February in 1986. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> unilaterally suspended all dialogue to protest the `` Team Spirit'' exercises. The meeting was held the day after <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> sent a message to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agreeing to separate political and military talks on arms reductions and other tension-easing measures. Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> wrote his North Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Yon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung </PERSON> <PERSON> Muk </PERSON>, that they head delegations to alternating talks in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> to discuss non-interference, cooperation in select areas and building `` mutual trust in military matters.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has yet to respond to three more North Korean proposals for political, military and sports talks. One proposal seeks the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed here under a mutual defense treaty. Talks have been held on and off since the early 1970s with little progress. Both sides have tended to stress their respective initiatives and play down the other's proposals. The two Koreas have hundreds of thousands of troops facing each other along the 150-mile border. The border is sealed and there are no communications except for a hot line. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces divided the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula when they ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II in 1945. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<HEAD>FCC Warns of Misuse of Emergency Aircraft Locators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning Thursday about the unauthorized use of emergency locator transmitters used to aid in the search and rescue of downed or disabled aircraft. The warning was directed at users of emergency personal locators, for which `` misleading advertisements'' imply that these devices are authorized for use by backpackers and hikers to alert search and rescue personnel, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. Emergency locator transmitters are authorized for use only by aircraft in distress or in an aeronautical emergency. Their use for any other purpose is prohibited because it would jeopardize the effectiveness of the transmitters in aeronautical search and rescue operations, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. The frequencies allocated to emergency locator transmitters `` can not accommodate an additional large number of personal users such as backpackers and hikers,'' the commission said in its warning. The penalty for unauthorized use of these transmitters includes fines up to $ 10,000 and possible imprisonment, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said ads for emergency personal locators have appeared in sales catalogs, but it did not identify the publications. Officials at the agency said they did not know whether unauthorized use of these transmitters has hampered any aeronautical search and rescue operations.

<TEXT>
 Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said in a rare interview with a <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that his controversial plan to raze 7,000 villages is needed to modernize the countryside. In a related development, a Frankfurt-based human rights organization said Romanian border police this year have killed at least 400 Romanians, many of Hungarian or German descent, trying to flee to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Among the villages to be razed under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s plan are most of those where ethnic Hungarians or Germans form a majority of the local population. The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said the autocratic <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ruler spoke in a recent interview in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s capital Die Welt released excerpts of the interview to news agencies before its publication Friday. `` Our villages should systematically take on a new appearance,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Romanians in the third millenium must belong to a nation with a higher living standard enjoyed by each citizen in equal measure.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> last spring revealed plans for destroying about 7,000 of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 13,000 villages and resettling residents in housing complexes attached to agro-industrial centers. The plan is aimed at providing more farmland and at modernizing the agricultural industry, but it has drawn criticism from East and West. Foreign critics, including former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Funderburk </PERSON>, contend <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> is trying to wipe out the vestiges of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s capitalist and religious past. Last month, the Romanian leader appeared to back down somewhat from his announcement the villages would `` disappear'' under his resettlement plan. He said at the time that some communes in rural <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> would be preserved to avoid depopulating the countryside. In the Die Welt interview, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> reiterated that those who want to stay in their village homes will be allowed to. But he contended that a systematic consolidation of rural residents into agricultural centers is necessary to improve living conditions, transport and labor productivity. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has said the relocation project should be completed by 2000. So far, only scattered villages near the capital, <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, have been razed, but the policy has caused widespread disruption in the countryside and disturbed relations with foreign countries, particularly allied <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said Thursday that the Romanian-Yugoslavian border is `` the bloodiest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Romanians have attempted to flee the country in droves, and at least 400 have been shot and killed by Romanian border police in the past year, the private human rights group said in a dispatch to news media. It said an even larger number of Romanians drowned while trying to escape by swimming the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION>, which borders the two countries, but it did not give a figure. The society said many of those who succeeded in reaching <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> were sent back to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, unless the refugees managed to contact <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> authorities in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the commander of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s border guards said 6,974 Romanians have tried to cross illegally into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this year, a four-fold increase over last year. But the commander, <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Szekely </PERSON>, disputed reports that hundreds of Romanians attempting to flee to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were shot and killed by Romanian border guards. An estimated 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have found refuge in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which in January took the unprecedented step of accepting refugees from a fellow <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country. <PERSON> Szekely </PERSON> said 1,400 Romanians who fled illegally into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were returned to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, but he said they were `` undesirables'' such as common criminals, vagrants and teen-age delinquents. Die Welt also quoted <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> as rejecting the reforms of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a model for other socialist nations. `` There is no model, no stencil, for development in the socialist world,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Each nation must differentiate itself in this way.'' The newspaper said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> also rejected suggestions that his efforts to pay off foreign loans have harshly affected living conditions in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, including widespread shortages of power, food and consumer goods. He acknowledged `` a few difficulties,'' but he said the government has brought prices under control and expects a stable energy situation in two years.

 Passengers traveling on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines were questioned about their luggage and had their bags X-rayed Thursday in a security clampdown at British airports prompted by the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. The disclosure that plastic explosives blew up the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people and 11 on the ground, set off a worldwide hunt for the perpetrators. The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary called for the cooperation of governments in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where Palestinian and Iranian extremists are key suspects. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would `` severely punish'' the bombers if they were found. At <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s four airports that handle <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers, passengers fed their checked luggage through X-ray machines and were asked about who packed their bags, when they were packed, whether the bags had been out of their sight since, and whether strangers gave them parcels to carry. The X-rayed suitcases were bound in a tough plastic strip to prevent them from being opened between the check-in desks and the plane. Anything arousing suspicion was opened and searched by hand. At <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'s busy Terminal 3, used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, police patrolled with submachine guns issued to them after 1986 terrorist incidents in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Sure there's a risk, but you've got more chance of getting killed on a street in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischacker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> college professor rushing to catch a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said he flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on vacation the day after the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crashed into the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, and `` I was worried then.'' Gesturing to the X-ray machine, he said: `` What worries me a lot too is that they did n't have all this then.'' As he spoke, he drifted a few feet away from his bags and was promptly upbraided by ground staff for leaving them unattended. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> ordered the four British airports handling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers to step up security. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Auerbach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s chief in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said the airline had met `` all the requirements set by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>.'' He refused to elaborate. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, police said security was heightened at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION> airports, with undisclosed measures for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. Officials at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> da Vinci airport also said they had increased security. The British directive took effect a few hours after Wednesday's disclosure that a bomb blew Flight 103 out of the sky The directive was aimed at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, neighboring <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prestwick </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Amid a now familiar debate about what else can be done to protect airlines from terrorists, analysts speculated that the bomb could have been smuggled aboard in a suitcase, or into the cargo hold by ground staff. Many looked to <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national carrier, which has had long experience fighting terrorism and hand-searches all baggage. British lawmaker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilshire </PERSON>, whose constituency includes <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> also puts freight through simulated pressure procedures, so that any bomb set to be detonated by altitude changes would explode on the ground. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terrorism consultant, said key tasks for the investigators were to check the background of every passenger on Flight 103 and look for false identities; to discover whether any had connections that could make them `` witting or unwitting'' accomplices; and to trace every item of cargo back to its origins. The investigation involves Scottish police, the British anti-terrorism squad, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and West German federal police. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> asked for the cooperation of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> governments. `` This may well be a long, painstaking, structured matter,'' warned Detective Chief Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> area police, who is heading the criminal investigation. Police officers flew to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Thursday as part of the investigation, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. He said officers also would be sent to `` other parts of the world.'' He declined to elaborate. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has offered a $ 500,000 reward for information leading to those responsible for the crash. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked for his reaction to the air tragedy, said Thursday: `` Well, horror. And seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did this, if you could ever find them.'' But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was unlikely to retaliate if the killers were identified. `` I do n't know of any contingency plans that involve some form of retaliation on our part and I ca n't imagine that it is very likely,'' Price told reporters at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> before boarding a British Airways Concorde jet en route to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for New Year's. He said he would return to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> Jan. 4 to attend a memorial service for the victims. In a field outside a church in the countryside near <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, engineers sawed up the plane's nose section for removal. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, the brother of co-pilot <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, visited the church and asked for and was given two Bibles as mementos for the family, said the minister, the Rev. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. Relatives laid wreaths by the cockpit, while in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, a crane lifted one of the engines out of the 15-foot-deep crater in which it had lain for eight days. So far, 241 bodies have been found but only 16 have been identified and released for burial. Six Americans and a Briton were identified Thursday. They are the plane's pilot, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> MacQuarrie </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, co-pilot <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Pennington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Melina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Woodmere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlicote </PERSON>, 22, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Elyse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Saraceni </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Stays Out Of Dispute Over Communist Student Government Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge Thursday declined to get involved in a dispute over the election of a communist student body leader at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, saying the students and university should resolve the matter. The student, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, was elected co-president of the student government last spring with <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON>, a self-described progressive. But they had been barred from taking office by a student judicial body on the ground that the student constitution prohibited co-presidents. <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON> contended they were barred because of their political beliefs, and they asked <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Porada </PERSON> to issue an injunction assuring their right to take office. In turning down the request, <PERSON> Porada </PERSON> wrote that the matter is `` best left to the decision of the students, student senate and university judiciary without the intervention by the courts or trustees of the university.'' The judge also said an injunction was unnecessary because the school's <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had recently lifted its own ban against the two students taking office. The students' election still must be ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Etheredge </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON>, said the students were away for the holidays but that he had expected the judge's decision. He added that because of the recent ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, his clients had moved back into their offices. `` The issue now is whether the university pays <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> their back compensation and attorney's fees. If they do n't, we'll be back in court,'' he said. University attorney <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON> was reported to be out of his office Thursday afternoon and could not be reached for comment. Running as a team, <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> _ a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> _ and <LOCATION> Silkoff </LOCATION> were elected in March by 1,454 votes, a 361-vote margin over a conservative candidate at the 19,000-undergraduate school. A month after the election, the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> barred the two from the post. The presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is a paid position with the power to hire and appoint other students to the government body. <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON> argued that bylaws allow for co-presidents, and that the student judicial tribunal consisted of conservatives hand-picked by a student attorney general, who was chief among their political foes. The Civil Liberties Union of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> sued on their behalf, alleging that their civil rights were violated by campus conservatives intent on keeping them from office.

 Leaders of the military committees in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday they like the base-closing recommendations made by a special commission and predicted the proposals will be accepted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have a positive reaction,'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference `` This process is a step forward. ...

Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters he supports the plan and will urge colleagues to do likewise <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said his only criticism was that the commission's report was `` too modest'' and that the list of targeted bases could have been up to about 30 percent larger. He did not specify what other bases could have been included. `` This is a good start,'' said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary who is the ranking <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s committee He said the commission's report `` confirmed that there are inefficient aspects of our defense budget.'' The three lawmakers said they believe the panel's recommendations to close 86 installations and reduce or alter operations at 59 others will be accepted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which would face an all-or-nothing decision once the report reaches <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> after a review by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` My general feeling is this will be well received by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` The odds are heavily in favor of this becoming the law of the land.'' <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> told reporters he believes `` the recommendation will make it all the way through'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which created the commission this year to break the impasse that has prevented lawmakers from agreeing on any major closings since 1977. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said budget deficits require the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to look toward further base closings and consolidations to generate more economies than the $ 693 million a year the commission says its plan would save. `` I think this ought to be a continuous source of study by the new -LRB- defense -RRB- secretary,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who wants overseas basis included in such a review. `` There's still a way to go in terms of a complete review based on the new budget circumstances.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, R-Calif., said his initial reaction to the plan was positive <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> is the ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction, which would have the initial House say on financing the closure plan. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> represents <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, which would be a winner under the plan, gaining five <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships, 1,473 military personnel and 22 civilian jobs _ all of which had been slated for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` There is no question in these tight budgetary times we are going to have to do more with less,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said in a statement. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., one of the principal authors of the law that created the commission, said the recommendations are `` a crucial step towards achieving real savings for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> had no bases on ths hit list. But <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> did _ <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> _ and its two Democratic senators issued a joint statement saying the commission should have looked at overseas bases before targeting domestic installations. `` How can we justify closing military bases in our own back yard when we do n't even consider a single one of the 1,500 overseas <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities for the same treatment?'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on readiness. `` The overseas bases ought to be looked at first to make sure the need is still there,'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said they thought the commission had done the best job it could under various constraints, some imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and others, like a relatively short study period, imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the panel had to use current Pentagon budget figures, even though the new spending plan going to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next month is expected to be lower, changing the parameters for evaluating the need for some bases. He specifically said the commission approached <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> installations with the assumption the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battle fleet would have 600 ships, a goal he said is not attainable in the forseeable future. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also questioned wby the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> prevented the commission from studying the need for defense facilities owned by the government and operated by private contractors.

 Surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> is pregnant with her fifth child and is planning a 22-city promotional tour in March of a book she co-wrote about the Baby M case, her lawyer and publisher said Thursday. `` The book's focus is going to be a lot about the ills of how people are affected by surrogacy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arenstein </PERSON>, her attorney. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> feels `` it's her duty to convey to the public what surrogacy has done to her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s unsuccessful legal fight to keep the child she agreed to bear for another couple sparked nationwide debate on surrogacy contracts. The book, `` A Mother's Story,'' was written with <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> investigative journalist <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz-Nobel </PERSON> and published by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The first printing will be 100,000 copies, and the company has set aside $ 100,000 for advertising and promotion, said <PERSON> Maryanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzola </PERSON>, publicity director for the publisher. The 31-year-old Mrs. Whitehead-Gould lives in <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, with her second husband and three of her children _ <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 14; Tuesday, 12, and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, 7 months, <PERSON> Arenstein </PERSON> said. `` She is pregnant and she is happy about it,'' the attorney added. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> gave birth in 1986 to the girl originally known in court papers as Baby M. At the time, she was married to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain under a recently extended long-term agreement between the two countries, including a new deal for 420,000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the wheat was part of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON> said the wheat is for shipment in January. Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the Soviets have about 1.6 million tons still available under the program. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The pact expired Sept. 30 but was later extended for another year. Department officials said also the Soviets bought an additional 314,256 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn that had previously been reported by exporters as headed for `` unknown destinations.'' The corn sales are not subsidized. With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 10.4 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery in the sixth year of the supply agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized, totaled slightly more than 9 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 420,000 tons of wheat would be about 15.4 million bushels. The latest corn sales would be about 12.4 million bushels. Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $ 4 per bushel, according to recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> market figures, making the new sale worth an estimated $ 62 million. The corn, at $ 2.60 per bushel, could have a farm value of about $ 32 million. Besides the corn and wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 450,000 tons of soybeans and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. <PERSON> Goldthwaite </PERSON> said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 21.75 per ton, or about 59 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses on the 420,000 tons of wheat will be paid to three companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 120,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 250,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000.

<TEXT>
 A gay midshipmen who says he was forced to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, after admitting his homosexuality two months before his scheduled graduation, asked a federal court on Thursday to order his reinstatement. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Moorhead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, claimed in the suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that his `` forced separation'' from the academy violated his constitutional rights of free speech, due process and equal protection under the law. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettelbrick </PERSON>, legal director for the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a homosexual rights advocacy group acting as <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON>'s legal counsel, said that, to her knowledge, the suit is the first of its kind against a service academy. <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON>, now employed by a computer software company in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, acknowledged that he was aware of a provision in the midshipmen's manual that homosexuals would be dismissed from the academy. Although <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON> said that he realized by the end of his sophomore year that he was homosexual, he tried to keep it apart from his life as a midshipman until he was informed in March 1987 that he was being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. At the time <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON> was a battalion commander in charge of one-sixth of the academy's 4,500 midshipmen, a solo performer with the academy glee club, and in the top 10 percent of his class, according to the suit. Upon learning of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation, <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON> said he admitted to a chaplain and then to the academy's commandant, Capt. H.W. <PERSON> Habermeyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, that we was a homosexual. Within eight days, a brigade performance board and an academic board on the <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, campus recommended <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON>'s discharge after determining that he had an `` insufficient aptitude'' for a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer's commission, according to the suit. `` The boards said my evaluations were completely irrelevant,'' <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON> said at a news conference here Thursday. `` All they needed to have was that I was gay. They never even looked at my record.'' <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON> said he agreed to submit a qualified resignation rather than fight a dismissal because of stress that his situation was causing his family and because his father was suffering from high blood pressure at the time. The suit names <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> in addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>'s superintendent and commandant as defendants <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, said the school only abided by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulations. `` Since we are a part of the Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, we are bound by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulations which state homosexuality is incompatible with military service,'' <PERSON> Fromer </PERSON> said. In the suit, <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON> is seeking re-admission to the academy, a diploma from it and a commission in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, but he conceded the unlikelihood of winning the latter by the time the case winds its way through the courts. `` If I'm 30 years old at the time, I'm not going to be in much of a position to go in as an ensign,'' he said. `` My goal is not only to get a diploma but to have this policy of discimination reversed.''

<HEAD>Closure Of Historic Base Could Be Birth of Park</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The closing of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base on a hillside overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge could transform one of the city's loveliest spots into a park _ at the cost of thousands of civilian jobs. The Presidio was one of 34 military bases recommended for closing by a government commission Thursday. The panel also said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> should not base the USS Missouri at Hunters Point, an issue that has divided the city for years. The recommendation to close the Presidio surprised and disappointed city officials and neighborhood businessmen, even though the commission said the move would have minimal impact on local employment. Founded by the Spanish in 1776 and operated as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base since 1846, the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> is one of the most important spots in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> history. Now headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, it employs about 3,000 civilians and 2,700 servicemen. `` I think it will have a significant effect on the economy unless the commission is definite in recommending that there be economic assistance to communities near bases,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, a Democrat whose district is next to the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION>. The base, she said, is the third-largest employer in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and has an annual payroll of $ 600 million. `` It's bad. We need this -LRB- base -RRB-. I hope it does n't happen,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakileh </PERSON>, a delicatessen owner who estimated that half his business over the past 20 years has come from the nearby base. Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said the commission's decision had `` very grave consequences'' for the city. He planned to meet with the local congressional delegation to evaluate the effect of losing the base. `` For 112 years the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> has been an integral part of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It was here before <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was a city. It's been a very good neighbor and ... an important part of our economy,'' he said. The site's future is restricted by the 1972 law that established the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, which includes most of the base. Except for 36 acres belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Letterman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, all 1,490 acres would come under the control of the park. The hospital also is slated for closing. Commercial development would not be allowed on the property, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the park area superintendent. Open space, recreational and educational use and preservation of historic buildings at the base would be the most likely uses, he said. Servicemen and civilians at the Presidio were apprehensive about the prospect of leaving what many consider the most beautiful military base in the nation, the site of last year's film `` The Presidio,'' starring <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. `` It's long been considered a prime assignment. ... It's sort of a combination military office building, museum and park all rolled into one,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON>, Presidio chief of community relations. The base is mostly open to the public and is often the scene of bicycle races, running events and picnics. Thousands of people gather there every Fourth of July to watch fireworks over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. In its proposal to close the base, the commission said the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> has no space for expansion and the <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> hospital needs structural repairs. Closure would save $ 74.1 million a year, the committee estimated. The panel also said <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the airfield for the Presidio and a training center for reserve units, should be shut down. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, it said, should drop plans to base a battleship at the Hunters Point Naval shipyard on the bay. A base was to be built there if the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decided that the area should be the home port for the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and its group. The proposal to make <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> the battleship group's base generated heavy debate. In November, voters narrowly passed a proposition supporting the basing plan. Missouri supporters said the battleship group would pump millions of dollars into the city's economy and provide hundreds of jobs.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some instruments have failed on board a satellite headed for the Martian moon Phobos, but the mission is not in jeopardy, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The Soviets have lost the first of the pair of probes, Phobos I and Phobos II, heading for <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Reports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week said the second satellite also was experiencing problems, putting the entire project in danger. `` Routine equipment checks revealed isolated malfunctions in some of the instruments on board'' Phobos II, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But it quoted <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogovsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Babakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> as saying that `` most have been rectified while the rest wo n't prevent the research program from being carried out in full.'' Phobos I was launched on July 7, but in September a wrong computer command caused it to stop responding to commands from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and it was lost. <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, launched days later, continues on course toward <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. It is to enter a Mars orbit late next month and approach the moon Phobos in April. Its package of instruments and experiments were prepared by a group of 12 countries and by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, but the project is especially valuable to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because Soviet scientists are aiming for a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> early in the 21st century. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Phobos I and Phobos II carried almost identical equipment, but the lost probe carried instruments to register neutron radiation from Phobos' surface and to study Mars' magnetic field _ not included on Phobos II. On approaching Mars, Phobos II will take infrared and gamma ray readings, compile a temperature map and data on its mineral make-up, atmosphere and ionosphere, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Moving on to Phobos, it will drop to within 165 feet to analyze the <LOCATION> Martian </LOCATION> moon's soil with the help of a laser, and then drop two small landing craft onto the moon's surface.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will hold hearings in February and March on lifting a World War II-era regulation that bars apparel manufacturers from employing seamstresses in their homes, officials said Thursday. The department will publish in Friday's edition of the Federal Register an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking as the first formal step for lifting the ban, said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, a deputy assistant labor secretary in charge of enforcing the prohibition. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged the action last October after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> won approval from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget office to remove homework prohibitions in five other apparel fields effective Jan. 8. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> two weeks before the election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had been assured `` that the last piece of this rulemaking will be given top priority for clearance.'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will hold hearings on the proposal in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Feb. 22-23; in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on March 2-3; and in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on March 8-9. `` The department believes that changing demographics such as more women working demand increased workforce flexibility, including the option to work in one's home,'' he said. `` The current ban forecloses that possibility.'' The prohibitions on apparel industry homework were imposedin 1942 to combat widespread exploitation of immigrants and other low-wage workers. Lifting them has been the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's top deregulatory proposal in the labor relations area for the past several years. The administration succeed in 1984 in removing the ban on knitted outerwear but was thwarted by court rulings in response to suits from unions in lifting the prohibitions in six other apparel fields. However, two days after the election, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced it was removing the prohibitions, effective Jan. 8, in five apparel fields: gloves and mittens, embroideries, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry. The Labor Department estimates between 9,000 and 100,000 workers are employed in those five industries, compared with up to 500,000 in women's apparel. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents some 170,000 workers, said last week it will seek a court injunction next week to prohibit the further removal of any of the remaining bans on homework.

 Two French girls held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for 13 months returned home Thursday night, six days after their captors _ the Palestinian guerrilla group commanded by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> _ first promised them freedom. Left behind in the hands of Fatah-Revolutionary Council were the girls' mother, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>; five Belgians also captured aboard the yacht <PERSON> Silco </PERSON>; and a baby sister born in captivity. <PERSON> Marie-Laure </PERSON> <PERSON> Betille </PERSON>, 7, and her 6-year-old sister, <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>, landed at a military base in <LOCATION> Istres </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, in a government plane with their father, <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> <PERSON> Betille </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. They came from the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, where the girls were handed over to <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who bankrolls the guerrilla faction, had called for the girls' release on Christmas Eve. Later Thursday, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> as calling for the release of all hostages. `` Once again, I ask the Fatah-Revolutionary Council and the rest of the liberation movements in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to respond to my appeal for the release of the remaining hostages on this holy occasion,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was quoted as saying, in apparent reference to Christmas. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> ... welcomes this humanitarian gesture in appropriate measure'' and `` it thanks foreign authorities who contributed.'' The statement did not elaborate. The guerrilla group's spokesman, <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, that the release was a `` gift to the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities, all <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> political parties, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people and President -LRB- <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the name of the children of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, the children of the revolution of the stones, on the occasion of Christmas and New Year.'' He was referring to the year-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said the girls received medical examinations and were found to `` enjoy good health.'' <PERSON> Betille </PERSON>, the girls' divorced father, told Radio-Television <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> that his children would undergo medical examinations at a <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> hospital. The girls arrived Thursday in the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier, but it did not say from where. On Monday, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> said the girls were freed and on their way to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but they did n't turn up and the Palestinian group issued contradictory statements. Two official cars were placed at the disposal of the girls' family in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, southeastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and the relatives were to leave for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to welcome the children home `` That's 14 months that we have been fighting for the release of the hostages,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Metral </PERSON>, brother-in-law of the girls' mother `` I remain reserved as long as I have not seen the two little girls in the arms of their father.'' His wife, <PERSON> Anne-Marie </PERSON>, sister of Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, said: `` After hope disappointed ... all these false joys have upset us. Now we know that they are free, we want to see them and above all to continue the fight for the other hostages.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> announced the capture of the hostages on Nov. 8, 1987, saying the yacht was seized off the coast of the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It accused the captives of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a charge that family members and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have denied. The group has been blamed for hijackings, bombings and assassinations since it broke with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1976. Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON> gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in a recent videotape that she is pregnant again. The case is considered unrelated to the 15 Westerners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian factions.

<HEAD>Indian Artifact No Fact, Says Reasearcher: In Fact, It's `Mammoth
Fraud'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A piece of shell jewelry once hailed as a 10,000-year-old Indian relic depicting a woolly mammoth is really about 1,000 years old and was found in the last century by a shady amateur archaeologist, an anthropologist says. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Meltzer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> called the carving resembling the animal that became extinct 10,000 years ago a `` mammoth fraud.'' He spent eight years researching the history of the piece, a hand-size whelk shell pendant, and used carbon 14 dating to determine its age. The pendant was rediscovered in the 1970s by <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> researchers who found it in a drawer, where it apparently had lain since the end of the 19th century. It had been produced by <PERSON> Hilbourne </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cresson </PERSON> as a discovery he'd made in northern <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> But for some reason, the artifact, known as the <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Oak </PERSON> pendant, was forgotten about for decades, <PERSON> Meltzer </PERSON> said. By the time it was noticed again, archaeologists had proven that humans lived with woolly mammoths in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, at least in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> area. It had been known since 1864 that man lived at the same time as the beasts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>; that was the year that a mammoth tusk was found at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madeliene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, with etchings on it. In May 1976, Science magazine carried an article attributed to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, a geologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, that the pendant could be authentic, but one year later he told another journal the piece might be a fraud. When <PERSON> Metzler </PERSON> began his investigation in 1981, he found <PERSON> Cresson </PERSON> claimed to have found the pendant in 1864 but told no one about it until 1889. The researcher checked newspaper microfilms that might have clues about <PERSON> Cresson </PERSON>. `` When the microfilm came back, I was flabbergasted,'' <PERSON> Meltzer </PERSON> said. According to front-page stories, <PERSON> Cresson </PERSON> `` blew his brains out'' in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> park. One report quoted his suicide note as saying he was suspected of counterfeiting and was being followed by <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents. <PERSON> Metzler </PERSON> learned that <PERSON> Cresson </PERSON> had studied art and archaeology in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> about the time of the La Madeliene discovery. `` The more we learned about <PERSON> Cresson </PERSON>, the more suspicious we got,'' he said. The carbon dating, measuring the amount of radioactive carbon 14 left in the pendant, was the final confirmation.

<TEXT>
 The noontime peal of church bells Thursday implored Peruvians to interrupt their activities and pray for an end to a vicious leftist insurgency that has bloodied <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s landscape and shrouded its future. Police and fire sirens roared and many motorists stopped their cars and honked in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and other cities to usher in a `` minute of silence for peace.'' Thousands elsewhere in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> froze in their tracks on downtown and suburban streets for a moment of private reflection, but many others others went about their business, ignoring the event. Officials say nearly 2,000 people have died in the leftist insurgency of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group since the first nationwide peace vigil was held exactly one year ago. `` Too much blood has been spilled. This is both a silent invitation and the clamor of the multitudes. We want peace,'' Cardinal <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Landazuri </PERSON> said in a nationally televised speech. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s Municipal Palace, where <PERSON> Landazuri </PERSON> spoke in a ceremony attended by dozens of the nation's leaders, was guarded by scores of heavily armed police, a stark reminder of the possibility of a terror attack. Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse a noon march near the Municipal Palace of about 300 members of the Confederation of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laborers </ORGANIZATION>, said reporters on the scene. The protesters said they were marching to demand that authorities release a confederation leader arrested three weeks ago. Police have denied the man was detained. In the highland, where rebel violence has been heaviest, Thursday's vigil passed unheeded in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. But church bells rang and sirens wailed in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, witnesses said. The protest against terrorism came as <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> faces a severe economic recession. Inflation is expected to hit 1,800 percent this year. A recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s commission on violence said the economic woes and the insurgency and repressive countermeasures by government forces were undermining <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s democracy. The commission said the roots of the insurgency are imbedded in centuries of hatred and discrimination between <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s rich and poor. Along with increasing reports of violence since October, newspapers daily carry stories on factory shutdowns, layoffs, a dramatic fall in public spending power and growing lines for basic foods. `` <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s general crisis brings us toward decisive years during which our revolution will accelerate powerfully,'' the leader and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Abimael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, said recently during his only published interview since the fighting began. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> launched the insurgency to topple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government and install Marxist rule in May 1980. Since then, the fighting has killed more than 12,000 people and has spread throughout the central highlands, down to the major coastal cities and into the eastern jungle. Among those slain this year were one American and two French agricultural development workers, the first foreigners known to have been executed purposely by the guerrillas. To counter the guerrillas, the government has installed states of emergency, giving the military broad policing and governing powers in eight states where more than half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 21 million people live. Both the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the New York-based Americas Watch sharply criticized <LOCATION> Peruvian </LOCATION> authorities in reports this year for tolerating human rights violations.

<TEXT>
 The stepped up security measures for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliners around the world announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday are directed primarily against one type of bomb that has so far defied all detection methods _ plastic explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announced it is requiring tightened security by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers at 103 airports in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including X-ray or physical inspection of all checked baggage and random physical checks of some carry-on baggage. Investigators sifting through the debris of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 which crashed last week in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> have determined that a powerful plastic bomb blew up the giant <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, killing its 259 occupants and 11 people on the ground. Attention has focused on one type of plastic explosive which has been used in the past with frightening success by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terrorists _ an odorless, orange substance known as Semtex. `` It's a favorite with these groups because it's significantly harder to detect than anything else, it's more powerful than other plastics,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst for many years and now a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a Communist country which has a well-developed state-run arms and munitions industry, makes Semtex at a plant called the Eastern Bohemian Works. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have asked the Czechs to desist from production of Semtex or at least to prevent its export. Recently, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> indicated it might be willing to stop selling Semtex, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON>, who has served as a consultant to government security and intelligence agencies and has written seven books on international security and terrorism. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is believed to have supplied Semtex to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, said one <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also makes plastic explosives for use by the military. But those substances, known as C-4, are not available to commercial users such as dynamiting contractors. Like C-4, Semtex is malleable like putty and shows up on an X-ray operator's screen as an indistinguishable dense mass. But unlike C-4 and other known plastic bombs, Semtex is completely odorless. Semtex also has the advantage of being stable, meaning it can not go off unless it is meant to. Conventional X-ray machines, as well as bomb sniffing dogs, have so far been thwarted by Semtex and C-4. But researchers have come up with what they say is a nearly foolproof response. The machine goes by the name of Thermal Neutron Analysis device, or <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION>, and is about twice the size of an airport X-ray machine. During the yearlong test in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> airports under a contract from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, it demonstrated a 95 percent detection rate with few false alarms, the agency said. As part of the new security measures announced Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it is accelerating by six months the delivery of more TNAs. Under the accelerated program, the first unit will be in operation next summer and the last of five, perhaps six, will be operational by the beginning of 1990. The agency said it had not been decided where to place the thermal neutron equipment, which could go into airports either in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or overseas or a combination of the two. Each unit costs $ 750,000 to $ 1 million. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the device is capable of scanning a piece of luggage in six seconds and can be adapted for use with a conveyor system that could handle large numbers of baggage in relatively short periods of time with a low rate of false alarms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodzins </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> consultant, said that until now, `` there was no impetus. There was no public demand to put them into airports.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster has provided the impetus to move the TNAs from the experimental to the operational stage. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> _ with a nudge from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ stepped up its development of bomb detection devices after a terrorist bomb apparently caused an <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet to crash off the Irish coast in l985 and a bomb detonated aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in 1986, killing four Americans. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> bombing was determined to have been caused by Semtex and carried out by a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> faction known as the May 15 organization. Semtex also was the culprit in a foiled attempt sponsored by the Syrian government to blow up an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> airliner at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport in 1986

<HEAD>Embassy Charges Terrorist Groups Learned From Arafat Organization</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Israeli government said Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> set the examples for all terrorist groups which attack civilian airplanes and their passengers. A statement titled `` PLO: The first of its kind,'' did not directly link <PERSON> Yassar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group to the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jetliner that crashed last week in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and killed all 259 aboard and an estimated 11 people on the ground. But the statement, released by the Israeli embassy, said all terrorist groups that have targeted civil aviation in recent years `` learned from one source _ the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization was the first to hijack an airplane, an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> fight in 1968; the first to destroy a plane in midair, a <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1970; and the first to carry out a gun-and-grenade attack on passengers, an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> plane in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1968, the statement said. `` Internationalist terrorist organizations have learned from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in other areas as well,'' the embassy said. It cited the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympics in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and the seizure of the Israeli embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, also in 1972. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators so far have been unable to pinpoint the person or group that placed a bomb aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane. At least two radical Palestinian organizations, both outside the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, are among a wide spectrum of possible suspects. These are The Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has throughout the years develped links and cooperated, at times very closely, with other terror organizations,'' the Israeli statement said, `` providing them with funds, arms, training and operational assistance.'' In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, it said, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and others used terror methods which they first learned from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> before breaking away to form their own groups. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> itself `` has not ended its own campaign of terror, but has only redefined the direction, range and tactical form of the ` armed struggle,' which is another definition of terror and violence sanctioned by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. `` From earlier years to more recent attacks, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> violence shows that when it comes to terrorism, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wrote the book.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of terrorism last month as he denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He called the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman an `` accessory'' to terrorism. Subsequently, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he renounced terrorism `` in all forms'' and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> approved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the first authorized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 13 years. The first session was held Dec. 16 in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Afterward, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and other senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials cautioned the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the `` substantive dialogue'' would be terminated if acts of terrorism were traced to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. There have been no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> since.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Soar After Devaluation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates soared in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Thursday as skepticism grew over the government's decision to devalue the shekel. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank, raised its lending rate to banks and other large financial institutions to 48.25 percent a year, compared to 32.8 percent a week ago. The rate is high because of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s high inflation rate. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leumi </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest commercial bank, raised its basic lending rate to 2 percent a month from 1.5 percent. Other financial institutions were expected to follow suit. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said people are `` panicked'' and many believe further devaluation is imminent. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> published more bad news at a news conference Thursday. It estimated that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s gross national product _ the value of all goods and services produced in the economy _ grew 1 percent this year, down from 5.2 percent in 1987. Figures were adjusted for inflation. <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadar </PERSON>, director of the bureau's national accounts division, told reporters the slowdown reflected declines in industrial production and agricultural output as well as side-effects from the year-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the occupied territories. Palestinians boycotted Israeli-made products and some quit jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, reducing the output of industries like textiles and construction. <PERSON> Hadar </PERSON> estimated the uprising cost $ 300 million in sales, and cancellation of the Israeli-built Lavi fighter jet reduced sales another $ 300 million. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>' s unemployment rate was above 7 percent compared to 6.1 percent last year, he said. The government on Tuesday devalued the shekel by 5 percent in an effort to stem a speculative buying binge of foreign currencies. That lowered the currency to 1.680 shekels to the dollar from 1.599. Purchases of foreign currencies, especially the dollar, slowed to $ 70 million from $ 80 million on Wednesday and a record $ 135 million on Tuesday, said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakobi </PERSON>. Critics say the devaluation is inflationary and badly timed, throwing off year-end closing of corporate balance sheets. Business leaders believe a larger devaluation is needed next year to bring the shekel more in line with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amit </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said companies with foreign currency debts have had to revalue them upward by 5 percent in shekels, reducing their profits for the year. `` It hurts their credit lines, it hurts their efforts to attract investment, it hurts all around,'' <PERSON> Amit </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, trying to counter a wave of negative publicity, said Thursday it will regularly use electrical current devices to detect the tiniest of gaps in the bodies of older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s. `` We had an unfortunate incident and we are responding,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive vice president, referring to Monday's emergency landing of an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, with a 14-inch tear in its After the incident, in which two people suffered minor injures, the airline visually inspected the 46 oldest of its 111 727s _ those with 30,000 or more landings. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Upton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> vice president for maintenance and engineering, said that currently, the airline inspects its planes visually. When it suspects a crack in an obscure place, it uses electrical detectors known as eddy-current devices. <PERSON> Upton </PERSON> said the devices have been recalibrated to go deeper into the metal and detect a gap of one-130 ,000 th of an inch, and will be used on older Boeings on a regular How often depends on results of the electrical inspection of the 46 oldest jets, he said. The rivet-to-rivet testing will be conducted on a 100-inch-long stretch of the planes, from about the last row of seats to the rear door. The 22-year-old plane that tore open Monday developed the hole in the roof near the tail. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was grounded in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Monday after a three-inch crack was discovered near the tail. On Wednesday Eastern maintenance workers in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> found corrosion near fuselage rivets on a 727. The company also disclosed that cracks were found in a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 during an unrelated, previously begun industrywide inspection of DC-9 planes with 55,000 or more landings. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said tiny, nonhazardous cracks are found in aircraft every day during routine inspections. `` This is not an Eastern-exclusive problem. It's absolutely consistent with the industry,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. He also said the age of the aircraft was being overemphasized and he said a plane's age does n't necessarily affect its safety. The tear on the flight Monday was from inside an overlap of aluminum on the fuselage, `` a new twist,'' <PERSON> Upton </PERSON> said. The routine visual inspections conducted after 1,100 landings could n't detect such `` inside-out'' tearing, he said. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said it will take about a month for the electrical testing to be completed on the 46 planes. By then, the company would know better the cause of the tear that forced Monday's emergency landing and will adjust its maintenance program accordingly, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will propose in January that operators of older 727s be required to replace some rivets, agency spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said it had not been determined how many airplanes would be covered.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives when he visits <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, is one of the biggest installations put on the chopping block Thursday, and officials hunted for ways to soften the $ 340 million shock. News that the 33-year-old base, home to some of the country's top bomber groups, might close as soon as January 1990 shocked many people in the state. The base employs 3,700 military personnel and 500 civilians. There also are an estimated 1,700 secondary jobs stemming from the base, and the closing is expected to cost $ 340 million to the economy within a 100-mile radius. Base commander Col. <PERSON> Orin </PERSON> <PERSON> Godsey </PERSON> said local officials `` were amazed, and I do n't think they expected it'' when he met with them to break the news. `` It's like a lot of other communities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today because no one ever wants to think they will be on the closure list.'' The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure proposed that 34 military installations be closed. It also recommended partially closing five other bases and reorganizing 54 more that would get new missions and additional personnel. <PERSON> Godsey </PERSON> said despite the shock, local officials `` had a very positive outlook. They're looking at ways they can make the military base a usable installation.'' One of the most frequently mentioned ideas was to convert the base into a regional airport. The state's congressional delegation, who supported creation of the commission, said they would not fight the closing if it is justified. `` I do n't want to raise false expectations about altering this recommendation,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, a conservative Republican. `` At this juncture, it looks like a foregone conclusion that it will close. It's highly unlikely that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will reject this list. `` If there's a good case to be made to close <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, so be it. Military bases are n't forever.'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, another conservative Republican, said he and the rest of the delegation planned to meet with people in the state to acertain their feelings. `` If they want me to fight it, I'll fight it,'' he said The commission recommended closing <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> because of a shortage of facilities at the base and its vulnerability to sub-launched ballistic missiles that could strike before its planes get off the ground, the panel said. <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> opened in 1956 and has been home of the <ORGANIZATION> 509th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bombardment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, whose predecessor, the <ORGANIZATION> 509th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, dropped the bomb on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>. In 1985 <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> was listed in the book `` Nuclear Battlefields'' as having 190 atomic warheads, ranking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> 21st among the states. The federal government does not acknowledge where it keeps its nuclear weapons. Since its founding, <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> has been a base for B-29, B-52 and B-47 bombers. Today it deploys KC-135 refueling tankers and FB-111 fighter bombers.

 A brother of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crewman came seeking a Bible on Thursday from the church near the spot where the cockpit of Flight 103 fell. `` I said he could take the Bibles or take anything else he thought might help,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> of Tundergarth Parish Church. `` He had free rein to take what he wanted.'' The brother wanted to take the Bible `` to his old mother in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a memento of near where her son had died,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. The country church is three miles east of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, where the jumbo jet crashed Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and leaving 11 people on the ground missing and presumed dead. Investigators said the crash was caused by a bomb in the cargo hold. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, brother of First Officer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Pennington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, had approached police in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> about obtaining two prayer books. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said there were no prayer books in the <ORGANIZATION> Calvinist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, but that he was welcome to take King <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibles </PERSON>. The bodies of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> MacQuarrie </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, were among the first to be released this week to next-of-kin. Royal Engineers using circular saws cut the nose of the plane into sections for transport to the Air Accident Investigation Branch's facility in <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The nose, still displaying the plane's designation Clipper Maid of the Seas, is the largest piece of wreckage and one of the few immediately recognizable as part of an aircraft. The engineers and members of the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fusiliers </LOCATION> are billeted in the Tundergarth church. The nose fell just beyond the churchyard wall. Several relatives of the dead came to the site with flowers on Thursday. Despite the disaster, the church went ahead with its Christmas service, `` one of the most difficult I have ever had to prepare in the 26 years of my ministry,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` The only thing I could possibly tell them was God was with us.'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, like other ministers and priests in the area, has taken on an unexpected burden of counseling grief-stricken parishioners and relatives of the dead. Social workers who have also been counseling townspeople say they have encountered some who refused to face up to the disaster. `` We are experiencing a typical part of the Scots' personality which says ` We do n't want help,''' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMenamy </PERSON>, director of the regional department of social work. `` People are denying the event happened at all and we have got to make sure they do n't stay like that. ... `` The fact it was a bomb gives them a focus for anger. They know now how it happened, but they do n't know who did it; but it is much healthier to know how something happened.'' It may be months before the town of 2,500 people regains its normal appearance. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the detective who is heading a criminal investigation based in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, said he was prepared for a long and painstaking operation. As the search continues, helicopters are frequently overhead, and military and rescue vehicles jam the streets. Outside the Town Hall, being used as a temporary morgue, the pile of flowers from relatives of the dead and from sympathizers in several countries has grown daily. In private meetings arranged for residents of damaged areas, several people have complained about being questioned by some of the dozens of reporters on the scene, according to a local newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Annandale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's been no Christmas in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>,'' one young man said Wednesday night as he edged away from a camera crew. `` I do n't want to talk about it. No one wants to talk about it.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON>, a spokesman for the social work department, said nearly $ 360,000 had been collected for relief work in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. More than half that amount came from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and its insurer. The local parish of the Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> is planning a memorial service Jan. 4, and arrangements have been made to seat expected overflow crowds in other halls and churches. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> minister from nearby <LOCATION> Lochmaben </LOCATION>, wrote in the `` Reflections'' column of the <ORGANIZATION> Annandale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, that there were no easy answers to the disaster. `` If you want truth, take your coat off and sit down. This will take whatever time truth takes,'' he wrote. `` There is a time for everything, and when the time comes to speak of other things we will. Now we need to give ourselves a time to mourn.''

 Seven-year-old AIDS victim <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> will be reunited with her two brothers and two sisters next week when the siblings are flown here from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The visiting children are 8 to 12 years old and live with two sets of adoptive parents. They will be accompanied by their mothers and stay at a hotel for about five days, officials said. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>, who acquired AIDS through blood transfusions shortly after her premature birth, has become widely known through her mother's court battles to enroll her in a public school. School officials barred the girl from class, saying she might transmit the AIDS virus because she is mentally impaired and not toilet trained. A federal judge ruled <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> could attend classes if she were isolated in a glass booth. The child's adoptive mother, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, fought that decision, saying she refused to let the girl `` sit in a cage.'' A federal appeals court has ordered hearings to determine whether the youngster poses a health threat. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>, who speaks through sign language, may not understand that the four children coming to visit are her biological brothers and sisters, her mother said Wednesday. `` I'm going to tell her she's going to have children playing with her,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` She does n't know what to think of little people. I do n't even know if she realizes she is one.'' All but the eldest of the children were taken from their parents in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> at birth, said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who adopted <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> in 1982 after hearing a radio appeal for someone to take in a homeless toddler. `` Their parents were the equivalent of the homeless people here. The oldest got to live with them about three months'' but was neglected and then placed with a welfare agency. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s siblings know who their baby sister is from seeing her on television and in the newspapers, said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. She said their mothers have encouraged them to write <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>. The little girl was hospitalized with pneumonia and congestive heart failure for a week in early December but has recovered, said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who added, `` She's into everything. `` I just want her to have children to play with. I do n't know how she'll react,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` She's got no social skills.'' The children and their adoptive parents are expected to arrive on Jan. 2. The group plans a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, outings to parks `` and quiet evenings at home with <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister on Thursday sought to tie the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and blamed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk to the guerrilla organization for encouraging international terrorism. The statement by <PERSON> Binyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, a leading member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, follows repeated Israeli criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for including <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. `` By having these kinds of talks ... you are sending a message, a very clear message, that terrorism pays,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> told a news conference. `` The American talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have seriously weakenened the American effort against terrorism.'' He said suspicion in the Dec. 21 Pan Am bombing focused on groups experienced with the type of explosives used in the blast, including the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. However, he said he had no firm information on who was to blame for the bombing, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security expert said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction was `` not a likely candidate. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>'s comments echoed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s, who suggested Tuesday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision was encouraging renewed infiltration attacks along the Israeli border. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the American move `` encouraged the tendency of violent acts against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier this week that a major <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign policy goal would be to reverse <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` the foremost practitioner of aviation terrorism.'' It was responsible for the first airliner hijacking, the first destruction of a passenger plane in midair and the first gun and grenade attack on passengers, he said. `` I say the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, I mean Fatah, I mean <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>,'' he said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief's mainstream guerrilla group. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> spoke at a news conference called to announce an international seminar on airline security in February in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The conference focused on the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in which more than 260 people died in the air and on the ground. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merari </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> terrorism expert, told reporters at the news conference that he doubted the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would have carried out the attack when <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is making statements about peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think the present political situation is such that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would sponsor such an attack,'' he said. `` My guess is at least for a while they'll refrain from international terrorism because it is politically counterproductive.'' <PERSON> Merari </PERSON>, director of a project on terrorism at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said earlier he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> attackers probably were radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions opposed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s more moderate stands. He said it was such splinter groups that actually carried out the first hijacking and first blowing up of a plane in midair, not <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> began criticizing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced Dec. 14 that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had met American demands for inclusion in the peace process by recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renouncing terrorism. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s new government included in its political program a refusal to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist organization.

 <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moloi </PERSON>, 17, had his picture printed on the front page of The Sowetan newspaper Thursday, the only high school student in the township of 2.5 million to graduate with a `` B'' grade average. There were no `` A'' students among the 4,508 who took their final examinations in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Only five of all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black students had `` A'' averages. Nationwide, 57.4 percent of the 170,966 full-time black high school students who wrote final exams passed, a slight improvement over last year's 56.9 percent. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, 37.8 percent of all high school seniors passed, an increase over last year's 32 percent. `` There is no reason to believe that black children are less intelligent than whites. ... But year after year the black matriculation results are disastrous,'' said The Sowetan in an editorial. `` The sensible view surely should be to improve black education. Blacks will outnumber whites in ever-increasing numbers as we reach the turn of the century. Black skills will be needed with ever-increasing desperation,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sowetan </ORGANIZATION> said. In the 1950s, under legislation supporting the apartheid system of race separation, the white government instituted an inferior education system for blacks and prohibited them from attending missionary and other private schools where most of today's black leaders received their education. Today the government says its standards for black education are the same as for whites. But since resources are allocated by race, the amount of money spent on a white child's education is five times that spent on a black. Black schools also have been wracked by boycotts since nationwide unrest broke out in 1984. Although there was no boycott this year, graduating students had years of material with which to catch up. Another disadvantage is that many of their teachers themselves have not passed the high school graduation examination.

He also noted in a Wednesday night broadcast that the country's economic reform policy is based on competition Some people would be better off under the reforms, but others would lose ground, he cautioned. `` We of course have to be aware of this problem. We have to put on the agenda the problem of caring for the weakest,'' he said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said the government hopes to limit inflation to 20 percent next year. However, officially published estimates have projected an overall inflation rate of 50 percent in 1989, compared with 60 to 70 percent in 1988. Incomes have outstripped available supplies. Consumer hoarding of limited goods, such as gasoline and paper supplies, exacerbates shortages in stores. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> appealed to Poles to observe `` the principle of reason.'' `` It is necessary to limit demand in our conditions,'' he said. `` I think I should ask citizens not to stock up needlessly.

 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s official spokesman said Thursday that a special committee of experts has started discussing possible formation of a provisional Palestinian government. Spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that the Palestinian experts in international law and government will report their findings to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> within a month. He said a provisional government could be expected to represent the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> at the proposed international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. `` Everything depends on the outcome of the effort to form a preparatory committee for the international conference. If all goes well we will immediately proclaim the provisional government,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s legislature, declared an independent Palestinian state at its meeting in November. It passed a resolution authorizing the Executive Committee, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s governing body, to look into the feasibility of forming a provisional government In <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the government has officially invited <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to visit, a move seen by some newspapers as signalling a policy shift toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> information office in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, who spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on condition his name not be used, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> accepted the invitation and was likely to go to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> within a month. But Foreign Ministry official <PERSON> Pertti </PERSON> <PERSON> Torstila </PERSON> said a formal reply was still awaited and details had not been worked out yet. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitam </PERSON> said the invitation `` does not contribute to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expected to meet President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Kalevi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorsa </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> has refused to officially recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, although it allowed the Palestinian umbrella group to establish an office in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> five years ago. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> meanwhile was quoted as saying in an interview released Thursday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to begin a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was `` a good start.'' The London-based magazine <PERSON> Al-Hawadeth </PERSON> also quoted the monarch as saying he expects President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make more headway in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has more experience and interest in world problems. `` The world is beginning to face solving the Palestinian problem, which is the most dangerous problem.

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prominent Yugoslav human rights activist and dissident, <PERSON> Dobroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Paraga </PERSON>, said he was granted a passport to travel abroad on Thursday, eight years after his passport was taken away from him. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the passport was delivered to him in this Slovenian capital following his 16-day hunger strike and appeals by <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> intellectuals, including Cardinal <PERSON> Franjo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuharic </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>. The last time <PERSON> Paraga </PERSON> requested the passport was when West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> invited him to attend a Dec. 12 meeting in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> organized by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to mark the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. Asked about his travel plans, <PERSON> Paraga </PERSON> said in his telephone interview: `` Now that I missed the meeting with <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, I have no other invitation or financial means to travel abroad.'' He was arrested in 1980 and sentenced to four years' imprisonment for collecting signatures on a petition calling for authorities to free political prisoners. After his release, he published an account of his prison experiences in which he claimed political offenders routinely are mistreated by prison guards. In April 1987, he received a 6-month suspended sentence on charges of spreading false information about treatment of political prisoners. <PERSON> Paraga </PERSON> said his brother <PERSON> Domagoj </PERSON> has not yet received a passport taken away when <PERSON> Paraga </PERSON> was arrested eight years ago. `` Hundreds of former political prisoners are still being denied that right,'' he said. In an apparent easing of restraints, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s collective federal presidency on Tuesday granted amnesty to 25 prisoners jailed for political offenses. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, the state news agency, said 68 such prisoners were freed this year. The vast majority of Yugoslavs routinely get passports and are free to travel abroad.

 Rescuers plucked five seamen from 25-foot swells in the stormy <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on Thursday, but one was dead and another died and six others were missing after their 254-foot ship sank, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The ship <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bermuda </ORGANIZATION> sank Wednesday night 160 miles south of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> and 200 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> when its cargo shifted in weather that was `` nothing short of horrendous,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. `` The last of the crew to get off said they watched the ship sink,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Rescuers searching for survivors were hindered by heavy rains, 40 to 45 mph winds and 25-foot seas, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. At first light Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot spotted what he thought was a man waving from a life raft, but when rescuers reached the raft they found nobody on board, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Three hours later, rescuers spotted another man but, because of choppy seas and floating debris, could not get close enough to tell if he was alive. By the time a rescue helicopter reached him four hours later, the man was floating face down, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer Brandy <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> said. His body was recovered and taken to <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> for post-mortem examination by a state medical examiner. The container ship was one of the three main vessels that bring food and other supplies to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, harbor master in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. The captain of the ship was American and the crew was a mix of nationalities, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Meyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the ship's agent in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> The <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON>, registered in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, made a run to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> every week, and had left <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Tuesday night, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Crafton </PERSON>, an Episcopal priest at the <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who spent Christmas with the men before their ship departed, said most were from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said crew members told him they abandoned ship in two lifeboats, but only one was recovered. Shortly after midnight Wednesday a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet spotted three people in the water waving flashlights. Rescuers aboard the merchant ship Eagle were able to pull two from the water about 1:45 a.m. but the third `` slipped from his life jacket, fell back into the water and was not seen again by his rescuers,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The two men were treated for mild hypothermia but were otherwise unharmed. Their identies were not released. About 4 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> frogmen rescued two more men drifting in the water without life rafts. They were flown by helicopter to <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, but one, who was not identified, was pronounced dead on arrival, apparently of hypothermia, or loss of body heat, a hospital spokeswoman said. The other man, <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Macio-Lopez </PERSON>, 35, was in fair condition and was being treated for hypothermia, spokeswoman <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said.

 Police have seized several large-caliber pistols that could be linked to a suspect accused of killing Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Thursday. The murder weapon has been a key piece of missing evidence in the nearly 3-year-old case. The paper quoted Chief Detective <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Olvebro </PERSON> as saying a number of weapons were test-fired to compare the slugs with those found at the scene of the assassination. Only some were ruled out as the murder weapon, he said. <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 41, the man arrested on Dec. 14, could have had access to the pistols, <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who has a long history of violent crime and of drug and alcohol abuse, was to remain in custody until Friday. Prosecutors said they will seek an extension from the courts.

 An inmate who says the state is turning prisoners into TV addicts failed in a bid to have televisions banned behind bars. `` Wisconsin prisons are chock-full of inmates who are completely addicted to television, soap operas and all,'' <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, an inmate at an Oshkosh prison, said in a letter to The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most male inmates spend almost all their free time watching television.'' Without television, inmates would be more likely to better themselves and `` develop the tools necessary to become productive members of society,'' he said. Warden <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudmanson </PERSON> rejected the complaint filed Nov. 7, and an appeal to the state health and social services secretary also failed. <PERSON> Gudmanson </PERSON> said television has a pacifying influence and gives inmates something to do in their idle time. `` I do n't think the inmates are any more addicted to TV than anyone else in the community. I think watching television is a healthy release,'' <PERSON> Gudmanson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I do n't know of any prison in the country that does n't allow personal televisions.'' About 40 percent of the 400 inmates at <ORGANIZATION> Oshkosh </ORGANIZATION> have personal TV sets, which are permitted as long as the screen is no larger than 13 inches and speakers are disconnected and headphones used. TV sets are also in the prison day rooms. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who is serving a life sentence for murder, taught himself Spanish while behind bars, and his prison job is translating prison manuals into Spanish for Hispanic inmates.

 Predictions ranged from economic disaster to inconvenience as communities speculated Thursday on how they would be affected by a federal commission's recommendation to close or reorganize 145 military installations. For towns whose military bases were spared or even slated to expand, the commission's report brought unalloyed relief. The commission called for closing 34 installations, partially closing five others and reorganizing 54 others that would get new missions and additional personnel. The panel said the measures would save $ 5.6 billion over 20 years. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was the state most affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Base Realignment and Closure report, which recommended that six installations be shut: <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> air force bases, the <ORGANIZATION> Presidio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Test </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. Plans to build <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s Point Naval Station at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> also would be scrapped if the panel's report is approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The closure of Mather will certainly have an adverse economic impact on our community,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salemi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official. `` If you look at an industry that employs close to 7,000 people and has a payroll of $ 154 million, what else can you say?'' The shutdown of <PERSON> George </PERSON>, an air base in the desert 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, would signal hard times for the surrounding communities, where the base contributes an estimated $ 516 million to the economy, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` I would dread the fiscal impact it would have on the entire high desert,'' said Adelanto City Administrator <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlaine </PERSON>. `` We just wo n't survive,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, a longtime employee of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaners </PERSON>, an establishment adjacent to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, that advertises `` 3 <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> For Fatigues And Khakis.'' `` More than 95 percent of our business is <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. If they cut back <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, we'll all be looking for new jobs,'' she said. Similar sentiments echoed through <LOCATION> Wrightstown </LOCATION>'s four-block downtown strip, which begins at the Fort Dix boundary and includes several bars, a tatoo parlor, fast food restaurants, a store called GI <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s and a barber shop that advertises military haircuts. The area also has a high school that is being expanded at a cost of $ 16 million to serve military families, school board President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which has three military installations within its city limits, would lose one, a largely administrative naval station in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, but personnel would simply move to a new base on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> 20 miles away. `` On balance it could have been a lot worse,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, a Republican whose district includes the <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> port. For some, effects of a facility closing were impossible to predict. `` We've never been through one of these,'' said Col. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Siders </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> slated for closing. `` It came as a complete surprise when we heard about it on the radio this morning.'' <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> DePaulis </PERSON> said he was n't surprised the commission recommended closing historic <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, built in 1862 to protect stagecoach travelers and keep watch on Mormon settlers. It had long been criticized as contributing little to the nation's defense. He said the fort, with 44 buildings registered as national historic landmarks, would `` be perfect for an Olympic village'' if the city is selected as host of the 1998 Winter Olympic Games. For many the states, the commission news was a mix of good and bad. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, officials and merchants in <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> were relieved that the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> escaped the budget ax, but <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION> residents lamented the passing of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> facility that has been a neighbor since the War of 1812. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, which oversees development of metals and other materials for use in weapons, armor, bridges and military structures, had long been rumored to be on the verge of closing. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Laye </PERSON>, an employee since 1956, said workers regarded former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> to be the lab's protector. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> retired two years ago. `` We knew it was coming,'' <PERSON> Laye </PERSON> said. `` It's a sad day.'' <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON> residents found that <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION>, also mentioned as a candidate for closing, was instead recommended for enlargement. `` I think we ought to be celebrating today,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, owner of a card shop and a director of the chamber of commerce. `` It's the best news we could have for a New Years.'' In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mapping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Herndon </LOCATION> were recommended for closing, but state leaders were relieved that four larger bases considered vulnerable were untouched: <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vint </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> Farms near <LOCATION> Warrenton </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belvoir </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was recommended for a major expansion. `` I am extremely happy,'' said <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>, a dress shop owner in <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> who had led efforts to save nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>. `` I do n't even care if I sell a dress today.'' She said community leaders would go ahead with plans for a party Thursday night to celebrate the fort's survival.

 A windy and sometimes wet day in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> kept people indoors Thursday, while freezing temperatures did the trick along the nation's northern tier. A cold front brought rain to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, especially along the coast, and warnings of freezing rain and snow were posted inland. At <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, more than an inch and a quarter of rain fell in six hours Thursday morning. In the mountains of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, a winter storm watch was posted for Friday, in anticipation of up to 2 feet of new snow. Farther east, high winds buffeted the eastern slopes of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Wind gusts greater than 80 mph were reported in southeastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowdy </PERSON> State Park near <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, gusty <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds howled again, with advisories posted for mountain areas in the northern part of the region and along the canyons east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Unseasonably cold weather chilled the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> as half a dozen cities reported record low temperatures for the date, including <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where the 20-degree reading broke the record of 23 set in 1966. A freeze warning was posted for part of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> desert. Icy temperatures gripped the northern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> across the Great Lakes region and middle and upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the northern and central Plains. Afternoon readings were in the single digits or below zero across much of the area from eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> The warm spots were <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where it was in the 60s, and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, where it was generally in the 60s and 70s. Snow showers dampened the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> area, while skies were sunny from the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> to the central Plains. Partly cloudy to cloudy skies prevailed elsewhere. The overnight low for the nation was 33 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Hibbing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 2 degrees below zero at <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, to 83 degrees at <LOCATION> Sanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. On Friday, rain and snow were expected to spread from the northern and central Pacific coast to the northern Rockies, with heavy snow possible at higher elevations Light snow was forecast for the north-central states and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region. Showers and thunderstorms were predicted from southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the central Gulf coast into the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, with scattered rain and snow showers <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> along </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.

 If you own a 1988 <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> LeMans, your seat belt buckles may be defective and should be replaced, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday.

There will be no charge for the replacements. `` To our knowledge, no one has yet been injured, but the potential exists for safety belt failure at the worst possible moment,'' said <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>. On Dec. 9, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> recalled about 85,000 of the cars to replace the defective buckles because they may appear to be latched when they are not. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said 46 percent of Americans use safety belts, and the devices saved about 4,000 lives in 1987.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it is requiring tightened security by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers at 103 airports in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including X-ray or physical inspection of all checked baggage and random physical checks of some carry-on baggage. The new measures, coming in the wake of the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 which killed all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, will be effective within 48 hours and `` far exceed existing international standards,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>. Many of the new measures already are being followed, but until now had not been required all the time, he said. The new measures `` may well result in passenger delays and inconvenience,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said, adding that they could mean `` check-in earlier, perhaps as much as an hour.'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said he was `` not at liberty'' to discuss how passengers would be selected for random inspection of hand-baggage or what proportion would be chosen for those inspections. Asked why similar measures were not being required at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told a news conference, `` The threat appears to be more international in scope. We are encouraging our carriers to be more vigilant domestically.'' In addition to the 100 percent inspection of checked baggage and the random inspection of carry-on baggage, here are the main points of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s new program: _ Passengers may not have access to checked baggage after it has cleared security _ Airlines must `` perform positive match'' of passenger and baggage to keep unaccompanied bags off the plane Asked what would happen if a passenger boarded a plane in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a ticket to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but departed the plane at a stop in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of civil aviation, said that person's baggage would have to be removed from the plane in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in accordance with the already required `` reconciliation at the transfer gate'' of the passenger and baggage manifests _ Additional measures will be required to preclude unauthorized access to baggage <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> did not say what these additional measures would be. _ Parcels shipped through passenger ticket counters also must be X-rayed or physically examined _ The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is accelerating by six months the delivery of thermal neutron analysis devices which are capable of detecting all known explosives, even those that are transparent to X-rays such as the plastic explosives favored by terrorists Under the accelerated program, the first unit will be in operation next summer and the last of five, perhaps six, will be operational by the beginning of 1990. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said it had not been decided where to place the thermal neutron equipment, which could go into airports either in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or overseas or a combination of the two. Each unit costs $ 750,000 to $ 1 million. _ The agency's security inspection staff will be increased by 22 percent, from 550 people to 670, over the next 20 months The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had not computed any estimates of additional costs to the airlines for the tightened security arrangements, said agency spokeswoman <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers, said the airline industry will comply fully with the new security initiatives. `` However, more must be done than simply placing additional security requirements on the airlines,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` The government itself must become more directly involved in meeting the threat that international terrorism presents. `` We believe the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should assign more of its security personnel to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. And we believe the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should impose the same security requirements on foreign airlines which serve the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as it imposes on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines,'' he said. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the new measures overlap and duplicate to a certain extent precautions ordered by the British authorities at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that took effect Thursday, and `` are quite similar to the procedures of El Al ... the best in the world.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> is the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> national carrier known for its rigorous security precautions. It has never suffered a midair explosion. In April 1986, an Arab terrorist gave his unsuspecting girlfriend a bomb to carry onto an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> jetliner bound from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The plastic explosive was discovered by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security guard at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> did not anticipate imposing any additional training requirements for security personnel hired by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, domestically or overseas.

 <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> gave his daughter an extra warm hug the last morning of her Christmas visit and told her he would watch her 2-year-old handicapped son, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, while she packed for the trip home. The 75-year-old man then drove off with his only grandson, leaving a note that said only: `` Gramps and <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> have gone bye-bye together.'' On Thursday, two days later, <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> and his grandson were found shot to death in a locked vehicle on wooded, family-owned land 50 miles away, Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. The gun was near the bodies. Both were shot in the head. `` At this point, the evidence appears consistent with a homicide-suicide theory,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. Autopsies were scheduled for Friday. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said she had realized a few hours after her father left with <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> that he may have been saying goodbye forever. `` He told me what a wonderful girl and mother I was,'' she said of the exchange Tuesday. Ms. Day, 40, said she called police a few hours after her father left. `` It's hard to believe he would hurt anybody, much less his grandson, but he'd written me a number of letters, talking about dreams he'd had about flying with <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> into the hereafter,'' Ms. Day said. `` He had a hard time with the fact the boy was such a burden to me. `` He was n't a burden to me because I love him, but he wanted me to be free of this responsibility, which was all-consuming.'' Day had tried to give his daughter some time off, most recently offering to hire a nurse or a nanny for the boy while she went on a Hawaiian vacation. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> was developmentally disabled, his mother said. He could n't walk or talk, and the right side of his body was limp because of palsy <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> was scheduled for cataract surgery Thursday and was anxious about his own future, she said. `` Dad was going to watch my little boy for a few minutes while I packed'' to return home to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> and his father, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Berreth </PERSON>, said Ms. Day. They had been visiting her father, the retired president of a clothing company, and his wife, <PERSON> Uwarda </PERSON>, for Christmas. Instead of watching <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, Day bundled the pajama-clad boy in a coat and hat, loaded the tot into his Jeep Wagoneer and took off. `` My son was beginning to talk. He was doing just fine,'' said Ms. Day, who said <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> was in a hospital therapy program. `` He was a gregarious, outgoing, happy, loving, affectionate child. He was a beautiful child. He had all the support and love of both parents and all of his family members,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said she believes her father was trying to help. `` He was the kind of person who did n't want to be burdened in his own life and did n't want me to be burdened by my child,'' Ms. Day said. `` When you have a handicapped child they're a little bit more work and he thought that having a child like that would be a total altering of my lifestyle that he did n't want to see imposed upon a daughter that he loved dearly. But it was n't in my wildest dreams that he'd do this.'' After Ms. Day called police, law enforcement authorities statewide were alerted. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said a family member called his office Wednesday and asked for a search of the family property near <LOCATION> Packwood </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. `` It was definitely premeditated,'' Ms. Day said before the pair was found. `` He had the car all warmed up and ready to go so he could sneak my little boy out of the house.''

 The Libyan ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> was quoted Thursday as saying <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration may usher in better relations between <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which are at odds over terrorism and chemical warfare. The weekly magazine Realites quoted Ambassador <PERSON> Abdelati </PERSON> <PERSON> Laabidi </PERSON> as saying in an interview that Libyan-U.S. relations may soon `` make a slight improvement'' with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was `` ready for any dialogue which will succeed in opening up better relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' the magazine quoted him as saying. It said <PERSON> Laabidi </PERSON> repeated Libyan denials of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that a remote desert factory is producing chemical arms and insisted the factory makes only medicines. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has threatened military action against the plant. The ambassador said <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> might eventually help mediate the dispute, according to Realites. The ambassador also was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> did not support terrorism but `` would not stop at anything to support the just causes of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, etc.'' Separate guerrilla groups have been fighting to establish a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and to win independence for South African-ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. A U.N.-brokered accord providing for Namibian independence was signed this month.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eighteen people, including six current or former police officers, were indicted Thursday on 1,500 charges in an alleged towing scam that bilked at least 600 people from 1982 to 1987, authorities said. Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 51, head of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police auto theft unit, was charged with six counts of conspiracy, perjury and writing a false police report, according to indictments returned by a <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury. The suspects allegedly participated in several schemes to tow legally and illegally parked cars and overcharge owners who retrieved them, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>. `` I was very disturbed by the arrogance and disrespectful attitude that some police officers had _ a total disregard for the public trust,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> said. `` It really sickens me.'' Also indicted were three other <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officers, one <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> police officer, one former <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police captain, two employees of the city's abandoned car division, two former inspectors at the state Registry of Motor Vehicles, a special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and the owners of two city garages. The defendants face charges ranging from larceny to concealing stolen motor vehicles to perjury, conspiracy and insurance fraud, according to the indictments. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantin </PERSON>, 40, who was indicted on 535 charges, have been suspended without pay, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. Two other indicted officers, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, 44, were put on administrative leave guns pending a departmental hearing, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. The indictments cap a two-year investigation by the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office with help from the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Corruption </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION> police and other law enforcement agencies, officials said. <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said one alleged scheme profited from different charges levied on cars towed by the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police and those towed by the <ORGANIZATION> Registry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>, which charges more to retrieve cars, <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police would tow a car that was parked illegally but the defendants would tell the owner the car had been towed by the registry. Another scheme, <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said, would be to tow a legally parked car and wait several weeks after the owner reported it stolen to collect daily storage charges, often as much as $ 600. He said the scheme affected at least 600 people. The indictment does not say how much money was lost in the alleged schemes.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, citing the need for `` commercial stability,'' on Thursday limited the right of wrongfully fired employees to collect big damage awards. The ruling by the conservative-dominated court moved away from the course the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> judiciary has taken since 1980, when a court then controlled by liberals led the nation in restricting an employer's right to fire at will. The court ruled 4-3 that a worker who is fired without good cause, in violation of a company's express or implied promise, can sue only for reinstatement and back pay, not for emotional distress and punitive damages. `` Initially, predictability of the consequences of actions related to employment contracts is important to commercial stability,'' wrote Chief Justice <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> in the majority decision. `` In order to achieve such stability, it is also important that employers not be unduly deprived of discretion to dismiss an employee by the fear that doing so will give rise to potential tort recovery -LRB- for additional damages -RRB- in every case,'' the opinion said. The court allowed employees to seek additional damages when their firings involved violations of public policy, such as a worker's refusal to break a law Justice <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, who wrote one of three dissenting opinions, accused the majority of `` a radical attempt to rewrite <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law'' in a way that will leave wrongfully fired workers without adequate relief. `` This court is only concerned with stability of the corporation and not the slightest bit with stability of everyday working people,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Palefsky </PERSON>, a lawyer for employees and labor unions. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Schachter </PERSON>, an employers' attorney, said the ruling `` provides a welcome bridle to unwarranted and costly termination claims.'' The ruling reinstates but sharply limits a suit by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who was fired from his $ 56,164-a-year job as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> branch manager of <ORGANIZATION> Interactive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, after telling the company that his boss was being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for embezzlement from a former employer. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> could sue only on the grounds that his encouraging treatment during nearly seven years of employment may have amounted to a promise that he would n't be fired without good cause. Under Thursday's ruling, his damages would be limited to lost pay. Since the court's 1980 ruling allowing wrongful-termination suits, more than 40 other states have allowed some types of claims by fired workers. But few have gone as far as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appellate court rulings allowing emotional distress and punitive damages for workers wrongfully fired. Those rulings were repudiated by the court majority Thursday. Most plaintiffs are managerial employees; union members generally can not sue, but must seek reinstatement through their labor contracts. About 1,000 wrongful-termination suits were filed statewide in 1986; studies have shown employees winning about two-thirds of the cases that go to trial, with damages averaging $ 177,000 for 120 winning plaintiffs in a 1980-86 <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> survey.

 Airline reservations and ticket sales indicate travelers have been undeterred by the bombing last week of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, the carriers said Thursday. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said there has been no appreciable change in ticket sales, reservations or telephone inquiries. `` Business is normal,'' said <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vodopia </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. `` The airline has just come out of what is traditionally our busy holiday period and business was normal and we are entering what is traditionally a slower time, and it has been business as usual for that time too.'' `` We have not seen any effect,'' <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattner </PERSON> agreed. `` This is of course a quiet period,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>, `` and we see no effect on future bookings.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, an airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>, said that while there was no evident change in business during the post-holiday season, he wonders about long-range consequences, particularly for summer vacationers who are more sensitive to safety and economic concerns. `` My guess is that summer'89 travel will not be as good as summer'88 because of those two factors, the weaker dollar and fear of terrorism,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. While the fear of terrorism might deter some discretionary travelers and cause some business travelers to switch to European-based airlines, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said growing fears of poor maintenance and old aircraft might have an even bigger impact on the airline industry. `` In a way, it was good news that it was a bomb and not metal fatigue, because if it was metal fatigue, people really would n't trust the rest of the fleet,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Travel agents say some flyers have voiced concerns about aging jetliners, but not enough to cause cancellations. `` I was booking someone today on Eastern to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> -RRB- and their only question was: ` How old is the airplane?' But they still booked,'' <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Adventure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said Thursday. `` Sophisticated clients know these things happen and that they have no control over it,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, president of JB's <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If they were afraid, they could n't travel.'' It's the infrequent, leisure flyer who is most susceptible to post-crash jitters, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said. `` It's an immediate reaction, but if nothing happens in the next month or two, they'll forget about it, which they always do,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Moratorium Looms As Parliament Rejects Austerity Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> may have to declare a moratorium on foreign debt payments after parliament refused to pass a law the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> demanded for continued financial support, a newspaper said Thursday. The major <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister as saying the government should resign as a result. It said parliament on Wednesday voted against a government austerity law to limit wages in hard-pressed public services such as health and education. Deputies defied warnings from Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> of `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s obligations to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>,'' the newspaper said. Mikulic reportedly said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> insisted on the law before agreeing in June to grant <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> a one-year standby credit of $ 416 million. About $ 260 million of that credit already has been used, according to official statistics. Parliament's decision `` destroys the standby arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, which in turn carries a series of other consequences,'' Borba quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister as saying. `` After this, the government, if it is intelligent enough, should submit its resignation,'' it quoted the minister as saying. The Mikulic government faces widespread public calls to resign or be swiftly replaced because of its inability to resolve <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic and social crisis It is standard practice for the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> to insist on curbing public spending in inflation-ridden countries to reduce the rate of price increases. With unemployment at 15 percent and inflation around 250 percent, the standby loan was designed to help <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> meet payments on its $ 21 billion foreign debt and reach agreements on loan rescheduling with Western creditors. Western commercial banks and governments usually follow the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s lead in judging whether to continue supporting a debtor country The Cabinet minister was quoted as saying parliament's decision `` could endanger the rescheduling of $ 1.6 billion of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s foreign debt falling due next year,'' which had been agreed tentatively with foreign creditors `` If that should happen, according to preliminary estimates, the gross national product would decrease next year by eight percent, thus presenting us with the possibility of declaring a moratorium,'' the Cabinet minister reportedly said. <PERSON> Borba </PERSON> said the Cabinet convened an emergency session immediately after the vote late Wednesday `` to discuss the resulting situation.'' The closed meeting published no statement by Thursday. Meanwhile, thousands of workers in different parts of the country were reported on strike Thursday, protesting low wages and living standards that officially have dropped to mid-1960s levels.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, expressing `` horror'' that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jetliner was downed by a bomb, said Thursday he would `` seek hard and punish firmly'' those responsible, if they can be found. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would be `` imprudent'' for him or any other official to discuss `` what kind of action can be taken'' to retaliate against terrorists. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been secluded at a 10,000-acre south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranch hunting quail for three days, said he had no other information than what was in the `` public domain'' about the bomb that blew up a <LOCATION> Pan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last week. The crash killed 259 passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground. The vice president made his comments as he left <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, headed for <LOCATION> Pintala </LOCATION>, about 15 miles from <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent a few hours here fishing for bass on a private 55-acre lake owned by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportsman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and founder of Bassmasters. `` Oh-oh ... real trouble,'' the president-elect said as he snagged a tree by mistake. But, casting from the back of a boat, he caught a two-pound fish a few minutes later. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caught nine fish by the end of the day, the largest of which weighed three pounds, and he threw them all back, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> The president-elect arrived back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the evening. Asked about the British investigators' conclusion that a bomb destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he felt `` horror'' at the finding. Pressed by reporters on what action should be taken, he responded, `` Seek hard and punish firmly, decisively those who did this, if you can ever find them.'' He added: `` When I say punish severely, that's what I mean.'' Despite his tough rhetoric, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged that stopping terrorism was virtually impossible. `` When you're dealing with something as cowardly as that it's almost impossible to guarantee there will never be another terrorism act,'' he said `` Unfortunately, we've seen that happen several times.'' To stop terrorist acts, officials need to `` continue and step up'' anti-terrorism policies, including improved intelligence and heightened worldwide awareness to the problem, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. As vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed a presidential task force on terrorism, and he referred to that role Thursday. `` We have a fine anti-terrorism policy,'' he said. `` I take great pride in having coordinated ... the anti-terrorism report and setting high standards for people around the world,'' he said. At <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a few minutes to mount a restored <ORGANIZATION> TBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenger </ORGANIZATION>, a torpedo bomber like the one he flew on World War II missions over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Clutching a white marking pen, he signed and underlined his wife's name, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, just below the cockpit. He then wrote, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' All of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s planes during were named for the vice president's then-fiancee, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> The plane will be transported to the <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Naval Air Station for display. Attending the ceremony was <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s regular tail gunner on bombing missions <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON>'s name and that of his wife, <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON>, also were written on the plane. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his annual hunting trip was enjoyable, particularly the exercise from walking. The shooting was n't up to past years, though. `` The drought, I think, caught up with the quail this year.'' The hunting party shot about 10 birds a day instead of the usual 30 to 40, he said. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoys most outdoor sports, he said fishing is his favorite. In fact, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the vice president planned another two-day fishing trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> before the Jan. 20 inauguration, possibly over the Martin Luther King Birthday holiday. The next trip will be to <LOCATION> Islamorada </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, about 75 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. During this stay at the Lazy F Ranch, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and his fellow hunter and nominee for secretary of state, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, discussed some `` personnel matter'' as well as policies after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is sworn in. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will `` finish the Cabinet, start fleshing out the -LRB- deputy -RRB- secretary and undersecretary levels and, most important, formulating definitive plans for the first 100 days.'' He said he is `` fairly close'' to naming an energy secretary and a drug czar, the two Cabinet-level posts that remain vacant. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't know if he would make any personnel announcements Friday, but his aides indicated that was a possibility.

<HEAD>$250,000 Bail for Alleged Drunken Driver Unlicensed Since 1983</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man with 10 drunken driving convictions who lost his license for the offense in 1983 had his bail set at $ 250,000 Thursday in a new drunken driving case. The bail for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> was raised from $ 15,000 at the request of a deputy of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>, who called the defendant a hazard to the community. `` This is a blatant example of the kind of driver we must keep off the roads and freeways, especially over the holiday weekend, for the safety of other drivers,'' <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said. Municipal Court Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> jailed when he could n't post the bond on new misdemeanor charges. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> was arrested Oct. 2 after a breath test showed his blood alcohol level was .27 percent, nearly triple the legal maximum of .10 percent, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Albergate </PERSON>, the district attorney's spokesman. He is charged with drunken driving and with driving on a revoked license. Since 1981, he has been convicted 10 times of drunken driving, and has been sentenced twice to the maximum one-year term, <PERSON> Albergate </PERSON> said. His license was revoked in 1983 on one such conviction, the spokesman said, adding that he did n't know how much time <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> has served on the various convictions. In six of his convictions, <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>'s blood alcohol level registered .28 percent or higher, according to the prosecutor on the case, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernsberger </PERSON>. `` I've never seen anything like it,'' <PERSON> Hernsberger </PERSON> said. `` What's amazing is that he has n't killed somebody.

<HEAD>Judge to Hear Antitrust Suit Against Miami News Closure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge agreed Thursday to hear arguments in a last-ditch lawsuit seeking to stop the closing of The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, but the 93-year-old daily's publisher still planned to stop the presses Saturday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> scheduled a hearing Friday afternoon on a lawsuit by community newspapers, readers and News distributors contending that closing the News would violate antitrust laws. The lawsuit is based on the joint operating agreement between the News' owner, Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under the planned shutdown, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> would continue to pay a share of profits to <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>, the plaintiffs said. `` It is incredible what they've done, which is to pay a competitor not to operate,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. `` It's the same as <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> paying <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> not to build cars.'' A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newspaper consultant representing a group negotiating to buy the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said he was still working on a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's close,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> `` We are proceeding ahead with what <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> wants.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> had failed to come up with money <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> required to keep the paper open pending the sale. <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON> said if the <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> deal falls through, he has no other offers and will shut the paper down Saturday as scheduled. The antitrust lawsuit filed Wednesday lists as plaintiffs <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes more than a dozen community newspapers in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>; two <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> readers and six independent News distributors. The lawsuit asks for an injunction barring <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, from shutting down the News or selling it without profit-sharing rights under the joint operating agreement. <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> will contest the lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON> said Thursday that her company feels the lawsuit had no merit and incorrectly implies that <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> was involved in the decision to shut down the News. The complaint, which seeks in excess of $ 500 million in punitive damages, alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> `` conspired to monopolize the market'' for daily newspapers in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and that the plaintiffs will suffer `` irreparable injury'' if the News closes. The lawsuit contends the deal triggering the closing of the News conflicts with the Newspaper Preservation Act, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed in 1970 to save failing newspapers and competing editorial voices by allowing the opposing papers to combine their business operations. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials already are independently investigating the planned shutdown or sale of the News for possible antitrust law violations. Federal officials have refused to discuss the status of their probe.

<TEXT>
 Less than 10 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would be willing to pay a higher federal income tax to reduce the national deficit, but most believe President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will ask for one, according to a newspaper poll released Thursday. The nationwide survey of 611 adults _ conducted for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> which will publish the complete results in Friday's editions _ showed only 9 percent of Americans favor a tax hike to reduce the national deficit, but 75 percent say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is somewhat or very likely to seek one. However, higher percentages of Americans would favor raising taxes on gas, alcohol and tobacco if the money were earmarked solely to reduce the government's red ink. Fifty-six percent would favor a higher gasoline tax and 83 percent a higher tax on alcohol and tobacco. Most of those surveyed _ 72 percent _ say the way to cut the deficit is to reduce government spending, with defense spending singled out by 50 percent as the category most easily targeted for cutting. The poll, conducted Dec. 14-16, had a 4 percent margin or error.

<TEXT>
 Two federal courts cleared way Thursday for the setting of a statewide date for election of trial judges, delayed for years by lawsuits charging racial discrimination. State Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the court action would end the `` piecemeal fashion'' in which <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> voters elect chancery and circuit judges by allowing one general election on June 20 in which blacks would have a fair chance of being elected. `` Now, I do n't think <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is discriminatory and I think it is time we stood up and showed it,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. No black has been elected a judge in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> without first being appointed. As a result, blacks challenged judicial election practices in lawsuits filed in 1984 and 1985, and some judges whose terms expired have remained in office awaiting court action on an election date. The action Thursday involved the signing of final drafts of proposed orders in two separate courts, officials said. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, a lawyer in <LOCATION> Hazlehurst </LOCATION> who represents black plaintiffs in the four-year-old lawsuit, said an agreement had been reach to allow federal courts in both <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to move quickly to close out all pending cases and appeals dealing with the election of chancery and circuit judges. Under the agreement, primary elections will be held statewide April 4 for the judgeships, with the general election on June 20, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said. Earlier, elections in about half the districts had been scheduled in February and April. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> signed an order delaying until June elections that would have been held in February in 21 districts that have not voted for judges since 1982. Under a settlement of a racial bias lawsuit already worked out by <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON>, 13 blacks had filed in those districts before a Dec. 9 deadline. Attorneys said under the agreement, filing would not be reopened in the 21 districts. The other court that signed an order Thursday was a panel of three federal judges meeting in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and led by the chief judge of the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. It tentatively accepted settlement of a similar redistricting lawsuit in which election of judges post-by-post instead of districtwide was challenged as designed to dilute the voting strength of blacks. The plan calls for redrawing 19 eastern districts to allow multijudge elections, with a Feb. 28 qualifying deadline, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said. He said that with all candidates running in one districtwide election, blacks could concentrate their voting strength on one candidate, a technique called single-shot voting that has helped minorities elsewhere. The state attorney general's office said the qualifying deadline for the 19 districts would be scheduled to allow the Legislature time to adopt the redistricting, which must be approved first by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under the 1965 Voting Rights Act. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he expected rapid approval because federal representatives participated in negotiations, in which the state pushed for the cost-saving uniform election date and gave in on opposing the multijudge redistricts. `` This is something new for <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and I think it shows there is progressive leadership in the state,'' said <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>. `` I just hope this progressive leadership will continue and this will not be the end of it.''

<TEXT>
 A group of Cuban intellectuals on Thursday sharply criticized a proposal by more than 100 writers, artists, and scientists living abroad that President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> hold a referendum on extending his rule. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Retamar </PERSON>, a longtime supporter of <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> who heads a cultural center in this city, said the appeal was tainted because it likened <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s situation to that of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was defeated last October in a yes-or-no vote on extending his 15-year rule. Speaking at a news conference with four other intellectuals, <PERSON> Retamar </PERSON> rejected the comparison and called <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> an `` assassin.'' A Foreign Ministry spokesman made a similar criticism earlier this week when he was quoted as rejecting the proposal. <PERSON> Retamar </PERSON> said many who signed the open letter asking for a referendum `` would applaud the establishment of a fascist regime in the entire world.'' <PERSON> Abriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prito </PERSON>, an essayist at the news conference, said such a plebiscite is unnecessary because few societies have undergone a period of self-examination as profound as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has over the past two years. He said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has carried out perhaps `` the purest revolution in history.'' Those who signed the open letter to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> asking for the referendum come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The appeal was also signed by about 50 Cubans exiles. The letter was made public earlier this week as <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> prepares to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Cuban revolution on Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas said Thursday they killed or wounded 7,932 soldiers this year and a human rights group said 1,747 civilians died in that time in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war. A report on the rebels' Radio Venceremos gave no breakdown of dead and wounded. Nor did it say how many guerrillas were killed. It claimed the guerrillas, from the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, caused $ 3 million in property damage through sabotage attacks, including those on numerous military installations. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> said 1,747 civilians were killed in violent conflicts this year and 231 civilians were reported missing. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON> told a news conference the numbers were up from last year, when the group reported 1,415 civilians killed and 204 missing. The head of the military's <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, recently said the army killed 914 guerrillas and wounded 702 in 1988. Like the rebels, the military did not mention its own casualties. However, the military said it suffered a combined total of 2,039 deaths and injuries between June 1987 and May 1988. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> condemned violence from both the left and right late Wednesday after returning from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he underwent an evaluation of chemotherapy he is receiving for terminal liver cancer. His successor, to be chosen in presidential elections in March, must seek an end to the 9-year conflict, he said. `` If not, we are going to bring the country to a moment of gigantic confrontations,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. `` We must seek the path of tolerance and comprehension.'' About 65,500 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the war between rebels and U.S.-backed governments since 1979.

 A 35-year-old hospital porter was charged with conspiracy and withholding information about terrorism `` regarding <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> affairs'' after police uncovered a bomb factory in a south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> said Thursday. In <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a bomb planted by the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> exploded Thursday night under a policeman's car outside his home, police said. The bomb, containing about three pounds of explosives, destroyed the car but the officer was inside his home with his family and no one was hurt, they said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility in a message to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> news organizations. Many police officers live in <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> seaside resort 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard identified the hospital porter as <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadley </PERSON> of north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and said police arrested him on Dec. 22, the day after the arsenal was found in the <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> area. A brief <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard statement gave no arrest details and did not indicate any link with two fugitive <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects being sought by police in connection with the arsenal. Police found the haul after an incident in which an 18-year-old man was shot in the stomach after breaking the window of a car parked outside the apartment. Authorities say a man inside the car, a suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member, apparently was asleep or keeping watch in the back seat when the would-be thief tried to break in. A police sweep resulted and officers reported finding a cache of Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosive, often used by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>; machine guns; rifles; handguns and bomb-making equipment. Police say they believe two fugitive <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects rented the apartment recently. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, police said soldiers and police on Thursday found a 4OO-pound bomb hidden in a stone wall near the main Belfast-Dublin railroad line in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. A spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice, said the explosives _ in eight bags and primed for use _ were found about 250 yards from where a Dec. 16 bomb damaged rail track at <LOCATION> Kilnasaggart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. The bomb apparently was intended for security forces moving about the area after the bridge attack. `` We were expecting a booby trap of some sort,'' said the spokesman. No claim of responsibility was advanced. Suspicion, however, fell on the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which uses explosives widely in its battle to drive the British from the Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the overwhelmingly <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to the south.

 Harrods and 65 sister department stores will stop selling aerosols that damage the Earth's ozone shield, the store chain announced Thursday. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraser </ORGANIZATION> chain that owns Harrods, said he hoped other businesses and industries would follow suit. `` The preservation of the environment is the responsiblity of every one of us,'' he said.

The treaty goes into effect Jan. 1. Chlorofluorocarbon compounds in aerosols are one of a number of non-toxic chemicals that can last for more than a century in the atmosphere. They rise slowly to the ozone layer, 15-25 miles high, where their chlorine atoms destroy ozone. The ozone layer protects the Earth's surface from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Other damaging chemicals that destroy the ozone layer include refrigeration fluids, foam-blowing agents, and cleaning solvents.

<HEAD>Judge Questions Jurors About Copper 7 Damage Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge questioned jurors Thursday to determine if a $ 8.15 million damage award against the <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> drug firm should be overturned because of possible jury misconduct. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> won the award in September after a three-month trial and almost 10 days of jury deliberations. The verdict supported her claim that a Searle Copper-7 intrauterine birth control device had triggered a pelvic infection that left her infertile. But three of the eight jurors later signed affidavits alleging they were the victims of verbal harassment and intimidation and had been bullied into an `` unjust'' verdict. The affidavits also said newspaper accounts of the trial had been smuggled into the jury room along with information from a medical dictionary. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> had specifically told the jurors not to discuss the case, read about it or consult medical dictionaries. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> questioned the jurors one at a time. He did not say when he would issue a ruling. Under federal law, the hearing could not delve into the process of deliberations, including the allegations of intimidation, but only into evidence of improper outside influence. In an interview following the hearing, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Strain </PERSON>, said the jurors' testimony definitely points to misconduct. `` The record of misconduct is even more extensive than we thought,'' including one juror discussing the case with a relative who is a doctor, <PERSON> Strain </PERSON> said. `` What is striking is the tremendous degree of use of extraneous, prejudicial information,'' he said. `` It clearly infected the entire deliberative process.'' <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, said there is no basis to <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s motion to impeach the verdict. <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> and other lawyers for <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> had complained in a previous, open hearing that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> refuses to accept its defeat and is trying to retry the case outside the court room. `` I did n't believe there was any basis for the motion before the hearing. And I do n't believe anything happened during the hearing to change that opinion,'' <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Indeed, what took place during the hearing supported the plaintiff's -LRB- <LOCATION> Kociemba </LOCATION>'s -RRB- position.'' The Kociemba verdict was the first time punitive damages had been awarded against Chicago-based <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> over the Copper-7 and <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> said the verdict was a victory not only for <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, but for the more than 500 women who have suits pending against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> over the IUD.

 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> shurgged off calls for his resignation on Thursday and struck back at the opposition and press in the face of widening financial scandals that are rocking his Socialist government. Addressing 140 members of his party's central committee, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> also spurned demands for immediate elections. He said general elections would be held in June 1989, as scheduled. `` I repeat, with even greater emphasis this time, that I will remain in active politics,'' he said during an hourlong speech at an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> hotel. Both conservative and Communist opposition parties have united in demanding <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s resignation and immediate elections. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said Thursday his <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was going through its worst crisis since he founded it in 1974, and accused opposition parties of plotting to undermine the government. `` We do not have the right to remain passive and defensive against the deterioration of <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> which is being pursued,'' said the 69-year-old premier. Popular support for <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> has been eroding following a series of multimillion-dollar financial scandals. Most of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s usually pro-government press has chided the governing party. The latest scandal involves the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by a state-owned operation. Finance Minister <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsovolas </PERSON> denied newspaper allegations that he and <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> gave the state-owned arms industry permission to pay kickbacks to foreign arms dealers. Another scandal is swirling around the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> and its ousted chairman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>. He is accused of fraud or embezzlement involving millions of dollars, and his ties to government leaders have created an embarrassment. Seven ministers have quit over the scandal. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> accused the domestic press Thursday of orchestrating `` an unhealthy and destabilizing climate by creating forged, fabricated and unfounded stories.'' In an effort to shore up his government, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> threatened to resign earlier in the month and asked <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for a vote of confidence during debate on the 1989 budget. The deficit budget was approved by a narrow margin.

 A state communications company on Thursday ordered a radio station run by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to operate at one-tenth power, a move that opposition leaders called harassment. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> news director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the order from <ORGANIZATION> ANTELCO </ORGANIZATION>'s department of radio communications limits how far the station can broadcast. It had been reaching most populated areas in this rural country of 3.5 million, but now is difficult to hear outside this capital city. The station has been one of the most popular and independent in the country. <ORGANIZATION> ANTELCO </ORGANIZATION> offered no explanation for its order, but foes of President Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> said it was a warning to the station. Radio <PERSON> Caritas </PERSON> was blocked this week from broadcasting a panel discussion featuring politicians and economists from outside the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 Rebels offered to renew peace talks with the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Jan. 25, a leader of the Nicaraguan Resistance said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. But `` if the Sandinista government does not reach a peace accord, the Nicaraguan Resistance will be obligated to renew the war,'' <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said in a tape recording played for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> is a director of the political organization of the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras. Radio Liberation reporter <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> played the recording during a telephone call to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON> said on Tuesday that the government is ready to resume talks with the Contras. Efforts to reach government spokesmen following the rebel announcement Thursday were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said the proposed talks would renew negotiations that broke down in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in June. An attempt to resume talks in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> failed in September. He said the rebels will give a copy of the peace proposal to Central American presidents on Jan. 3. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> suggested the talks be held at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Agreements reached in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> last March established a 60-day cease-fire that has been renewed several times. This month, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> unilaterally extended the cease-fire until next June and the rebels said they would support the continued truce. However, minor armed confrontations have continued. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday that Honduran soldiers attacked Sandinista border guards in eastern <LOCATION> Chinandega </LOCATION> province, firing M-16 rifles from Honduran territory. It did not say when the alleged attack took place. In the Honduran capital, <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile announced Thursday that less than half the 104 Nicaraguan prisoners released by the Contras on Honduran territory on Dec. 23 had returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Others said they want to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said ministry spokesman <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. He said 44 former prisoners crossed the border from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manos </LOCATION>. Those who did not return will remain in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> while awaiting visas, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. The Contras said the 96 men and eight women, some of them Sandinista troops, were captured a year ago during battles in the Nicaraguan provinces of Chontales, <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Madriz </PERSON>. On Dec. 20, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would not let armed groups hold prisoners illegally in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 Seven of 115 complaints of police misconduct stemming from a riot at a park on a hot August night have been forwarded for departmental trial, a civilian review board said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complaint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it has taken up 22 of the 115 complaints, and has recommended to Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> that departmental trials be held for six officers on seven allegations of brutality. At least 52 officers and 18 civilians required hospital treatment for injuries received during the Aug. 7 riot at Tompkins Square Park. A police chief accused of poor supervision resigned and two policemen were indicted this month on assault charges. Most of the complaints not forwarded to the commissioner were dropped for lack of substantiation, with complainants failing to follow up their allegations, the board said in an interim report. `` Everyone's going to be disappointed about this investigation,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reppetto </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group that monitors crime in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Civilian Complaint Review Boards around the country tend to be very legalistic, that's the way they have to be,'' <PERSON> Reppetto </PERSON> added. `` That has a tendency to disappoint people who thought a civilian review board was going to work a miracle.'' The report expressed frustration that no police officers had volunteered evidence. `` Here you've got over 100 complaints in the presence of 400 police officers and 40 sergeants over a period of about six hours in about a six-block area and no police officer has come forward to either defend one of his fellow officers or to provide evidence that one of these things happened,'' board member <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> accused the Policeman's <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of recommending officers not cooperate, which police union President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON> denied. Chairwoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> said the board would hear 27 more complaints on Jan. 18 and should resolve the rest by February. She said at the news conference that of the 15 cases closed without disciplinary charges, eight were dropped because complainants or victims were uncooperative or unavailable. Three other complaints were withdrawn, two were found to be outside the board's jurisdiction, one was unsubstantiated and one was closed because the officer could not be identified, the report said. `` In my judgment, we're going to end up with a large number of cases where we believe the abuse occurred, and where we ca n't identify the officer,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> Videotapes taken by residents showed that several officers covered their badges with dark tape to keep from being identified. The melee between police and demonstrators was sparked by enforcement of a curfew in Tompkins Square Park. The park, in a <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> neighborhood called the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, is a gathering place for musicians, drug dealers, homeless people and teen-agers. Its neighbors range from squatters to owners of luxury condominiums, the latter group favoring the curfew.

 While X-ray machines are severely limited in keeping modern explosives off airliners, researchers say they have developed a device that can detect bombs inside luggage with uncanny regularity. But no airline has ordered one of the devices, and with the exception of two prototype machines used in a yearlong test program in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, no airports have put the machine into operation. The disclosure Wednesday that a bomb detonated aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet last week over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard, is likely to spur interest in the new explosives detection device, industry officials said. The machine goes by the name of Termal Neutron Analysis device, or <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION>, and is about twice the size of an airport X-ray machine. During the yearlong test under a contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> it demonstrated a 95 percent detection rate with few false alarms, the agency said.

 Studies of nearly 29,000 breast-cancer patients leave no doubt that drug and hormone therapies improve chances of surviving the disease, the second-leading cancer killer of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women, researchers say. Analysis of 61 studies showed that a synthetic hormone called tamoxifen improves the survival of breast cancer victims over age 50, while chemotherapy helps younger women. During the first five years after treatment, tamoxifen reduced the odds of death among older women by about one-fifth, the analysis revealed, while a combination of chemotherapy drugs reduced the odds by about one-quarter for younger victims. The studies were started as far back as 20 years ago.

 Suggestion: All the blame for the `` economic illiteracy'' so widespread in the American populace should not fall on the nation's schools. It is not just in the classroom that economics is shrouded in ignorance, mystery and superstitution, but also in politics and government, in the workplace and in the shopping mall, and just about everywhere else you care to look. For example, when congressmen discuss the state of the economy with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, emotion and political prejudices often overshadow the whole debate. Legislators are wont to charge that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is heedlessly hurting their constituents by setting interest rates too high. A <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> official counters by declaring that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does n't set interest rates, market forces do. And interest rates would be a lot lower if only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stopped voting for inflationary spending programs and balanced its budget for a change. Ordinary citizens may not have been given much schooling on the factors that determine interest rates, or on the workings of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. But they may quickly come to the conclusion that both sides in this argument are engaged in some self-serving posturing. The results of an economics test given to more than 8,000 high school students made a lot of headlines when they were made public the other day. Fewer than half of the students, it was reported, showed a grasp of such basic economic concepts as inflation and the gross national product. `` Our schools are producing a nation of economic illiterates,'' said one of the study's authors. Some of the sample questions from the test were not as simple as they looked, though, if you consider the emotional baggage that comes with so many basic economic terms. One multiple-choice item, for instance, called for a definition of `` profits.'' By the time they reach high school, how many Americans have not heard that word used as a pejorative? Would the question have read the same if the test-takers were asked to define `` earnings of a business'' or `` net income?'' If economic ignorance begins in the schools, a case can certainly be made that it is perpetuated by the pillars of capitalism as it is practiced in this country. The bank that gives away `` free'' toaster ovens to new depositors rather than promoting competitive interest rates is doing nothing to further the cause of enlightenment. And the `` greed is good'' school of financiers on Wall Street hardly proved their case when several of them went to prison. Many honest business people also reinforce ignorance and suspicion about the free enterprise system by talking in euphemisms and defensive generalities about what they do at work. Consider the stock market. Of what social benefit is this institution, prone as it is to menacing the rest of the economy with wild and unpredictable swings? When this question is put to Wall Street leaders, they typically invoke phrases like `` corporate democracy'' and `` capital formation.'' Nobody seems comfortable enough to acknowledge that the market is a machine driven by individuals' hunger for wealth, designed to harness the vast amount of energy created by that hunger, and to put it to as much general social benefit as possible. Whether it serves that function as well as it might, of course, is a separate question. If it is worthy of its place in the system, it could certainly stand up to the scrutiny of a well-informed society of economic literates. It might even benefit from that scrutiny by gaining a little respect.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> hangs out on the subway platform defiantly chain-smoking, a tough customer in leather and denim. Other commuters give her wide berth. Anybody can see she's looking for trouble. And when it arrives _ often in groups of teen-age thugs who victimize people in and around subway stations _ <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> wants nothing more than to get in the thick of it. For the last three months, that's been her job. As part of an elite, 23-officer plainclothes unit of the transit police known as the Repeat Offender Robbery Strike Force, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and her partner, Officer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanti </PERSON>, spend hours loitering around subway stations, waiting for crime to happen and trying to ensure that the subway offers no escape. So far, the unit has chalked up 42 arrests, and <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> is responsible for eight of those. `` I especially get satisfaction out of robbery arrests,'' said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 26, who at 5-foot-4 and 110 pounds, has had to push around perpetrators twice her size. `` A lot of bad guys show no remorse and do n't think twice about taking people's property and leaving them injured and bleeding. We try to get the best possible case so they do time.'' One evening during the busy Christmas shopping season, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fanti </PERSON> spent hours following a group of teen-agers as they tried to rob a shopper at <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, wandered in and out of the subway and nearby stores and finally made a grab for racks of clothes from one shop. Four of the would-be shoplifters ended up in handcuffs, and <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> suffered a bruised knee in the struggle. She knows that violence comes with the job, but it is a job she always has wanted to do. `` When I was growing up, I always thought cops were heros,'' said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a 3 -LCB- - year veteran of the transit police who hopes to become a detective `` Now I want to make a difference for my son.

<TEXT>
 The jury is still out on <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but history is likely to regard him as an average to good president, according to some scholars of the presidency. With little time left in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final term, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interviewed eight presidential scholars including specialists in history, political science and social psychology. Their tentative verdict: <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will get high marks for his use of the White House pulpit to unite the country and will get credit for improving East-West relations even though Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have been more responsible for it than he. `` My view is that he will be viewed by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people as an above-average president,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, a historian of the presidency at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> who calls himself a moderate Democrat. `` I think the historians and biographers will treat him a little bit more harshly, still ranking him at least an average president but not as high as the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people now do or will.'' But <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who is critical of many <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies, said, `` I think, in the historical sense, somewhere down the road, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be considered as a somewhat worse than average president because of the problems that he has left us.'' If the economy turns sour in the wake of his administration's record budget and trade deficits, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may go down in history like <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> as a president who failed to take action to stave off coming disaster Some scholars said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reputation will also suffer from scandals in his administration and from his failure to deal effectively with such social ills as the plight of the homeless. `` I think probably in the short range reaction in the next five or 10 years, even liberal and radical historians will find something good to say about him and that will be that he somehow represented a kind of quality of Americanism and a sense of national unity and he projected that from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Belz </PERSON>, a neo-conservative historian at the University of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` Whether or not in the long run our relations with the Soviets will be so good that people will always say it started in the fall of 1988 under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> I do n't know, but it would certainly look that way,'' said <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bornet </PERSON>, professor emeritus of history at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a self-described moderate Republican. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, a conservative historian at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said it is too early to evaluate <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But, echoing many of his academic colleagues, he said, `` The deficit does bother me. The deficit does bother me.'' `` I think we can say history will probably look most kindly upon him not necessarily for any substantive policy changes that he brought about but for the tone that he brought to the office and for a renewed sense of national pride,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional aide who teaches political science at <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and has written widely on the presidency. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said, `` On just the externalities of it, I think <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, with one huge ` if,' will probably go down as one of the most successful ones certainly in this century and maybe ever.'' However, comparing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with one of the predecessors the president most admires, <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON> also said that `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may go down in history pretty much the way <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> did'' if some economists' predictions of economic collapse come true `` Coolidge is not seen now as a successful president followed by <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, a bum, but as a president whose do-nothing policies led to the huge crash of the early'30s that <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> was the victim of,'' he said. Dean <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON>, a professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> who has devised a formula for predicting how history will rate presidents, said, `` When you put all the pros and all the cons in the equation, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> comes out as a slightly above average president.'' One of the `` pro'' factors for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON>, is the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have forged. `` He gets nice points for that in foreign policy when actually he did n't take the initiative for that,'' <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON> said. `` In all fairness, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deserves more credit than he does,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` Still,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bornet </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stepped forward as usual and managed to pin it on himself and that's going to be hard to erase, I'll tell you.'' <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, similarly, argued, `` A good leader also must seize the opportunity, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered an opportunity to play for high stakes in the international arena. He seized that; he was not frozen in place by rigid ideology, and thus I think one has to give him credit.'' From <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ranny </PERSON> said the relaxation of East-West tensions was the most important of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s accomplishments in foreign policy. `` Now you might say that's because he got lucky and had <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> there, and I would n't quarrel with that,'' he said. `` Nevertheless, it did happen. And I think when historians look back at that, they will say that he was in terms of foreign policy one of the most successful postwar presidents that we have had.'' Psychologist <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON> said one big factor working in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s favor is the simple fact that he was the first president since <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to serve eight years `` The longer you serve the more events happen that can be credited to you, whether or not you are responsible for them,'' he said. `` You make a thick chapter in the history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> under your name.'' Although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recently pictured himself as the adversary of a `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> colony'' protecting special interests at the expense of ordinary citizens, some scholars argued that one of his own chief shortcomings is his failure to be an advocate for those on the outside.

 `` There will be a feeling that he was largely indifferent to those without voice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that he responded much more to upper middle class and middle class <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` The presidency ought to be a place which raises its voice on behalf of those who do n't have the powerful lobbies.'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> is self-described as a Democrat with a liberal viewpoint compared with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, but the more conservative <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> agreed, `` I also think <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could perhaps have done more for the homeless.'' The Iran-Contra affair and the investigations and indictments that have marked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration also will cast their shadow, the scholars said. `` The people will forget that quickly; the historians wo n't,'' said <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` The historians will have chapters on the sleaze stuff and they'll call it as bad or equal to the Watergate mess.'' Some who praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> highly on other grounds conceded he was not as attentive as he should have been to his duties. `` He did n't keep his ear to the ground enough and he did n't have enough interest in political life, the warp and woof of it, to do as good a job as he could have,'' said the neo-conservative <PERSON> Belz </PERSON>. In strikingly similar language, <PERSON> Ranny </PERSON> said, `` I imagine he loses a few points because of the large number of scandals and indictments and things like that,'' and <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON> said that `` he is probably going to get some negative points'' because of such troubles. In comparing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with past presidents, scholars cited the names ranging from <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` Personality and character issues for 20 years have overwhelmed evaluation of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as president and if that's any precedent, then maybe for several decades it will be difficult to get down to serious business with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bornet </PERSON>, who has written extensively on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, he said, `` is still the crude, cornpone president, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is going to continue to be for a long time this image people watched on TV and this person the press correctly portrayed as essentially a lazy president.'' As for <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, he has undergone a re-evaluation in recent years, with scholars believing him a much more activist president than first believed. <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON> said, `` If future scholarship finds out that behind the scenes and when the truth is known <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> himself was also a much more hands-on active president than we now believe _ and incidentally it is unlikely that they will find that _ he might undergo the same kind of upgrading.'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, however, said, `` Definitely a comparison of <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is in order. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> had a very subtle style of leadership that evidently caused him to lead more effectively than most people thought he was leading. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s leadership I do n't think will come off as that kind of subtle hidden hand leadership so much as it has been leadership through orchestration of symbols and movement of the public mind.'' On the other hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> political scientist said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may also be in for the kind of scaling down of his reputation that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has suffered as the force of his personality recedes. `` There is no longer the Camelot mystique to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>; a lot of that has worn off,'' he said. `` I suspect that with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> there will be a little bit of wearing off of the mystique that surrounds him.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s lawless young life was already careening out of control by the time the 12-year-old struck and killed two people with a stolen car while trying to outrun the cops. `` I knew sooner or later there was going to be an accident,'' said <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, the 72-year-old great-grandmother who raised the boy from infancy after his unwed parents abandoned him. `` I knew he was going to do the wrong thing.'' Now, she said, `` There's nothing I can say but cry.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a wisp his family called <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>, admitted responsibility for the Oct. 24 deaths of a father of nine children and an 11-year-old girl. He's now serving four years at a maximum security lockup for juveniles in rural northeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He was a street-savvy career criminal before age 10, when his first arrest was recorded _ for stealing $ 327 from under his great-grandmother's pillow. His family said he was stealing bicycles years before that. His rap sheet includes 13 arrests, five for stealing cars, in the last two years. He escaped five times from minimum-security juvenile homes, committing more crimes every time he hit the streets. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>, who turned 13 on Dec. 12, was on the loose at the time of his fatal joyride, although he was supposed to be under watch, awaiting placement in a secure state lockup that was too crowded to take him right away. How could a boy so young get into so much trouble? Why did n't anybody stop him A litany of failure offers clues: a broken home, a guardian too old to keep up with <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>, lack of resources in a social services system that should have intervened before things got out of control and an overcrowded juvenile justice system ill-equipped for criminals so young. `` We normally do n't get kids that young in that kind of trouble,'' said <PERSON> Mingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroeber </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Defender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION>, which handled the case. `` There are very few programs equipped to deal with kids that young. Nobody seemed to know what to do with him,'' Miss <PERSON> Stroeber </PERSON> said. `` These kids are victims. His family failed him. The dependent child system failed him. The juvenile court system failed him. We as a society failed.'' Others labeled him incorrigible. `` There are bad seeds. I've never seen one like this. He had no appreciation for Western values,'' said Family Court Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> exudes a peculiar combination of street-smart toughness and moppet charm. Prosecutors consider him a corrupt man-child who manipulates people to get his way. His lawyers thought him lovable enough to adopt. He caused a crash that killed two people, then asked for crayons and a coloring book in jail. He bought flowers and cards for his great-grandmother on Mother's Day, then swiped her cash as she slept He could steal a car in seconds, but because he stands just 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds, he had to sit on umbrellas, jackets and other makeshift booster seats to help him see over the steering wheel. Today, when most boys his age are in junior high school, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is living behind 12-foot-high chain-link fences topped with barbed wire at the North Central Treatment Facility in <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>'s lifetime of trouble began just months after he was born He was given to his paternal great-grandmother by a mother who did n't want him and a father who is a confessed murderer. <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> raised him as best she could in the nasty <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> neighborhood. His father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 32, pleaded guilty in October to third-degree murder for stabbing his girlfriend, who he said had been unfaithful. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was also charged with attempted murder in 1977 and with robbery, conspiracy and drunken driving in 1982. No one knows what happened to his mother, <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. She is believed dead, possibly murdered, and may have spent time in a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> prison, according to fragments gleaned from 12 interviews with acquaintances and authorities. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>, who was n't made available for an interview, did n't know her at all. `` His mother was wild,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. `` Neither one -LRB- mother or father -RRB- was going to take care of him.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> has lived in a nursing home since May, when she broke her leg in a fall. In an interview, a reporter's mention of <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> made her shiver. `` His legs are longer than mine and younger, too,'' she said. `` I could n't keep up with him. There are lots of things you ca n't do when you get up in age. I knowed he was going to get into trouble.'' The first hint came when he was 7. Ghetto gangs appeared outside his great-grandmother's rowhouse at night and whistled for him to come out and romp. `` He got with the bad crowd, started stealing bikes, stealing cars and driving cars,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. `` He was n't a bad little boy. He just got in with them older boys.'' She said she tried to keep <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> out of trouble and gave him love. `` He'd come and look at me with them pitiful eyes and ask for a dollar. I'd give that little boy my heart. He knowed I was soft-hearted.'' But there was no one else to head off trouble. `` This kid had a poor hand dealt to him. He was not given the tools to make it,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanshine </PERSON>, an attorney with the Defender Association. `` He's been on the streets more or less raising himself,'' added <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Crudup </PERSON>, executive director of a juvenile detention center. `` The reason it came to everybody's attention is that he killed two people. He probably could have gone on stealing cars for years.'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>'s first arrest was July 16, 1986, for stealing $ 327 from his great-grandmother. Mrs. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> turned him in but later dropped the charges. Before that month was out, he was arrested three times for robbery and once for arson. Last spring, he was arrested for theft and for unauthorized use of an auto. More charges of car theft and running away followed in June. On July 5, he was sentenced to a state lockup at <LOCATION> Loysville </LOCATION> and given a transfer date of Sept. 6 because no space was immediately available. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> was placed in a juvenile home that was no match for him. Three times, he fled and was re-arrested. Each time, he was charged with theft, receiving stolen property and unauthorized use of an auto. To hold him, authorities wanted to put him in the Youth Study Center, the city's only maximum-security lockup for juveniles. But the 105-bed facility was 57 kids over its limit. And under a 1987 court order, the city agreed not to take anyone younger than 13. The courts sent him back to a home that had locks on the doors and windows, but no bars. `` I could n't hold him because it's against the law,'' said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, the Family Court judge. `` It broke my heart.''

District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> derisively called the homes `` escape shelters'' because 40 to 50 juveniles run away from them each month. His office has asked the city for 100 additional maximum-security spaces for hard-core offenders. `` We just do n't have enough space. It's not easy to explain to the families of the victims. You have to defend a system you know stinks,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Toczydlowski </PERSON>, deputy district attorney in charge of the juvenile division. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> created his own diversion to slip out of the <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 8. While other boys staged a fight, he stole a set of keys from a guard. Two weeks later, he and two chums, aged 13 and 14, prowled a parking lot, looking for a car. They opted for a gray 1986 <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciera </PERSON>, smashing a back window to get in. Using a screw driver with expert precision, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> pried off the ignition lock on the steering column and hot-wired the starter. Police spotted the joy riders running a red light and gave chase in a cruiser equipped with flashing dome lights but no siren. With the cops on his tail, blowing their horn and flashing their high beams, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> ran four stop signs and another red light. It was 5:30 p.m. Rush hour. `` I did n't want to get caught,'' the boy told police. `` I just floored it and took off. I was doing about 60 miles an hour.'' The Oldsmobile rammed a 1986 Chrysler LeBaron driven by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, a 53-year-old real estate agent on his way home from work. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s first wife had died of cancer in 1976 and he later married her sister. Between them, they had nine children. The Chrysler careened into <PERSON> Tyesha </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, 11, a sixth-grader walking to the grocery store with her sister, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, 7. They were a block from home. <PERSON> Tyesha </PERSON>, who sang in the choir of the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicetown </ORGANIZATION>, died at a hospital. Her sister, who suffered critical head injuries, was released Dec. 5. `` The pursuit probably lasted 30 seconds,'' said Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, who chased <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> in the cruiser. `` I said to my partner, ` He's going to crash that car.' We were really upset when we found out other people had been hit.'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> suffered scratches on his arms and face. In handcuffs, he was shown the Tate girl's body. `` He was n't upset. He was n't anything. The only thing he said was, ` Oh, no,''' said <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> was charged with homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, auto theft, unlawful use of an auto and conspiracy. Because he is a juvenile, he was tried under the single charge of delinquency. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, no one under 14 can be tried as an adult unless the charge is murder. `` There's more than enough blame to spread around,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group. `` The solution is to build another major lockup for several million dollars we do n't have or plan for a program to deal with the problem up front when juveniles first get into trouble,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said. `` It makes more sense to spend money to build a barn that works rather than spend money on locks for a door that's already open. You ca n't do patchwork repairs on a juvenile justice system.''

 It was the year they held a presidential election and half the nation's voters decided to stay home. It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered, barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the world. It was the year an early decision to let <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> burn altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come. It was the year <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> decided to diet, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> decided to resign, evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> decided to confess his sins and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> decided to challenge world heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. Some decisions worked; others did n't. Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Dec. 7 and addressed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed forces. The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that tens of thousands had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities crumbled under the quake's force. The official death count had ranged as high as 55,000, but eventually the Soviets said just under 25,000 people were confirmed dead. Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had accepted disaster relief from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid his first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in June for a summit that failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered away on human rights issues, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later sent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> living proof of his commitment to change. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, father of the Soviet dissident movement, was allowed his first trip outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies. Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than 5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in July in 32 cities and continued through the year. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old, intact. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, confirmed as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice by a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but gave no hint of his views. Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the once-powerful. Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the king and queen of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate, pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges. Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> became the first governor in a half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to restore military aid to the Contras but decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce. In a decision that stunned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized talks with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the first time in at least 13 years. `` Our object is not a dialogue,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Our object is peace.'' Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the guerrilla war raged on.

Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and engineers at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which traces its roots to the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> formed in 1878 to support the experiments of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>. GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal organs without X-rays. Real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories, not pulled from the depths of the earth. In 1979, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was the first company to pass the 50,000 th patent mark But <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s _ and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s _ technological lead is being threatened by the Japanese who, up until now, have had a reputation as clever copycats. Since the end of World War II, the Japanese have borrowed American inventions, improved them and turned them into inexpensive household staples. Color television sets, transistor radios and videocassettee recorders were all original American ideas the Japanese have capitalized on. All that is changing. The Japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of American scientists and engineers for new technology, says <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Rensselaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> and former vice president of corporate research and development at GE. The Japanese are trying to be innovators, <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> says. Their aggressive patenting efforts prove that. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now acquires more patents worldwide than any other country. <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still leads the way in developing new technology. `` But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is now in a stage where they're starting to do this,'' he said. Japanese business executives say it's only natural for their companies to develop their own technology. `` Any company that hopes to continue making progress will require innovation, be it through its own or transferred technology,'' said <PERSON> Kazuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosaka </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s patent office in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Many in this country question whether the Japanese can be pioneering. The Japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year, they're quick at turning inventions into products and their students study science and technology in an education system considered superior in those areas. But they're strangled by a culture that frowns upon risk-taking and prizes collective action over individual effort. Their scientists and engineers are n't trained to be pioneering. Americans, meanwhile, are encouraged to be creative. `` We educate our scientists to be pioneers,'' <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said. A recent study for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> showed that in 1987, three Japanese companies garnered the most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patents: <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> with 873, <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> with 850 and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> with 830. GE, which until 1986 had held the No. 1 spot for 25 years, was fourth with 782 patents. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> executives at the company's <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; D center, located in a sprawling complex of buildings overlooking the <LOCATION> Mohawk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, dispute the results of the patent study done by <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizons </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting company. They argue GE would still rank as patent leader if the study had included patents granted to RCA, which GE acquired in 1986. `` Whoever did the study obviously did n't know RCA was a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, manager of patent and legal operations at GE. Top GE officials, though, see the study as a warning. `` It does n't mean we should n't be concerned,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, vice president of corporate research and development at GE. `` There are still three Japanese companies in the top four.'' Moreover, the Japanese are beating the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is their ability to rapidly commercialize inventions, such as the VCR. `` We get out of the starting block fast,'' <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said. `` But we lose it on the long stretch. We've lost the ability to do the long haul.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best hope in its competition with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may be its education system. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is far ahead of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in an area vital to technological and scientific development: the encouragement of creative thought. Yet serious problems exist in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s education system. `` We have fewer and fewer students with an interest in science and technology,'' said <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. He believes that for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remain No. 1 in science and technology it must, in some ways, imitate the Japanese. `` The Japanese understand that manufacturability and customer preferences are integral parts of the innovation process, not afterthoughts,'' <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said. `` I see no reason why we Americans ca n't renew our skills at the application of science and technology while maintaining our strength as pioneers.''

<HEAD>Little-Known Tax Change Could Cause Big Problems For Firms,
Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Picture this: You've just undergone extensive surgery for which the insurance company has picked up most of the tab. But by year's end you're suddenly forced to pay taxes on those benefits just as if they were part of your regular income. Then you're socked with taxes on other company-sponsored extras, like the group life insurance policy or the subsidized day-care program and night classes. Even those daily meals in the company cafeteria are n't safe. Welcome to Section 89, known to some tax experts and companies as the `` Twilight Zone'' of the 1986 tax reform law. While it's unlikely such a nightmarish scenario could occur, the potential is in place under the little-known provision that mandates changes in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s employee-benefit structure starting next year. The intention of the new rules had been to encourage employers to offer health insurance and other benefits to more of their workers _ and more democratically. But many tax experts say the opposite is likely to occur, and the harsh penalties for companies that break the law could create a slew of tax hardships for employees. Section 89 is divided into two parts. One requires businesses to communicate to their employees exactly what benefits are being offered and the qualifications for receiving them. Failure to spell these out means employees must include the entire value of the benefits in their gross income. `` If an employee's health insurance paid out $ 50,000 for surgery ... he could be taxed on that amount,'' explained <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zesk </PERSON>, a senior manager with <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells. And if companies fail to report that income on their employee's W-2 tax form, they can be fined, he said Most big companies already have written benefit plans in place, so their employees need not worry about paying taxes on important health benefits or on the savings derived from company-subsidized child-care programs or meals in the cafeteria, tax experts say. Those requirements of Section 89 will hit small businesses the hardest. Even if companies fail to comply, the penalties are `` so Draconian'' that they probably would n't be imposed, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Veal </PERSON>, a senior manager with the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. But the other portion of Section 89, which deals with `` discriminatory'' benefits plans, has many companies concerned, experts say. The new law says that if top-paid company executives _ those making around $ 52,230 a year or more _ are given more health or life insurance benefits than lesser-paid employees, the top brass must pay taxes on the `` excess.'' The idea was to encourage companies to distribute benefits equally, especially to the 37 million Americans who currently do n't have health insurance `` The intent was somewhat noble, but I think they went overboard. It's a prime example of overkill,'' <PERSON> Zesk </PERSON> said. In order to comply with this part of the new rules companies must submit to a lengthy testing procedure that determines whether benefits are available to at least 90 percent of the work force, including part-timers who work at least 17.5 hours a week. Tax experts say that many companies may just find it cheaper to pay their executives more money to make up for the taxes they'll pay on the cushier benefits, than to provide more benefits for the rank-and-file employees. Others may decide to cut back on the core benefits provided to everyone or else make do with fewer part-timers, they say. For now, companies across the country are working with accounting firms to prepare for Section 89. `` Some clients have gathered the data -LRB- for the testing procedure -RRB- and are going forward ... and some are still at the stumped and disbelief stage,'' said Veal.

<HEAD>Tulsa Company Seeing Success By Fiber-Optic Light</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIL BROYLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Barely more than three years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> and career pipeliner <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> decided to take a risk in the fledgling technology of fiber-optic communications. Overnight, <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> went from being president of a successful pipeline company to a dingy basement office surrounded by cardboard boxes, where he had only six employees. At first, he did n't even have a telephone. `` My God,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said he thought to himself. `` What have I got myself into?'' Although it did n't look that way at first, he and the company whose fortunes had been tied almost exclusively to the cyclical fates of the energy industry were about to leap to light speed. The new technology allows strands of optical glass as thin as hairs, encased in underground cables, to carry huge volumes of information via bursts of laser light. Comparing the quality of fiber-optic transmissions to regular telephone lines, <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said, is like comparing a compact disk to a 78-rpm record. The absence of noise from radio frequency and electromagnetic interference means both voice and computer data can be digitalized and sent long distances in less time for less money. <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON>, 45, was president of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, when the company first began exploring new uses for its out-of-service petroleum pipelines in 1985. At the same time, regional telecommunications companies were tapping <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' pipeline-building expertise for fiber-optic cable. Someone suggested <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> could run fiber-optic cables through its old pipelines. `` That's how we really stumbled into the business,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said. `` We decided to go ahead and make that move and not look back. ... We moved into it very quickly and we were extremely successful.'' The parent company quickly invested $ 200 million in the fiber-optic system. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> selected the company's 3,800-mile network as one of the outstanding engineering achievements of 1986. By the end of 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION> LDX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Net </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to become <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, it had more than 5,000 miles of fiber-optic line. At the end of 1987, the telecommunications company's annualized revenues had reached $ 109 million from an annual rate of $ 8 million at the beginning of that year. WTG surged into profitability this year well ahead of expectations, with a third-quarter operating profit of $ 5.3 million compared with an operating loss of $ 7.8 million in the third quarter of 1987. WTG will complete construction of its own fiber optic cable to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next month to replace a line it had been leasing. The company is expanding from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by purchasing a 400-mile fiber-optic line and constructing a 500-mile segment, pushing its total to more than 6,000 miles. `` We found some difficulty in selling to major corporations when you really do n't own and control your own network,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said. `` It's a very real advantage. A lot of people say 40 percent of all communications traffic comes into and goes out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' WTG boasts it is the first network to offer highly reliable fiber-optic communications capability from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said it means his company has joined the big leagues with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We, all of a sudden within 36 to 40 months, have gone from the point of ` Let's see if we can get into this business' to being the fourth network,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said from the company's new high-tech, high-style corporate headquarters overlooking downtown <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. WTG sells capacity both to other communications companies and to private businesses, but plans to expand its commercial sales efforts. `` Of the Fortune 2,000 companies, we're into half of them. Of the Fortune 100 companies, we're into half of them,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said. `` For a little <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> company to go into those major corporations and to sell them services is not an easy task. `` Almost every single major carrier in the country uses us, with the exception of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said. `` And if you look at most of their network maps and the marketing literature that they put out, they show their fiber-optic network, which is our fiber-optic network.'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said his company had a leg up on the industry because it knew how to build underground pipelines across country. It was familiar with the environmental restrictions, the negotiations for right-of-way, and the need to avoid areas where construction activity could cause line breaks. Earlier this year, WTG opened a futuristic $ 2.4 million control center in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> that monitors 11,000 miles of fiber lines for a five-member consortium called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The customized system provides constant information about the performance of the network and its dozens of repeater stations. The center keeps in constant contact with a force of 200 technicians who patrol the lines. <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said the company is proud of its reliability, which approaches 99.999 percent. `` That's one way we're trying to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said. Reliability is crucial for customers who count on digital telecommunications to do banking, schedule airline flights, operate car telephones, order catalog merchandise and dispatch truckers cross-country. <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said competition following the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has made it all possible. `` I think if the industry stayed regulated the way it was, there was no big need to try to develop technologically the revolution that we're seeing, the information society, the information age,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell in narrow, quiet European trading Thursday as markets wound down for the year. Gold prices were lower. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar remained stable, with firm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates continuing to hold the currency at relatively high levels. They said trading was extremely quiet, even stagnant, as many market players and dealers remained on vacation between Christmas and New Year's holidays. A dealer said a steep decline in the dollar at the beginning of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> session was more a reflection of thin seasonal trading than any market bearishness. Little dollar movement was also expected on Friday, the last trading day of the year. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.76 yen to a closing 126.03. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.80 yen. The British pound was quoted at $ 1.7900, unchanged from Wednesday. Other late dollar rates, compared with late Wednesday's prices, 1.7875 West German marks, down from 1.7960; 1.5125 Swiss francs, down from 1.5177; 6.0975 French francs, down from 6.1225; 2.0190 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0255; 1,314.50 Italian lire, down from 1,320.90; and 1.19225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1963.

<HEAD>November Construction Contracts Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release after 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of new construction contracts rose in November, with the bulk of the increase from non-residential building projects, a business-research company reported Thursday. The F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said that new construction projects were up 3 percent last month over October to an annualized value of $ 246.7 billion. Construction contracts rose 1 percent in October following three straight monthly declines. Setting the pace for the November increase was the non-residential building sector, which rose a seasonally adjusted 7 percent to an annualized value of $ 80.9 billion, the report said. Newly started housing was up 4 percent to an annualized value of $ 126.0 billion, with continued strength in one-family houses, it said. Non-building construction, which includes public works and utility projects, declined 9 percent to an annualized value of $ 39.8 billion, the report said. `` Although November's contracting was helped by a rare spurt of office building, it has been the consistency of demand for single family homes that has been the main support of the construction sector throughout 1988,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> economist. `` Until the expected rise of mortgage rates materializes, homebuilding is making the difference between a sharp decline and a gentle letdown from last year's peak of total construction activity.'' For the first 11 months, new construction starts on an unadjusted basis totaled $ 233.4 billion, down 2 percent from the same period in 1987, the report said. The West, with a 2 percent rise over last year, was the only major region to show a gain in 1988. The South and the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> had 11 month declines of 5 percent and 4 percent respectively, according to the report.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge presiding over a rate-hike suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> issued an order Thursday temporarily barring the financially shaky utility from paying dividends to shareholders. Company spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON> sought to minimize the impact of the order, saying the company had not paid dividends since 1984. He said <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate plans to resume payments. The temporary restraining order issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> is in effect until next Wednesday when <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> has scheduled a hearing for <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> to argue why it should be lifted. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> is seeking a settlement of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s successful civil racketeering suit against <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION>, an accord that could possibly include closing the controversial <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> county. Closed negotiations have been held for about two weeks. A jury earlier this month found that the utility had lied to state officials about the progress of the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant to obtain rate increases in 1978 and 1984. The jury awarded $ 22.8 million in damages to <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>. `` I think this is really the judge trying to assert his authority and to show everybody how tough he's going to be and to force the parties to negotiate a settlement to this whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, a senior utilities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> downplayed the effect the order may have on Wall Street. `` The actual order is not significant in my opinion because <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> could n't pay the dividends anyway,'' he said. `` I think that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has no ability and no desire to pay any dividends in the short run.'' The restraining order was issued in response to a request by <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, an attorney representing ratepayers. In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> denied <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an immediate 5.4 percent rate increase and said it would reconsider the utility's request again on Jan. 25.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans for price increases for nearly all consumer and professional films, as well as photographic papers and chemicals. The increases, announced Thursday, will be effective with orders beginning January 26, 1989 and are publicized in catalog inserts now in the mail to dealers. `` It's a fairly modest increase,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` The increase reflects the general cost of doing business. It's reasonably normal and not unexpected for January.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said amateur films will increase 3.5 percent, with the exception of <ORGANIZATION> Kodachrome </ORGANIZATION> 25 film and Kodachrome 64 film, which will increase 7 percent. The price increases will also affect two camera models: the K40 will increase $ 3 and the Mickey-Matic will go up $ 1. Prices on all Carousel slide projectors are being increased by 4 percent. Price increases for professional film will range from 2 to 6 percent. Color papers for photofinishers will rise 3 percent, while chemical prices will see an average upswing of 3.5 percent, according to <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>.

 The stock market advanced broadly today, sending its best-known index above its highest closing level of the year in a rally that analysts attributed to year-end bargain hunting. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 3.75 points on Wednesday, was up 17.50 at 2,183.93 with two hours left in the session. The Dow Jones industrial average's highest close this year was 2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21. Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 2 to 1 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 949 up, 482 down and 513 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 93.92 million shares at 2 p.m. on Wall Street compared with 79.38 million shares at the same point Wednesday. Analysts said year-end bargain hunting was putting some upward pressure on prices. They said the gains reflects efforts by some institutional investors to spruce up their end-of-year portfolios by adding some top-quality issues. `` With the market near its highs for the year, the large cash position that some money managers find themselves with is embarrassing,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the gains today also reflected some confidence in the stock market to hold its ground despite rising interest rates earlier in the week. Yields on some short-term Treasury issues, for instance, have risen above 9 percent and pose competition for the uncertain returns on stocks.

 Americans should expect to pay more to dress up, gas up, light up and eat out in 1989, but staying in will probably cost less, according to a report released Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In its annual forecast, the business-information concern predicted moderate inflation for next year, with consumer prices rising between 4.5 percent and 5 percent. That compares with an increase of around 4.25 percent this year. The survey said that prices on new clothing are expected to be between 5 percent and 10 percent higher in 1989, while the cost of cigarettes should jump around 10 percent. Among its other findings: _ Eating or and going to the movies should cost 3 percent to 5 percent more _ Insurance premiums for homeowners should rise 7 percent to 10 percent _ Gasoline should cost about 5 cents more a gallon _ Food, in general, should rise about 4 percent _ Prices for videocassettes and compact discs should decline _ Electricity and home furnishings should hold steady `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s renewed efforts to contain price increases by boosting interest rates will help keep a lid on inflation for the time being,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON>, S & amp; P's chief economist. `` However, while the current inflation rate is moderate and certainly tolerable, it is creeping upward.'' <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON> noted that unemployment remains at a 14-year low and business capacity utilization is on the rise, two factors that could rekindle higher inflation unless economic policy changes are made.

<HEAD>US Probes Complaint of Unfair Practice by EEC In Copper Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has started an investigation into complaints that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other European countries unfairly restrict imports of American copper scrap, the government announced Wednesday. If the investigation and proposed mediation efforts fail to resolve the dispute within 18 months, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can then retaliate against the Europeans. In accordance with procedures for investigating such complaints, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative has asked <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to agree to consultations. If consultations with the Europeans fail to yield satisfactory results, said <ORGANIZATION> USTR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will take its case to international arbitration. The investigation comes at a time of strained relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> over a ban which the Europeans plan to implement Jan. 1 on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat treated with hormones. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to retaliate against the Europeans with 100 percent duties on a variety of imported foods and beverages. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the copper scrap investigation is not related in any way to the hormone dispute. The petition was filed on Nov. 14, and by law the <ORGANIZATION> USTR </ORGANIZATION> had to respond within 45 days, he said. The Copper and <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fabricators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents American manufacturers, contends its members lose $ 180 million annually in revenues because of quotas set by the Europeans. Copper scrap is used to make such products as door knobs, brass lamps and guard rails. Since September 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accepted 65 to 70 petitions of complaint from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers against foreign competitors, and acted on 27 either through international mediation or retaliation.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell in the week ended Dec. 19, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,065.8 billion from $ 3.066.7 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, decreased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,902.8 billion from $ 3,905.3 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 785.5 billion from a revised $ 787.2 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 720 million, compared with a decline of $ 445 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 285.3 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from $ 284.9 billion two weeks earlier

 <PERSON> Palais </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bealls </ORGANIZATION>, two fashion retail outlets in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, were acquired Thursday by an investment group formed by <ORGANIZATION> Bain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> investment firm. During the the past several years, <ORGANIZATION> Bain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> has obtained 15 companies that operate in a variety of retail and manufacturing businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Palais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bealls </ORGANIZATION> will operate under a newly formed holding company, <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Palais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> will serve as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the holding company The Palais Royal transaction will provide about $ 90 million to the shareholders plus other considerations, said <PERSON> Moselle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Palais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>. `` The purpose of this sale is to ensure the continuation of those successful methods that have been utilized in the past, and to foster the growth of our fine retail establishment in the future,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Bealls </ORGANIZATION> was founded as a partnership in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in 1923 by brothers <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beall </PERSON>. Three months later, their brother W.F. `` Willie'' <PERSON> Beall </PERSON> joined the family partnership, and served as the company's president until his death in 1953. Terms of the Bealls transaction were n't disclosed. <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bekenstein </PERSON>, a partner of <ORGANIZATION> Bain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION>, said the combination of Palais Royal with <ORGANIZATION> Bealls </ORGANIZATION> creates a quality fashion retailer of significant magnitude for the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. The Palais Royal acquisition received heavy publicity because <PERSON> Moselle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> is the wife of a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who has been presiding over a civil fraud case by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which helped finance the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had argued that its indirect financial relationship with the judge should have compelled him to quit the case, which remains stalled over the issue of his impartiality. The outcome of the civil case has been clouded further by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement last week to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution to settle a criminal securities fraud probe. That agreement with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office is contingent on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s settlement of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> civil charges.

<HEAD>Heated Demand Pushes Coffee Futures To 25-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices surged to their highest levels in more than two years Thursday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid strong demand for tight supplies of green, unroasted coffee beans. On other markets, in uniformly light, pre-holiday trading, gold, silver and energy futures retreated; grains and soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Thursday marked the last full day of trading this year on most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures markets. Most markets will close at noon local time Friday and reopen on Tuesday. Coffee settled 3.80 cents to 6.94 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.5898 a pound. During the session, the March contract traded as high as $ 1.596 a pound, the highest coffee futures price since Nov. 14, 1986. Poor growing and harvesting conditions in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have cut deeply into the availability of green coffee, forcing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roasters to pay higher prices to obtain supplies for the winter months, when coffee consumption reaches its annual peak. The recent, rapid rise in prices _ a gain of more than 30 cents a pound since Dec. 1 _ has also prompted roasters to buy March coffee futures as a hedge against futher price increases on the cash market, analysts said. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a coffee broker with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the widening price gap between the March and May coffee contracts indicated that demand for near-term supplies was continuing to grow. The March contract's price rose by nearly 7 cents a pound Wednesday while May deliveries advanced by just over 4.8 cents. `` This is a demand-driven market,'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said. `` Roasters are flocking to March and selling May because they believe there's going to be an acute tightness of quality beans in March, whereby by May it should be relieved.'' The tight-supply situation should ease during the second quarter of 1989 as more newly harvested beans reach the market and consumption begins a seasonal decline, he said. Platinum futures prices rebounded after hitting resistance near $ 500 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but gold and silver futures posted significant losses on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>., Rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would sell physical gold to pay for new grain purchases kept the gold and silver markets under pressure although trading volume was extremely thin, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, manager of futures research for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Platinum settled $ 1.30 to $ 4.30 higher with January at $ 514.30 a troy ounce; gold was $ 6.10 to $ 8 lower with February at $ 415.60 a troy ounce; silver was 9.1 cents to 10 cents lower with March at $ 609.3 cents a troy ounce. Energy futures prices fell moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid profit-taking and book-squaring ahead of the New Year's weekend, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 23 cents lower with February at $ 16.77 a barrel; heating oil was .69 cent to .83 cent lower with January at 52.77 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .03 cent to .60 cent lower with January at 47.01 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures were little changed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> despite a surge in sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, corn and soybean meal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The corn and wheat business had been expected and a 600,000-metric ton meal sale was offset by losses in the soybean oil pit, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an assistant vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Wheat settled 1 \ cents lower to 1 \ cent higher with March at $ 4.36 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.82 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.39 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -RCB- cent to 5 \ cents lower with January at $ 7.88 -RCB- Livestock and meat futures ended narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on position-evening ahead of the long weekend, analysts said. Live cattle settled .07 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with January at 84.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .32 cent lower with February at 46.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at 43.12 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Stocks Rally, Dow Jones Industrials Finish Just Shy of Year's High</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with closing prices throughout.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 A year-end search for bargains among blue-chip issues propelled stock prices to a broad rally on Thursday that left the market's best-known gauge only a shade below its highest closing level this year. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which gained 3.75 points on Wednesday, climbed another 16.25 to close at 2,182.68. That was less than a point below its 1988 closing high of 2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21, which also was the highest close since the October 1987 crash. At mid-afternoon, the blue-chip index was slightly above the year's high closing mark but it lost some ground by the end of the session. As the market heads into its final trading session of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average is about 12.6 percent above its 1987 close of 1,938.83. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 987 up, 477 down and 524 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 131.29 million shares, up from 110.63 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 160.14 million shares. Analysts said year-end bargain hunting was mainly responsible for boosting prices. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said most of the institutional investors who wanted to sell have already done so `` So when you get some nibbling by bargain-hunters, it is easy to lift -LRB- the Dow Jones industrial average -RRB- with no supply around,'' he said. The analysts said the gains also reflected efforts by some institutional investors to spruce up their end-of-year portfolios or put some excess cash to work by adding some top-quality issues. `` With the market near its highs for the year, the large cash position that some money managers find themselves with is embarrassing,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the gains also demonstrated relief that the stock market held its ground earlier this week despite rising interest rates. Yields on some short-term Treasury issues, for instance, have risen above 9 percent and pose increasing competition for the uncertain returns on stocks. In the credit markets Thursday, prices and yields were fairly stable. `` The view is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will not raise the discount rate right away,'' said <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>. The discount rate is the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s interest charge on loans to financial institutions. Among the active issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SCECorp </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 32 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 5 \ and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 39 Quantum Chemical, which rose 18 | on Wednesday after announcing a restructuring plan, rose -LRB- to 107 <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said Quantum's plan appeared to draw attention to the values in several basic industrial groups, such as steel, forest prodcucts and chemicals, and contributed to rises in those areas on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Fluor </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 23 |, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LCB- to 88, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 83, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 to 46 -LRB-, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> added \ to 28 |, <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 23 ~ and <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> gained -LCB- International Business Machines rose -RCB- to 123 \ Also in the technolgy group, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 | to 98 -RCB-, Data General added | to 18 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 60 In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 | to 8 -RRB- on speculation that someone may be interested in acquiring a stake in the business, sports and shopping service As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 18.29 billion, or 0.67 percent, in value.

 A federal judge lifted a restraining order preventing the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from paying stock dividends after the financially shaky utility agreed Thursday to notify the court 10 days before issuing any dividends. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, who is presiding over the rate-hike suit against <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, issued the restraining order in the morning, but lifted it seven hours later. Shortly after the order was signed, a company spokesman minimized its impact, saying the company had not paid dividends since 1984 and had no immediate plans to resume payments. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> scheduled a hearing on the issue for next Wednesday. The judge is seeking a settlement of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s successful civil racketeering suit against <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, an accord that could possibly include closing the controversial <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. Closed negotiations have been ongoing for about two weeks. A jury earlier this month found that the utility had lied to state officials about the progress of the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant to obtain rate increases in 1978 and 1984. The jury awarded $ 22.8 million in damages to <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> must now decide whether to certify a class of ratepayers in the suit, making <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> liable for at least $ 4 billion. `` I think this is really the judge trying to assert his authority and to show everybody how tough he's going to be and to force the parties to negotiate a settlement to this whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, a senior utilities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> downplayed the effect the temporary order would have on Wall Street. `` The actual order is not significant in my opinion because <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> could n't pay the dividends anyway,'' he said. `` I think that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has no ability and no desire to pay any dividends in the short run.'' On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 13 per share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up 25 cents. The restraining order was issued in response to a request by <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, the attorney representing the proposed class of ratepayers. said these payments would total about $ 1 billion. `` In view of <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s limited net worth, payment of such dividends ... would severely reduce <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to pay a judgement awarded to the proposed plaintiff class,'' she wrote in an affidavit. `` It would further severely impair the likelihood of achieving a fair and reasonable settlement on behalf of the plaintiff class.'' In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> denied <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an immediate 5.4 percent rate increase and said it would reconsider the utility's request again on Jan. 25.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it has completed the sale of two television stations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in a deal the TV production company says removes a major obstacle to its $ 1.2 billion merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, producer of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' `` Alf'' and other TV series, said Thursday it sold WLII-TV in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and WSUR-TV in <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> investment group headed by <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumlik </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> Terms of the deal were not disclosed. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s ownership of the Puerto Rican stations and of WPGH-TV in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> had stymied New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to buy <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> for approximately $ 1.2 billion in stock. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, got a court order in August blocking the deal on grounds it violated a 1984 agreement signed when <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> bought shares in each other. The agreement, which gave <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> 42.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> television subsidiary, barred <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> from owning other television stations. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> owned six stations when it agreed to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.

 Federal regulators, working against a year-end tax deadline, announced the sale of 13 more insolvent savings and loan institutions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Thursday. The latest deals brought to 197 the number of insolvent S & amp; Ls which have been dealt with by federal officials this year, a post-Depression record, far surpassing the 48 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls closed in 1987. Officials predicted that they are sure to top the target of dealing with 200 failed S & amp; Ls this year before a midnight deadline Saturday, when tax breaks for the buyers of ailing <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will be cut in half. The latest takeovers included the first purchase of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions by foreigners. A group of investors from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> agreed to buy eight insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions. The latest deals followed two of the largest bailouts of S & amp; Ls. The government announced Wednesday it was pledging assistance totaling $ 6.8 billion to the purchasers of a huge <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> institution and five of the most financially troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> S & amp; Ls. The agreements Thursday were announced after the three-member <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spent the day huddled behind closed doors reviewing offers. In one of the deals, eight insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls were sold to <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> subsidiary of a Taiwanese company, which agreed to invest $ 37.5 million to purchase the S & amp; Ls. The branches will be operated under the name <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F.S.B. </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. The bank board agreed to provide $ 566.2 million in government assistance to the purchasers. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> hailed the sale to the Taiwanese investors, saying, `` We welcome our first non-U.S. owned investor to the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the program for dealing with sick S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB-. Their interest in investing in the future of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is a further indication of the attractiveness of the state's thrift industry as well as it's business climate, which is what we've been saying all along.'' The S & amp; Ls being purchased were Charter Savings and Loan of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Lampasas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bayview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Luling </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Gonzales </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Yoakum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yoakum </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Sequin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sequin </ORGANIZATION>. A second sale involved four insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts, which were purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Centex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> home builder, who will operate the former branches as <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> F.S.B. In that transaction, the bank board will provide $ 429 million in government assistance and <ORGANIZATION> Centex </ORGANIZATION> will invest $ 26.5 million. The insolvent S & amp; Ls purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Centex </ORGANIZATION> were <ORGANIZATION> Burnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnet </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giddings </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Ranchers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>; and Peoples Savings and Loan of <LOCATION> Llano </LOCATION>. The third deal involved the sale of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, at a cost to the government of $ 187.9 million. The insolvent S & amp; L was being taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, which will operate <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s 23 offices as branches of Citizens Federal. Citizens Federal is investing no money in the deal. Federal regulators faced new criticism on Thursday about their year-end rush to close insolvent S & amp; Ls, but they continued to insist that the cost to the government of simply closing the institutions and paying off depositors would far exceed the sales being arranged which use tax breaks and direct federal assistance as a lure for private investors. The tax benefits will be effectively cut in half after midnight Saturday. The provisions that will expire allow firms who purchased failed S & amp; Ls to deduct the previous losses of those associations from profits the firms earned on other operations. In virtually all of transactions completed in 1988, the firms taking over the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will qualify for tax breaks that will far exceed what they are paying for the institutions. Congressional critics have questioned these tax benefits, contending that the bank board is rushing the sales through without a proper analysis of the revenue loss to the federal government. In a letter to Wall, Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>. and the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said `` I have serious questions about the impact your plans will have on the federal budget, the competitive balance of the remaining thrift industry and the concentration of power without our financial systems. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> and the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to hold a series of hearings, looking especially at the two largest bailouts announced this week involving $ 6.8 billion in government assistance in the sale of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and the purchase of five deeply troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> S & amp; Ls by a group headed by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> cosmetics chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>. `` All of the bank board's eleventh-hour deals will be reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in a statement. `` We will be looking at whether the bank board has been getting the best deals possible.'' Wall called the Bass purchase `` a major achievement of an extremely eventful 1988'' because it took off the government's hands American Savings of <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the country's largest insolvent S & amp; <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be looking for ways to finance the remaining 400 insolvent S & amp; Ls. Estimates of the total cost to the government of resolving the S & amp; L mess range from $ 50 billion to $ 112 billion with even the low figure certain to swell the federal budget deficit. Industry losses from the insolvent institutions are mounting by $ 1 billion a month. For this reason, analysts said, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not afford to delay dealing with the problem. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who is remaining in his job in the new administration, has already launched a study to find ways to finance the rescue effort. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be committing political suicide if it does n't candidly address this problem immediately after taking office,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial consultant based in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. All of the S & amp; Ls being taken over this week have been insolvent for several years but have been kept open because the government's insurance fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, did not have enough cash to pay off depositors and shut the institutions

<HEAD>Pennwalt Files Suit Against Centaur Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> escalated efforts Thursday to prevent a hostile takeover by filing a federal lawsuit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> of violating securities laws in a recent tender offer. The suit seeks an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 765 million offer, which was filed Dec. 13 with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A news statement released Thursday night named <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> as an undisclosed joint partner with Centaur. The statement said the lawsuit `` demands among other things that Centaur and its affiliates correct the false and misleading statements in the tender offer materials.'' The statement did not include details of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations. A <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinard </PERSON>, said Thursday night that she had not read the suit and could not comment. She referred all questions to <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, of the Philadelphia-based law firm, Dechart, Price and <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> did not return a telephone call from The Associated Press Thursday night. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Tuesday called <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 100-per-share offer `` completely unacceptable. Officials of Centaur, an investment partnership, have said they will continue to press ahead with the takeover bid and want to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> executives to discuss a friendly merger. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> has said no meeting will occur. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, Chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> called Centaur's offer `` illusory'' and said it was not intended to succeed. Centaur, whose principals are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financiers <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, owns 12.7 percent of the chemical maker's outstanding shares <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> closed Thursday at 103 -RRB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, down |.

 A group of <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> employees filed suit Thursday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district court against the newspaper's former owner, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for failing to comply with terms of the company pension plan and refusing to terminate the plan and distribute its assets. The suit says <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> media group that owned the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> from 1969 to 1986, signed an agreement not to terminate or amend the pension plan at the time of its sale in 1986 to a media company led by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. The suit asks the court to stop a proposed merger of the plan and to distribute its assets to participants. About 800 current and former <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> employees are covered in the plan. The plaintiffs _ current and former <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> employees <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dameron </PERSON>, C.D. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> _ represent those covered in the plan. The suit says <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> wants to take $ 15 million of the $ 27 million in the pension plan for its own use, despite the fact that it has contributed less than $ 1 million to it for 19 years. Times Mirror kept control of the plan after selling the paper to <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. It attempted to terminate the plan for the first time in July 1986, then again last April. In August, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> filed formal notice to terminate the plan and take excess funds of about $ 15 million but withdrew the notice after being notified that the plan participants claimed all excess assets. In November, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> filed notice to merge the plan with another employee benefits plan it controls. It withdrew that notice Dec. 23 after receiving numerous complaints from participants. Times Mirror referred all comment to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>, who could not be contacted late Thursday.

<HEAD>Pepperidge Farm To Remove Tropical Oils From Crackers, Cookies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, prompted by what it called `` strong consumer concern,'' has announced plans to remove a coconut oil from its crackers and cookies by next summer. Officials of the Norwalk-based company said the oil will be removed from such products as the popular `` Original Goldfish.'' Coconut oil is a saturated fat that raises the cholesterol level. People who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher risk of a clogging of the arteries that can lead to heart attacks. `` We must find oils that will proximate tropical oils in terms of performance in the baking process, flavor, texture, mouth-feel and shelf-life stability,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, said in a prepared statement issued Wednesday. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> organization that has campaigned against products which use tropical oils, such as palm and coconut, said he was pleased by <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' decision to remove coconut oil from more than 50 brands of cookies and crackers. `` Ultimately Pepperidge Farms will have saved thousands of lives,'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said. `` They've got a tough job of reformulating their cookies and crackers.'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat than lard. Coconut and palm oil are popular because they help extend the shelf life of food products, <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said. Many products advertised as being free of cholesterol contain tropical oils that can help cholesterol form after consumption, he said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wainright </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, has said her company recently began using 100 percent soybean oil in all its breads. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, announced Dec. 12 that it had stopped using tropical oils in its Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal. <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> announced Nov. 16 that it would remove palm oil and palm kernal from its cookie and cracker products. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, 65, placed advertisments in newspapers in October depicting nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods, but are `` poisoning'' Americans with saturated fats. A multimillionaire who nearly died from a heart attack in 1966, <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> has spent $ 2 million on a crusade to pressure food industry giants into making healthier products. His father and a brother-in-law died of heart attacks.
