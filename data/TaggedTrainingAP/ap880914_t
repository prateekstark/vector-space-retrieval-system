 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted a temporary stay of execution Wednesday night for a 28-year-old murderer who was scheduled to die by injection for a fatal convenience story holdup that netted $ 24. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON>'s execution, scheduled for after 1 a.m. EDT Thursday, was stayed by the full court, spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said. The court granted the temporary stay pending a timely filing of a request for a full review of the case by the court, she said. A federal district judge in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> had refused to stay Bridge's execution for for the 1980 shooting of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 62, in a convenience store robbery. Bridge's lawyer then took his case to the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Bridge would have been the 102nd inmate executed nationally, and the 28th in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in 1976 allowing states to resume the use of the death penalty. <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> contended in his appeal that during the punishment phase of Bridge's murder trial, jurors were not allowed to consider mitigating circumstances, or facts that might have led them to settle on a lesser punishment. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> cited arguments used in an appeal filed on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row inmate <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>, whose case the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to hear. After his arrest for the shooting, Bridge escaped briefly from the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail by knocking out a hole in the jail wall. He was captured 19 hours later hitchhiking along a freeway. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was shot four times with a .38 - caliber pistol as Bridge and his co-defendant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, robbed the convenience store of $ 24 on Feb. 10, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> died of his wounds on Feb. 24, 1980, four days after Bridge and Costa were arrested. Costa was convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was released under mandatory supervision in October 1986 after serving five years and eight months in prison. Bridge, a native of <LOCATION> Fauquier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he was in trouble since he was 8. He grew up in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and before moving to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he served 13 months of a 15-year prison term for burglary in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Bridge said in a recent interview that he was sorry <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> died, but complained his life on death row was worse than the shooting victim's fate. `` I sit here on death row for 7 -LCB- years and think about dying, and I believe Mr. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> got a better deal,'' he said. `` I keep wishing they would hurry up and do something. I tell you, this place will drive you crazy.'' During his time on death row, Bridge was implicated in the bombing of another inmate's cell and the non-fatal stabbing of a second inmate in incidents blamed on prison gang warfare. Bridge also was linked to membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION>, a white supremacist prison gang. `` I'm not affiliated,'' he said in the interview. `` I'm friends with everybody. And now I've got a black attorney. It's a touchy subject.''

 Solidarity's <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared to stand firm Wednesday on the issue of legalizing his federation, on the eve of a second preparatory meeting with authorities before talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. `` There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' he told reporters upon arriving in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused to confirm he will be meeting with communist authorities on Thursday. When pressed for comment on the talks, the leader of the outlawed free trade union movement replied, `` We will know more tomorrow.'' Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said a meeting of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and two or three other people would take place at noon Thursday to resolve obstacles to convening the talks. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he planned to remain in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> through Friday before departing for the southern city of <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> to attend a workers' pilgrimage over the weekend at the <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> monastery Elsewhere, members of the official union for transport workers in <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION> idled bus and streetcar service in that <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city of 250,000 for about six hours Wednesday to protest their pay, a union spokesman said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> earlier this month ended a series of Solidarity-led strikes in exchange for the promise of talks on the federation's future But the brief <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION> stoppage was mounted by an official trade union created after Solidarity was outlawed in 1982. Regional official union spokesman <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Koscielak </PERSON> said the transport workers want a pay increase of $ 6 a month which they were promised last year but never received. Average pay nationwide is about $ 100 monthly. <PERSON> Koscielak </PERSON> claimed the strike was legal under a 1982 law that allows strikes after a period of negotiation and arbitration. A spokesman at the main depot, who refused to give his name, said drivers began striking at 5 a.m. but went back to work at 11 a.m. The official trade union alliance, known by its Polish initials OPZZ, has been pressing the government to liberalize the laws on the right to strike. It has complained that denying official unions the strike weapon undermines their credibility with workers. The government acknowledges widespread worker unhappiness. This year's inflation rate has climbed to 60 percent, with supplies of consumer goods to stores even more erratic than usual because of increased exports to offset <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 39 billion foreign debt.

 <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, an `` extremely dangerous hurricane'' and one of the strongest storms in history, roared toward <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the tiny <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, civil defense officials said. Six people died and 60,000 were left homeless in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Monday, officials there said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said the hurricane swept the full length of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, `` leaving a trail of wreckage behind it.'' `` It will take us some time before we can assess the full damage without any doubt,'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said in a statement. `` But I have no doubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we have experienced in our modern history.'' Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and the death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and casualty reports. The hurricane, traveling westward across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, was upgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, described <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> as `` a great hurricane ... in the top 10 percent -LRB- historically -RRB- as far as intensity, size and destructive potential.'' Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ a 1935 storm that killed 408 people in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> coast in 1969 and killed 256 people. `` The people who need to be concerned now are those people over on the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, that whole area,'' Sheets said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated in the Yucatan resorts of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said people in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center, about 6 miles away. <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> is south of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and the reports said hotel guests also were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline. Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morning hours Wednesday. At midnight EDT the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, or about 150 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>. It said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph. The center said tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center. `` People in the warned areas should have completed all possible preparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane,'' it said. The center said Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure. It said by 8 p.m. EDT it was measured at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. `` That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>. `` There is very serious flooding'' in the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Erina </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a tourism official in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said Tuesday after speaking with residents of the islands. `` The Run Point -LRB- community -RRB- is taking a real beating.'' The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting 12-foot tides. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, an amateur radio operator in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboard missing near the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, according to reports from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, marketing director for <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, said his company's 18 helipads were working at full capacity to evacuate about 10,000 oil rigs in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said 40,000 people, many of them foreign vacationers and students, were evacuated Tuesday from the Isle of Youth off the southwestern coast as the hurricane passed 200 miles to the south. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a ham radio operator who was monitoring amateur radio communications in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> said Tuesday, `` <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> is devastated, <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is hit hard and <PERSON> Ocho </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> is flooded. The operator, <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Chwat </PERSON>, an officer with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said therth coast had been wrecked by the hurricane. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenbaum </PERSON>, a radio ham operator in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, said he spoke Tuesday with <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, an American staying in the <ORGANIZATION> Wyndham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> reported that the hotel ` peeled apart like a banana' when the force of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> hit last night,'' <PERSON> Schoenbaum </PERSON> said. `` This morning he says there is just nothing left. Boats that were on the beach, the little rental Sailfishes or Sunfishes, were driven into cars like spears _ power lines down, almost every tree in the area is on the ground.'' <PERSON> Schoenbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> told him people who were trying to enter the hotel on their hands and knees at the height of the storm were swept into the ocean. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, Me., said he spoke with a ham operator in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> who told him the roof of a hospital in <LOCATION> Mandeville </LOCATION> ripped off `` and the hospital has caved in And that is the worst horror show that I've heard about because that would imply that a lot of people could have been hurt.''

<HEAD>Report Says Covert Operatives Boosted Reagan's Central American
Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A House staff report says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts in covert intelligence and psychological operations exceeded their authority in helping rally public support for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Central America policies The House Foreign Affairs Committee staff said Tuesday these operatives `` conspired, through the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, to use the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a cover for a domestic operation which went far beyond the legal and ethical scope of their authority.'' Individuals and organizations working in the 1983-86 operation raised and spent money to influence congressional votes and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news media, the report said. The `` domestic political and propaganda operation'' was run through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomacy </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, known as `` S @ <ORGANIZATION> LPD </ORGANIZATION>,'' according to the committee's chief counsel, <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, and staff consultant <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>. The office reported directly to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> rather than through the normal <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> channels, a system established over the objections of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The staff report said many of the activities on behalf of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Central American policies were carried out by recipients of no-bid contracts `` hidden from public view.'' Some of the organizations with no-bid contracts also were part of former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret program to raise money for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. North used these fund-raising efforts along with funds diverted from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an elaborate scheme to aid the Contras at time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned such aid. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, when asked about the report by reporters Tuesday, held his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart to show how much attention he thought the study deserved. `` One day, I promise you, in a paragraph only about that long, I'm going to tell you the truth about Iran-Contra, as I did when it first came to light and which no one is reporting today,'' he said. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may write more than a paragraph. Calling the allegations `` old hat,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president plans to tell his side of the Iran-Contra affair in a book that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will author after leaving office. `` He feels it has been told, but that it just keeps coming up over and over again and people forget the original answers and the original investigations,'' the spokesman said. The report did not cite any laws or presidential directives that were violated, and it was not endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members. It was sent to the panel's chairman, <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said the committee staff has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether the operation violated laws restricting <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> domestic activities; government lobbying; and use of appropriated money for domestic propaganda purposes While many of the activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomacy </ORGANIZATION> have been reported extensively in the past, the new study emphasized the role of intelligence experts applying their craft in a domestic operation, instead of the foreign covert operations for which they were trained. A presidential executive order on intelligence activities says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert operations can not include an effort to influence the public opinion or public policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While the transfer of intelligence operatives to domestic agencies is not improper under the order, the activities they perform could violate the order, according to congressional intelligence experts. The report said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, a former high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official who is now national security adviser to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, initiated the recommendation that led to the assignment of former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> propaganda expert <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> group that directed the public diplomacy office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee, has been questioned during the campaign about his role as chief of a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration task force on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy and his association with <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, according to the report, `` was instrumental in facilitating the assignment of intelligence personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> to S @ <ORGANIZATION> LPD </ORGANIZATION> and the expansion of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> resources available to S @ <ORGANIZATION> LPD </ORGANIZATION>,'' the report said. `` On one occasion,'' the report said, `` five intelligence experts from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>'' were assigned to work with the office, then headed by <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>White House Aide Wary Of Proposed Labeling Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants to change the rules governing the labels on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hot dogs but is proceeding over the objections of a White House regulatory official. Department officials thought a proposal to allow processors to include salvaged meat and ground bone in their recipes without explicitly noting the contents in product labels would be in line with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy of stripping away some of the layers of federal regulation. The proposal would allow up to 10 percent mechanically reclaimed meat and tiny bone chips in hot dogs and a number of similar items without explicitly noting the contents in product labels. When animals are slaughtered, most of the red meat is cut or scraped from bones by hand. But a lot of edible tissue clings to the bones and gristle, particularly in neck bones, ribs, joints and other hard-to-scrape places. The bones and the attached meat remnants are put through a grinder and forced through fine sieves. Although most of the bones are strained out, the resulting mixture still contains bits of bone about the size of ground pepper. Under current regulations, the salvaged meat and bone chips are allowed in up to 20 percent of the meat portion of these products, but the labels must state that the products contain the reclaimed mixture. The mixture is known as `` mechanically separated'' meat, or <ORGANIZATION> MSM </ORGANIZATION>, although current regulations describe it as MS -LRB- S -RRB- to acknowledge the species of animal involved. Thus, salvaged meat from a hog would be mechanically separated pork, or MSP. According to a group of meat processors who asked <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for the rule change, no company at present is commercially producing MS -LRB- S -RRB- for consumer products because of `` unwarranted negative connotations'' associated with the term MS -LRB- S -RRB-. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> plan did not set well with <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Plager </PERSON>, administrator of information and regulatory affairs in the Office of Management and Budget. He told <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> in a letter on Aug. 19 that the proposed rule change `` does not appear to be consistent with several of the administration's basic regulatory principles.'' <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> added: `` Nor does it appear that the potential benefits to society of this regulation outweigh the potential cost to society.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, replied that department officials `` do not agree with the conclusions'' set forth by <PERSON> Plager </PERSON>. `` There are compelling reasons for proposing this rule, including the fact that it may produce benefits to society that outweigh societal costs,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> told <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> in a Sept. 6 letter. Copies of the letters by <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> were provided to The Associated Press on Tuesday. Advocates of the rule change contend that consumers wo n't buy products containing the salvaged material if labels inform them about it. The proposal, which began a 60-day rulemaking procedure on Sept. 9, was announced on Monday by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Under various names, MS -LRB- S -RRB- has been authorized for use in the meat products since 1978 and has undergone numerous legal challenges from consumer groups opposed to the salvaged product itself or labeling requirements. According to the plan, which will be open for public comment until Nov. 8, processors would be able to use MS -LRB- S -RRB- to comprise up to 10 percent of the meat in franks, bologna, luncheon meats, sausage and similar products without stating so on product labels. However, the label would have to indicate the percentage of the Recommended Daily Allowance of calcium that the product contained. Calcium is a primary ingredient of bone tissue. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private association that represents meat packers and processors, said in a statement that the use of calcium on labels would be `` a more meaningful and useful term'' to consumers than MS -LRB- S -RRB-, particularly to those who have a calcium deficiency and to a few who are allergic to calcium and should be warned away from such products. In its brief statement, the institute said, `` There is no wholesomeness or safety issue involved'' in the MS -LRB- S -RRB- proposal. But <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> said the assertion that consumers would avoid products labeled as containing MS -LRB- S -RRB- had not been documented in the proposed rule change. `` Furthermore, if one accepts the assertion that some consumers would be reluctant to purchase a product that they know to contain MS -LRB- S -RRB-, why should this information be omitted from the label?'' he said. <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> said that in seeking ways to carry out less burdensome food safety regulations, `` We must also provide consumers with more, rather than less, information about food products so that they may reach informed market decisions.''

<TEXT>
 Hispanic candidates continued to make gains in local, state and federal elections this year and now hold 3,360 elective positions nationwide, said a report released today. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elected </ORGANIZATION> and Appointed Officials said the number of Hispanic elected officials increased by 1.3 percent this year, based on elections from August 1987 to August 1988. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pachon </PERSON>, national director of the association, said measuring the number of Hispanic elected officials `` is a good barometer of Hispanic progress in the political arena.'' The association is a non-partisan, non-profit research organization with more than 3,300 members. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday proclaimed this week as National Hispanic Heritage Week, saying people of Hispanic descent have `` written countless chapters in the unique saga of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Most of the Hispanic elected officials hold municipal and school board seats. Association researcher <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Baquedano </PERSON> said a breakdown of party membership was not available because many local officials do not run as Democrats or Republicans. The association said the largest gains were made in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounting for 1,611 of the elected officials and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coming in second with 595. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has the nation's second-largest Hispanic population, with 4.1 million of the nation's estimated 19.4 million Hispanics <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with the country's largest Hispanic population at 6.6 million, had 466 Hispanic elected officials. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with a third-ranked Hispanic population of 2.1 million, had 68 elected Latino leaders, fewer than states with smaller Hispanic populations such as <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, with 237 elected officials, and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> with 157. Other states with double-digit numbers of elected Hispanics were <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 50; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, 44; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 28; <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, 15; and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 12. Hispanics hold 11 seats in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but none in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 An independent education group says its survey of American schools and education officials indicates there is no shortage of qualified teachers despite frequent talk to the contrary. `` The facts are that there is no teacher shortage,'' <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Feistritzer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. She said the group's `` Teacher Supply and Demand Surveys 1988'' report shows that not only is the alleged teacher shortage unsubstantiated, the teaching market was glutted, with some school districts maintaining large applicant lists. The center's surveys, conducted June 28-Aug. 28, were directed at teacher certification and education offices across the nation, 75 school districts, and more than 1,000 individuals who had been seeking teaching jobs The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> disputed the results, with <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> saying past <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> surveys indicated that vacancies reported during the summer months usually were not filled by new full-time hires in September. `` These school districts say they hired temporaries, or substitutes, reassigned teachers' aides, misassigned teachers, eliminate or reduce course offerings,'' he said. `` We generally find that 20 percent of the schools will increase class size.'' `` This is merely a smokescreen to mask the hiring of temporaries and uncertified teachers,'' he said. <PERSON> Feistritzer </PERSON> said the state boards maintained that all their teachers were certified and noted that many had a policy of placing all new hires on a probationary or temporary status. She acknowledged that the surveys found a shortage in bilingual and special education teachers, but ascribed the outcry over a teacher shortage partly to political considerations. `` As long as you keep presenting a crisis, you've got control over what happens to solve it,'' she said. `` And I do think the unions have held onto this prediction _ it does give them control over who gets into the profession.'' The center's surveys also found: _ Teachers are not leaving the profession at the rate predicted and many who left the field are trying to re-enter It cited <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> data showing a decrease in retirements from 2.4 percent in 1985-86 to 2.2 percent in 1986-87. AFT figures also indicated that 53 percent of new hires in 1987-88 were re-entering teachers, up from the 50 percent in 1986-87. _ Data from the school districts indicate that recent college graduates comprise 50 percent to 60 percent of applicants for teaching positions, at least 20 percent are former teachers trying to re-enter the field or are substitute or part-time teachers seeking full-time status; and at least 4 percent are people making mid-career changes or retirees wanting to become teachers _ Those applying and getting hired are older, highly educated, academically able and experienced _ The average age of those responding to the center's job bank advertisements for `` qualified teachers'' was 38, with 40 percent being 40 or older Thirty-five percent of those hired were 40 or older. _ Half of those job applicants responding were willing to teach in rural areas, and another 46 percent were willing to teach in inner city schools Sixty-eight percent of those who applied and were not hired said the market was glutted; there were no vacancies or too many applicants.

 Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> says his decision to join a conservative think tank in January when he leaves <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't mean he's leaving politics completely. The nine-term <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressman, who earlier had said he would not seek a 10th House term, said Tuesday his position as a distinguished fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> would be `` another phase'' in his career. `` I'm not going to be in public office but I will be doing things before -LRB- congressional -RRB- committees, lecturing, writing, speaking and staying active in support of those policies and issues and ideas that I have been associated with for a number of years,'' he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who for nearly 18 years has represented <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 31st Congressional District around <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, announced earlier this year that he would retire from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the end of this term. At the time, he was waging an unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He was mentioned as a possible running mate for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and made no secret of the fact that he would accept the job gladly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> instead selected Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he would keep his political action committee running so he will have a hand in helping the candidates he supports. He also plans to continue working for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, `` and then see what happens.'' `` I expect that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win, and what the future holds, I do n't know,'' he said. `` But I think this is a good place from which to be active in public policy and keep my options open. So I'm not ruling anything in or out.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 53, in the past has been a guest lecturer at the foundation and has written articles for the foundation's quarterly journal, <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. The fellowship is slated to last at least two years, he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is a former all-pro quarterback for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chargers </ORGANIZATION> and the Buffalo Bills. He first won his congressional seat in 1970. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he became the architect of many economic proposals, including the 1981 supply-side tax cuts, urban enterprise zones and a bill passed last year that enables inner-city poor people living in public housing to purchase their apartments.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is releasing $ 188 million in overdue <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> after becoming convinced that the world body has reformed some administrative and budgetary procedures. At the same time, the White House said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to work out `` a multi-year'' repayment plan involving some $ 520 million in arrearages that have piled up in recent years because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dissatisfaction with the way the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> was run. `` In announcing these decisions, the president called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to continue progress in areas where reform remains incomplete,'' spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday. `` The president reiterated the commitment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to assist the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in its reform program as well as in its new peace keeping efforts,'' he said. In addition to the roughly $ 520 million in late dues payments, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in arrears to the tune of $ 111.8 million in the assessments it is supposed to pay toward the separate <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace keeping budget. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays 25 percent of the cost of running the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and 31 percent of the cost of the peace keeping operations. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to visit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for two days later this month, and will address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 26. He also will meet with a number of foreign leaders while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Considering the financial burden the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shoulders for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, both the administration and a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have concluded there has been too little accountability from the U.N. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> `` has made progress'' toward streamlining and improving budget-making procedures and cracking down on the hiring of temporary employees for the secretariat. He also said that where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests are concerned, the `` political environment'' had improved. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters as he left <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision `` is a very positive development which I very much welcome and which alleviates our difficulties. Of course, it is not the end of our financial problems, but it will alleviate them very much.'' In an earlier statement issued on his behalf, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said, `` Until the outstanding contributions by all member states are paid, the organization will continue to operate with inadequate current income and virtually without reserves.'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s actions `` breathe new life into our hopes for world peace.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decision appears to signal a new era of cooperation rather than confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The only question is whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the vision and the fortitude to reverse course and follow the president's lead.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will release $ 44 million, which was withheld in fiscal 1988, and $ 144 million which was withheld in fiscal 1989. He will request full funding of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1990, which amounts to approximately $ 476 million.'' The $ 44 million will be released immediately, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, while the $ 144 million that had been earmarked in fiscal 1989, beginning Oct. 1, will be set free after the first of next month. The spokesman noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required the president to determine that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had made reforms, `` including cutbacks in the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- secretariat, the hiring of temporary employees'' and improved budgeting procedures. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was convinced that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had made progress in instituting reforms and that the president noted the increasing peace keeping role of the world body in such hot spots as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` We have seen in the last six months some important reforms in terms of the budget and hiring practices, and so forth, and so that has been a determining factor,'' he said. `` During the seven and a half years of this administration, the president has sought to change the political environment,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Although the reform is incomplete, the progress is striking,'' he said. The aim, he said, was to `` prod the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to become an even greater force for peace throughout the world.'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, had said in late July that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hoped to pay $ 188 million of its debt to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> before the year was out to help prevent the world body from running out of money at a time of heightened peace keeping activities. Testifying July 29 before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said that if progress were reached at resolving such world problems as Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, a transition to independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and theVietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> could face an annual peace keeping bill of more than $ 1.5 billion. `` All of these are important to the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and all are likely to involve the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> significantly,'' he said at the time. `` This increase in activity takes place at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is facing a very tight cash situation.''

<HEAD>Senators Bow To Political Reality In Scrapping Medicaid Abortion
Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> abandoned an effort to expand federal coverage for Medicaid abortions in the face of strong opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in July had voted 73-19 to allow federal financing for Medicaid abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest, but it backed down on Tuesday in a bow to political reality. Under current law, federal spending for Medicaid abortions is permitted only if the procedure is needed to save a woman's life. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its support for that policy last week, and in the process rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal for rape and incest exceptions. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had promised to veto a $ 140 billion spending bill containing all the fiscal 1989 money for the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and Education if it came to him with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s abortion provision. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday voted 47-43 to kill a motion insisting on the expanded Medicaid abortion coverage it had approved earlier. `` It's stand up and be counted time,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., the chief proponent of expanded Medicaid coverage `` We're going to see how politically expedient we want to be,'' added Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., sponsor of the provision adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in July Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the subcommittee that handled the spending bill, told his colleagues it would be futile to resist the will of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and White House `` We're talking about a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that we're 50 votes short in. We're talking about a president that's going to veto the bill. We're talking about a clock that's ticking,'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said. Countered Exon: `` Sometimes I think we quiver and retreat all too soon.'' It took <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> two tries to kill <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>'s motion insisting on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> abortion position. He lost the first vote 46-44 but prevailed on the second, 47-43. The outcome was hailed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-To-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as `` a sharp setback for the pro-abortion movement'' and those groups, who label themselves pro-choice, had to agree. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said `` politics played a heavy role'' in the vote. `` Arms got twisted so that our friends voted against us,'' she said. `` They deserted us in the interest of pragmatic politics. It's clear they did n't want this bill to be held up.'' `` We are terribly disappointed,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` These are clearly cases that cry out for public funding.'' Anti-abortion forces got a big boost last week from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who wrote a letter to congressional leaders reiterating his veto threat. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language would permit the use of federal funds for the slaughter of unborn children, depriving the innocent of the most basic of civil rights _ the right to life,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the letter. `` I urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote to protect the lives of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unborn children.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> charged that the administration was trying `` to use their last gasp and their last piece of political capital'' to deny abortions to rape and incest victims. Fourteen states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> pay for Medicaid abortions, but they receive federal reimbursement only in life-threatening cases.

<HEAD>Rules On Underground Tanks Seek To Prevent Groundwater
Contamination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of operations, ranging from corner service stations to giant oil companies, are being subjected to the first federal rules aimed at preventing contamination of groundwater by underground tanks. Almost 2 million tanks, roughly 97 percent of them holding gasoline or some other petroleum product, are covered by a 370-page set of regulations released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The rules apply to new tanks starting in December, but give owners until December 1998 to bring all existing tanks up to the new standards. The rules require protection against corrosion, either electrical devices or plastic liners for steel tanks or use of non-steel tanks; leak detection systems, which may be inventory record-keeping in some cases if an annual tightness test is performed; and devices to prevent spills and overfilling. Existing tanks gradually will come under the regulations, the oldest tanks first. Tanks that are 25 years old or of unknown age will have to get a leak detection system by December 1989. Tanks may be exempted from the rules if a corrosion expert certifies that they will not corrode in the particular soil they're in, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> expects this to be rare Home heating oil tanks and fuel tanks of less than 1,100 gallons for non-commercial home or farm use are not covered. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> surveys have shown that anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent of the 750,000 installations with tanks are having or have had a significant leak, and anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 tanks are involved in some kind of cleanup project. Concerned that a gallon of gasoline can contaminate a million gallons of groundwater, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 required the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to adopt the regulations and two years later allocated $ 500 million to help with cleanups. The agency said it tightened provisions for piping from an April 1987 draft because of growing evidence that many leaks start there, rather than in the tank itself. However, environmental groups criticized the agency for failing to require double-walled tanks or other double-barrier containment systems for gasoline tanks. The agency specified their use only for some 60,000 chemical tanks. `` It will cost a lot more to clean up after the fact than it would to put in double-walled tanks to begin with,'' said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gopnik </PERSON>, an engineer with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` EPA is leaving the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply of drinking water vulnerable to petroleum contamination,'' said staff scientist <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> of the Environmental Defense Fund. `` The regulations are designed to minimize their impact on the regulated community, not to protect the environment and the public from the hazards of petroleum contamination,'' she said. Although the agency did n't perform a cost-benefit calculation, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for solid waste and emergency response, said that `` secondary containment is quite expensive'' and would add unspecified billions to the cost of the final regulations. `` Whether you're mom and pop or <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, it does n't make a lot of sense to keep a leaking gasoline tank in the ground. The liability is enormous,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. A service station with three 5,000-gallon tanks might have to spend $ 3,000 to $ 8,000 on a leak detection system and $ 10,000 to $ 48,000 on an electrical rust-prevention system, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated. The agency estimated the benefits from reduced spills in future years at $ 73 billion in today's dollars, with costs to tank owners at $ 54 billion. A dozen states have tank programs of their own, and any state may operate a more stringent regulatory program than the national rules if the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> approves. The regulations become effective 90 days from publication in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, expected any day.

 As President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> follows Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, he is taking his campaign for the Republican ticket to a state he carried narrowly in 1980 and resoundingly four years ago. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was flying today to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>, a shipping center on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, for a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and then on to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to address 1,000 guests at a $ 250-a-plate fund-raising dinner. `` The general thrust of both of these speeches is support for the Republican ticket, acknowledgement of the economic successes of this administration, discussion of the differences between liberals and conservatives,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The first rally speech may focus a little more on the economy and the second one a little more on military strength,'' the spokesman said. `` But they will both be traditional political speeches, covering the themes that the president has discussed in the past.'' The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until the Nov. 8 election. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates who will benefit from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> events include Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, seeking a second term against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the wife of former Gov. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>; and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, opposed by State Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION> as he seeks his third term.

 A new effort to end the impasse between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> over the terms of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to strategic bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> ended with no apparent narrowing of differences. `` There has been nothing to justify my saying that we are closer together,'' <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> told reporters after a 45-minute meeting Tuesday with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The major issue in the talks is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compensation to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for use of the bases. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who also plans meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and congressional leaders during his visit, said the two sides are not far apart on a cash aid figure but that there has been no agreement on other components of an aid package. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> declined to provide details of the aid figures being discussed but congressional sources and reports in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> indicated he is asking for about $ 1.2 billion annually over the next two years. This would represent a sizeable increase over the $ 180 million a year to which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been committed since 1983. In addition to cash aid, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> also is said to be seeking trade concessions, debt relief and other `` soft components,'' as <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> described them. The administration reportedly has offered $ 360 million yearly in 1989 and 1990 in addition to food assistance and other concessions for a total of just under $ 500 million. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said last week the Filipino demands were `` out of bounds,'' adding that `` we will be patient and we will be persistent'' in efforts to overcome the impasse. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the meeting with <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>. The talks revolve around the terms for continued American use of <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON>, two of the most important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The ongoing talks involve other issues, including the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons at the bases, but most of the attention has focused on compensation. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said a substantial aid increase is warranted partly to correct what he suggested was a historical injustice, contending that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used military facilities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for more than 70 years without compensating Filipino authorities. In other countries, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided aid immediately after establishing military bases. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said American analysts have concluded that the bases benefit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more than the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> because `` there is no external threat to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> today.''

<HEAD>Pesticide Safety Bill Moving in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm lawmakers are moving to impose an eight-year deadline for the completion of safety research on hundreds of chemicals that are used to protect crops from damaging pests. The plan, aimed at toughening federal regulation because of growing concern about potential health hazards, won <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> apprval Tuesday on a voice vote and now heads to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Under the legislation, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> would have eight years to complete its safety reviews of hundreds of pesticides. The agency, working under no deadline, has been finishing reviews of about two dozen chemicals a year since the mid-1970s when it took over the job from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation also would largely end government payments to chemical companies to buy up supplies of recalled pesticides. Such payments have totaled $ 20 million so far. Critics say the cost of these `` indemnities'' has caused the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to drag its feet in proceeding with the safety reviews. Under the bill, chemical companies and the agency would share the cost of storing and disposing of the pesticides, and manufacturers would bear the costs of conducting the reviews. Lawmakers have been stymied since 1983 in efforts to reauthorize the 1949 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act -LRB- <LOCATION> FIFRA </LOCATION> -RRB-. They had been saying no action was likely until next year. Committee approval of the latest bill, however, signaled an effort to send legislation to the president before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next month. Few, however, expressed much enthusiasm for what they called a modest effort in which the lack of far-reaching features could prove the key to political success. Committee aides issued a bill summary headlined `` <LOCATION> FIFRA </LOCATION> Lite.'' `` I doubt very much that there's a man on the dais who thinks that we're doing the right thing, but we're doing what we have to do,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told the committee. He said recalled pesticides currently in storage should be burned but that lawmakers lacked the political will to push through legislation requiring it. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the problem was that no lawmaker wanted the incinerator in his or her home district. Environmentalists were concerned about the absence of any provision calling for federal regulation of pesticides in ground water, which represents the basic drinking supply for half of all Americans. But they said the legislation could be worse. `` Like the first law of medicine, they have done no harm,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hind </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an organization founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> that has waged a long pesticide safety battle. The group issued a report Tuesday saying a search of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> records showed 73 pesticides have been found in ground water in 34 states, a slight increase over previous reports from the agency. `` Putting off action on ground water is better than doing something awful on ground water, which is what they would have done,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckle </PERSON>, lobbyist from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Pesticide regulation in this country is a public health scandal that affects each and every consumer,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> counsel for government affairs. `` This clean piece of legislation shows that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is serious about tackling the problem once and for all this year.'' Farmers and exterminators use some 2.6 billion pounds of pesticides in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> every year. Perhaps 40,000 products are sold, but they are basically formulations of 656 active ingredients. An outgrowth of World War II chemical warfare research, pesticides have played a major part in increasing crop yields and placing better-looking farm products on grocers' shelves. But some of the chemicals have been found to cause cancer and other severe health problems in laboratory animals.

 Airline pilots must fly when passengers want to travel: early in the morning, late at night, across continents and oceans, regardless of the vagaries of delays and bad weather. Despite these grueling schedules, however, dangerous fatigue is not inevitable. This final story in a three-part AP Extra series, `` 6 Miles Up and Sleepy,'' examines ways of coping with sleepiness in the cockpit.

 One often-proposed solution to the dangers of pilot fatigue is legalization of a remedy that is obvious and widely practiced, but forbidden _ naps in the cockpit. Passengers may blanch at the idea of their captain snoozing while they watch a movie six miles above the Earth. But sleep researchers contend this is a sensible way to cope with the flight crew exhaustion caused by late-night arrivals, early-morning departures and time-zone crossings. While air travel is generally safe, the experts say it could be safer still if human frailties were considered in the design of flight rules, pilot schedules and the planes themselves. Some in the flying business, however, are reluctant to acknowledge fatigue as a concern. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has publically voiced skepticism that sleepy pilots create a hazard in the skies. The airlines seem to fear that proposed rule changes would make scheduling more difficult, and some pilots fret that they would lose the large blocks of free time they now enjoy. Industry observers, moreover, contend that one of the most powerful impediments to change is the very image of the airline pilot: fit, trim and male, calm, confident and capable. Surely such a person can deal with a little thing like sleepiness. `` There is a widely held belief that mental toughness, good management or physical fitness will overcome sleepiness. That is categorically incorrect,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinges </PERSON>, a sleep researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. `` Your brain still needs sleep, and you get yoursef into serious trouble when you try to tough that out.'' Several approaches are being considered: cockpits that monitor their operators, medicines that help flight crews sleep when off duty, schedules that figure in the time of departure and the direction of travel as well as the length of the work day. But one of the easiest and simplest solutions is the nap. `` It's common knowledge that people are napping in the cockpit because they are so tired,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON>, a sleep scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> NASA-Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We are looking very closely at the potential safety benefits of allowing limited napping in the seat.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> encourages its crews to nap on long cargo flights, and some foreign countries, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> among them, allow sleeping in airline cockpits. Under <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rules, however, napping is considered careless and reckless operation of the aircraft. Yet on the long mid-flight stretches across continents and oceans, pilots have little to do but monitor their dials. Nature takes its course. In interviews with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, pilots reported frightening instances of awakening to find their two colleagues sound asleep as the airliner cruises through the night skies. <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON> proposes that naps be carefully scheduled so each member of the flight crew anticipates a rest period. `` Napping will be very helpful, if it's ever implemented,'' agreed <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carskadon </PERSON>, a sleep researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It makes so much more sense to schedule it in than to all of a sudden have all three members of the flight crew asleep because no one is scheduled to sleep.'' Far more difficult, the experts agree, is improving pilot schedules. Rules set by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and union agreements dictate how many hours a day pilots can be on duty and in the air. But the standards allow myriad permutations of day and night departures and arrivals that often leave crews out of synchronism with their internal circadian clocks. `` I think pilot scheduling is as good as it can be right now reflecting what we know,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. `` As we understand it better, the scheduling, I think, will reflect that.'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> and airline officials are awaiting results of research now being conducted jointly by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Beginning this fall, <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON> and other researchers will fly with pilots on long, over-ocean routes, monitoring their body temperatures and brain waves as they fly through the night. The resulting advice may not please either pilots or airlines. Pilots, often vehement critics of schedules, might find their flight time spread over a longer calendar period, eliminating the intense two to three weeks of flying that gives them the rest of the month off.

 Airlines, already pinched by deregulatory competition and a pilot shortage, may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced schedules. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s, when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a day. Among those who think they can be improved is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, a sleep researcher on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` An arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory rest time that does n't take into account circadian factors is simply not 20th century,'' he said. `` We know that an hour of sleep is not an hour of sleep, depending on when you take it. One of the biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately.'' The experts contend that schedules should consider the time of departure, the number of time zones crossed and the direction of travel. -LRB- The body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east than east to west. -RRB- Another part of the problem is the plane itself. The modern cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber. The lights are dim. The seats are comfortable. The air rushes past with a soothing hum. Planes are so automated that they quite literally fly themselves. Except while landing and taking off, there is often little for crew members to do. The newest planes do n't even require a flight engineer, so standard crew size is being reduced from three members to two. Some pilots and sleep experts complain that this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off. `` The fewer people in the cockpit, the fewer safeguards you have,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore-Ede </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, a sleep expert at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's easier for two people to nod off than three.'' But <PERSON> Delmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> administrator, asserts just the opposite is likely: `` If there are only two in the cockpit, both know that they ca n't rely on a third person, so they are more attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to allow themselves to go to sleep.'' <PERSON> Fadden </PERSON>, who establishes design requirements for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and 767, said, `` We ca n't do a lot about the fact that the crew might be fatigued. What we try to do is make the airplane tolerant of the crew's reaction.'' This means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored, drowsy, inattentive pilots. If something goes wrong, such as a generator failure, the plane automatically compensates without waiting for the crew to act. <PERSON> Fadden </PERSON> said some planes being built will monitor their crews. Alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes. Such a lapse of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse. Another possible solution, used by the British during the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> crisis, is a drug to help pilots sleep before night flights. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON>, a psychologist at <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military is experimenting with the drug temazepam. All of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather, equipment failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster. `` We run a very safe air transportation system,'' said <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>. `` But we are pushing people harder. We know from anecdotal data that people are not as alert as they should be. They are falling asleep in some circumstances. I think it's appropriate that we re-examine the way we approach these things.''

 Imagine this work week: Leave <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at 8:15 p.m. and fly 5 -LCB- hours to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Rest the second day, but leave late that night _ at 1 a.m., which is 4 a.m. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> time _ for the 8 -LCB- - hour flight to <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, where you wait 90 minutes then fly three more hours to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> After a day's rest in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, you do the same thing in reverse, landing back in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> seven days after you left. Or consider this schedule: Leave <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> at 6:15 a.m., fly two hours to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, leave an hour later on a 4 -LCB- - hour flight to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Twelve hours after landing, you're back in the cockpit, flying all night to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and, after an hour on the ground, on to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, arriving back on the East Coast 26 hours after you left. It is schedules like these, the first flown by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crews, the second by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, that pilots say wear them down, sometimes leaving them groggy and prone to mistakes. `` What we're doing with these schedules is taking human beings and saying let's get the maximum out of them,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> captain interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be identified out of concern for his job. `` As a result we've got crews who are in rough shape out there.'' Yet another <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> captain who makes trans-Pacific flights said his most recent six-day tour of duty went like this: 10:15 a.m. _ <LOCATION> Arrive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for 11:35 jumbo jet trip to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Go through paper work, check flight plans, weather, fuel, passenger load. Flight promises to be particularly heavy, requiring unscheduled fuel stop in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Several passengers fail to show, making extra stop unnecessary, but threatened schedule change and a mixup getting departure clearance mean plane is pushed away from the gate 40 minutes late. 12:35 p.m. _ After starting the engines, taxiing out to runway, going over checklist, plane takes off. After liftoff, `` we run a sterile cockpit until top of climb,'' the captain says. `` That means all business, no chitchat, no PA announcements. We check the instruments, seeing that the systems are running as we expect, and check the inertial navigation system to make sure it is tracking with ground navigation aids.'' The plane leaves the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and passes over the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. From then on, the flight is routine. The crew makes regular position checks, watches the navigational instruments, listens to an emergency frequency, chats with other planes and eats. -LRB- Crew meals are better than coach but not as fancy as first class. -RRB- As plane approaches <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> about 10 hours after takeoff, there are more checklists and instructions from air traffic controllers. `` You have to screw up your level of concentration, because insidiously you often are not aware of your fatigue,'' the captain says. 2:48 p.m. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> time, following day _ Plane lands at <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Pilot's cockpit time between leaving the terminal in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and parking in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, `` block to block'' as they say, is 11 hours and 33 minutes. The crew is on duty for 30 minutes more, finishing up paper work. They clear customs and immigration and are picked up by a bus for the 15-minute ride to a hotel. The captain stays up a couple of hours more, having dinner, reading and unwinding. He finally goes to sleep at 8 p.m., which is 5 a.m. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> time. He sleeps five or six hours, wakes up well before dawn. He has breakfast, reads and exercises. At noon, he tries unsuccessfully to sleep again. 5 p.m. _ Bus picks up crew for 6:30 departure for <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Before this tour is over, the pilot flies back to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, then returns to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. When he gets home, he sleeps 13 hours straight. Such schedules are relatively common and uniformly grueling. The problem, say officials, is that to schedule the 18,500 daily flights, to get people where they want when they want, to remain competitive and cost-effective, some pilots must fly through the night across multiple time zones then come back eight hours later and do it again. Typically, each airline presents its monthly flights to both human schedulers and computers programmed to consider the vagaries of economics, fuel consumption, regulations, contracts and human and equipment limits. Men and machines come up with possibilities that are double-checked. `` We take a look at it based on the safety issues,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hof </PERSON>, head of flight operations at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` The computer, in optimizing the costs in crewing the series of flights, will take a look at the duty time available and cram a lot of flying into that.'' Once approved, the crew lists are put up for bid. The pilots bid for schedules based on their desirability and hourly pay rate. Those who fly the bigger, faster planes get paid more. Pilot wages range from about $ 70,000 a year to a top of $ 160,000. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the average pilot is in the cockpit about 80 hours a month and spends another 80 hours on duty, preparing for flights or waiting for passengers to load and unload. This total of 160 hours is crammed into an average of 16 days a month. Management and pilots agree there is little way to avoid some of the overnight, multiple time zone schedules that test pilots' endurance `` You're not going to work it all out,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> captain and chairman of the pilots union's Human Performance Committee. `` We work silly hours and that's just the way the business is.''

 The Burmese army _ tough, disciplined and hitherto loyal _ has emerged as the key power broker in an increasingly chaotic country where the authoritarian government is besieged by a popular revolt. Only a few of the 186,000 soldiers have defected to join masses of protesters demanding the military-backed government step down so an interim administration can supervise the first multiparty elections in 26 years. `` It's the only really organized force in the country. Whoever gains its loyalty controls the state,'' <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> specialist <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> said. `` I think the army is still 100 percent behind -LRB- former President -RRB- Ne Win and -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. They're in the ramparts and I do n't see any shift in their loyalty,'' the American expert said in an interview. The government and sole political party could not have withstood the last seven weeks of massive demonstrations without solid military backing, analysts say. The army even has been willing to gun down unarmed protesters. The civil service, meanwhile, is bolting. The experts speculate, however, that the military might have splintered without behind-the-scenes maneuvering by retired leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, architect of both the 1962 coup and the military's power and privilege. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say military units are stockpiling food, fuel and other vital supplies that are fast disappearing. The army and other agents of the state have been reported encouraging violence, looting and rumors _ perhaps hoping to justify a military crackdown led by <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>'s old guard, which includes <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> diplomats say opposition leaders Tin Oo and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, both widely respected officers who earlier broke with <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, could win the military to their side. A third possibility is a coup by `` Young Turks'' in combat commands who are known to have grown disillusioned with corruption, inefficiency and the high living of the elite, while troops are sent to battle rebels armed with rifles that jam in the tropical rains. The sole certainty is that a violent confrontation between the army and the opposition would result in great bloodshed. The few weapons available to students, workers and allied groups are knives, clubs and `` jinglees'' _ homemade, poisoned projectiles. The army _ although one of the poorest-equipped in world _ has been described by military attaches in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> as `` tough, lean and mean.'' The ranks of its eight light infantry divisions are filled by some of the best foot soldiers in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, second only to those of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The army also has been imbued with what <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> scholar and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lissak </PERSON> calls a sense of `` historic mission.'' Military men, including Ne Win, gained prestige by leading the struggle against British colonialism, and upon independence in 1948 found a power vacuum they moved to fill. The army also provided protection for the <PERSON> Burman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> heartland against ethnic insurgents pressing inward from the frontier. `` Faced by a plethora of enemies, communist and ethnic separatists, and supported by a weak and uncertain civilian government, the army leadership developed the ability to function independently of civilian control,'' wrote British scholar <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> in `` The State in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>.'' Armed with definite ideas about how to run the country, Ne Win's clique seized power in 1962 Retired colonels were charged with running government departments and ex-generals became ministers. The results were political repression and economic ruin. `` We know the end of the story now, but in the 1960s the military were looked upon as saviors,'' <PERSON> Lissak </PERSON> said. They became a privileged group, with extra pay, medical care, survivor benefits and jobs upon retirement _ special benefits they can have no desire to lose.

<HEAD>$1 Million Gift to Endow Football Coach's Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has endowed faculty chairs in numerous esoteric fields. Now the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school's football coach will join that elite company as the <ORGANIZATION> Joel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smilow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON>, a 1954 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate and president, chairman and chief executive officer of Stamford-based <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had donated $ 1 million to endow the head football coach's job, the first endowed position in the athletic department. `` Excellence in football is not a core objective of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> or any other great institution of higher education,'' said <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON>, whose college football career was limited to intramural touch football. `` However, it is my belief that football is an integral part of the very broad objective of attracting, educating and motivating persons with the potential to become tomorrow's leaders, irrespective of the field of endeavor which they choose to pursue.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> officials would not release the salary of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s football coach, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cozza </PERSON>, who is entering his 24th season and has compiled a record of 139 wins, 70 losses and 4 ties. School officials also would not say how much of the endowment will be used to finance the position. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Benno </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON>'s gift `` will help carry forward the glorious tradition of varsity football at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>.'' But the gift provoked mild disapproval among some students. `` The money could go to something else,'' said junior <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Archley </PERSON>. `` I ca n't see what else <PERSON> Carm </PERSON> <PERSON> Cozza </PERSON> could do that would warrant such money.'' <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON> brushed aside the criticism, saying the gift would allow the university to use money from the coach's salary in other areas. As an undergraduate, <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON> broadcast <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> football games as sports director for <ORGANIZATION> WYBC </ORGANIZATION>, the college radio station, and said during a telephone interview that his secret ambition had been `` to be a Brent <PERSON> Musburger </PERSON>,'' the sports announcer for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` I love <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and I love football,'' he said. Although football is generally considered a more genteel affair in the Ivy League than in powerhouse leagues like the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, Southeastern, Big Eight and Pacific-10 Conference, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> boasts among its alumni <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who played as a running back for the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> after graduating in 1966; and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, a 1982 graduate who played for the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dolphins </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> also has more football victories than any other college in the nation _ 743, followed by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s 684. And <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> has had 118 players named All-Americans.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has got a hankering to turn back the clock about half a century so he can be a teen-ager again. That's what he told a roadside crowd of school children and youths who gathered in this rural town to watch his campaign motorcade go by Tuesday. Speaking on his limousine loudspeaker, he told them, `` I must confess, I wish I was about a junior, maybe a senior in high school, because I see the next decade strong, and I see the next decade a challenge.'' The 300 young people standing on the grounds of <ORGANIZATION> Tipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> cheered with delight at the vice president's impromptu remarks and the sight of the long motorcade with security agents and official looking entourage. Two teachers said the high school was notified by campaign officials about 15 minutes ahead of time that the motorcade would pass by, so the students, along with some younger children from an elementary school, came out to see the excitement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to them for a few minutes, saying he just wanted to see the home of the undefeated <ORGANIZATION> Tipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> football team. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he likes to get out to these local communities to `` understand the heartbeat of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' while `` a lot of people are sitting back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or some university'' wanting to `` knock the system.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concluded by pledging himself to work for a more peaceful and prosperous world. He shook hands with the children who surged forward, and then his motorcade continued down the country road. But it was only a few miles before the vice president had an encounter with the `` you ca n't please everybody'' department. There was another quick stop, this one at a corner convenience store called Break Time. It seems the vice president was getting a little hungry on the long drive from <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he had a rally, to <ORGANIZATION> Whiteman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, where his plane awaited. So <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and their <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> retinue trooped into the little store to pick up a couple of slices of pizza and some soft drinks. The vice president told the young woman cashier he was starving as he pulled out his wallet and paid for the food. Outside, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> briefly shook hands with a few curious onlookers, a local police officer was informing other members of the entourage that all was not well at the <ORGANIZATION> Butterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> restaurant next door. It seems the proprietor had been told to expect a lunch stop by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brigade before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veered off to the convenience store. `` He's got that place all set up for the vice president,'' the officer said. `` Tell him thanks a lot.'' Asked later aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two whether he was aware of the perceived slight, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed surprise, but said: `` We were n't looking for a big fancy restaurant I did n't want a fancy meal.''

 She might not be any match for them on the field, but Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> knocked out those big mean football boys in the television ratings. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> vainly put up college football games against `` The Miss America Pageant'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, but they ended up way downfield in 60th and 62nd places, respectively, while Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was No. 1. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that between 50 million and 55 million viewers watched all or part of the pageant on Saturday night, giving it a rating of 22.3 and a 44 share, higher than last year's 20.4 and 42, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The highest-rated Miss America Pageant was in 1986. It got a 23.0 rating and a 44 share. Each rating point represents 886,000 homes with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. After the pageant, last week's top prime-time shows were: `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Baby Boom'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Monday Night Football _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, the Bob Hope Special on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Full House'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in its Tuesday time period, `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and `` 227'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Baby Boom'' is a preview of a new show, based on the movie by that name and starring <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as an executive who inherits a baby. It was slotted after `` Golden Girls'' and before Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said the `` Baby Boom'' rating was the highest this season for the network in that time period. For the week that ended Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won with an average prime-time rating of 12.6 to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 11.2 and CBS' 9.3. The evening news race was even tighter than usual, but it was an unusual week because of the <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> telethon and football. The result was `` CBS Evening News'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' tying with a rating of 9.5. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.4. Each of the three got a 20 share. CBS' news was carried by 98 percent of its stations, 97 percent for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and 96 percent for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> because of `` Monday Night Football'' on the network. There might have been some effect from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> CBS affiliate's move of the `` CBS Evening News'' to 6:30, opposite <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight.'' `` NBC Nightly News'' is on its own in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 7 p.m. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> represents about 7 percent of the total television audience. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> recorded the highest rating yet for its prime-time series when `` America's Most Wanted'' got a 9.0 and ranked 43rd among all network shows. Two other <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> shows, `` Married ... with Children'' and `` 21 Jump Street'' also landed high enough in the ratings to out-rank several network programs.

<HEAD>Gilbert: Third Force 5 Hurricane This Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weather officials called <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a meterologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, reported an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on Tuesday. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was barreling toward <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. The previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he said. With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> also was one of the largest. But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall size, said center meterologist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last month, was probably about half that size, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records. The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, leaving $ 1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead. A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, however. That storm hit <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Sept. 8 and killed more than 6,000 people. Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet. The storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path _ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities. <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>'s storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _ shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and windows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed. `` Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. `` The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air in the center. If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then you can have a severe hurricane.'' Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90. The weakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of 74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.

<HEAD>Drought Hurts Yield But Some Spots Have Bumper Crop</HEAD>

 This summer's drought stunted corn, wheat and soybean yields in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, but some farmers in pockets that received rain could reap bumper crops and harvest them two weeks early. `` We've got good, great big ears. I'd say it looks awful good. I figure the yield will be as good as last year, maybe 150 bushels'' an acre, says <LOCATION> Kossuth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farmer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. `` It looks like we'll average a strong 150 bushels per acre out here,'' echoed <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Benken </PERSON>, manager of the Farmer's <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elevator </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wesley </LOCATION>, in north-central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. That's about double the estimated statewide average last year. State by state estimates of corn and bean yields in Monday's September crop report from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said drought damage has not worsened since the August report The corn harvest is estimated at 4.46 billion bushels, a five-year low. More than one-sixth of the crop is in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where the government predicted a harvest of 811.2 million bushels, the smallest in 24 years. <PERSON> Benken </PERSON> said that while most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was baking under the drought, <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> was getting timely rain, including a drenching in the wake of a July 8 tornado that hit about 140 miles southwest. `` The tornado that hit Council Bluffs slowed down when it got out here and gave us 3.5 inches of rain over two and a half days,'' he said. While the corn and bean harvest will be reduced nationwide, other crops showed an increase, according to the report. August rains helped boost the estimated tobacco yield in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> while the cotton crop in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will be the fourth-highest ever. `` We'll probably have a good crop at low prices,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an extension economist in College Station, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, specializing in cotton. The drought was particularly hard on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> wheat farmers, where the government is estimating a yield of 15.6 million bushels, the lowest production since 1959 and down 68 percent from last year. `` Most producers I've talked to say they can hold on for another year,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangin </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But it's going to be tough. A lot of it depends on the drought aid from the government and how they decide to work advance deficiency payments next spring.'' The national soybean harvest was estimated at a 12-year low of 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year but virtually unchanged from the August forecast. However, one expert thought the government's numbers were suspect. `` Generally, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reports will lag on the high side when you have a drought,'' said extension marketing specialist <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutgen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. He said he is more comfortable with private estimates of lower yields. While the drought has shriveled yields, it has also caused the corn crop to mature much faster than usual. Corn normally is n't dry enough for market until about Oct. 1. At the elevator in <LOCATION> Wesley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Benken </PERSON> said farmers are bringing in heavy loads of quality grain. Kossuth County Extension Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Wesley </LOCATION> area had 17 inches of rainfall over the summer in addition to 8 inches of hold-over moisture at planting time. `` Heck, with 25, 27 inches of rain, you can raise corn,'' he said. Other farms in the same county did n't share the wealth of wetness. `` I've heard estimates ranging all the way from 50 bushels up to 175,'' said county soil specialist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gast </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Algona </LOCATION>. Extension economist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> said several factors could lower corn yields below government estimates, including weak stalks. Fragile stalks can topple in wind or rain, making it difficult for mechanical reapers to harvest, he said. The drought has left its mark in other businesses as well. Executives of barge companies that ply the nation's rivers said they had expected to make money in 1988 after struggling for most of the decade because of depressed hauling rates. But drought restrictions have closed some rivers, at least temporarily, and slowed passage through others, as well as limited the number of barges pushed by one tow and the loads they carry. `` Finally this year, people began to make money until <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Nature </PERSON> gave us a lousy deal,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of the American Waterways Operators, a trade group. A study commissioned by the group projected that industry this year will suffer losses of as much as $ 200 million on revenues of $ 1 billion, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, who recorded the `` Ballad of the Green Berets,'' was training Nicaraguan rebels in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and had received death threats before he was shot in the head, a friend said. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, 46, was unconscious and listed in critical but stable condition Tuesday after seven hours of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he was admitted Monday night after being flown from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Physicians were reserving judgment on the possibility of recovery, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwald </PERSON> said. `` Basically, the doctors have said time will tell,'' she said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Faglier </PERSON>, who had lived off-and-on with <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> for two years, said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> had received death threats in the Central American country in recent months. `` People had written ` die gringo' on the walls around the house,'' he said. `` Gunshots had been fired into the house and there were -LRB- threatening -RRB- phone calls.'' The men, who served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> together, had trained Guatemalan soldiers and Contras in firearms use and their work was common knowledge there. The U.S.-backed Contras are fighting to overthrow the leftist Nicaraguan government. `` I'm sure it made us less than popular,'' he said. <PERSON> Faglier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s literary agent, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was wounded once with a handgun Wednesday night or Thursday morning, apparently as he got into a cab during a robbery attempt in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` He resisted,'' <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> said. `` There have been lots of rumors.'' <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, as Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, co-wrote and recorded `` Ballad of the Green Berets'' which was the No. 1 song in the country for five weeks in 1966. The song, a tribute to the Special Forces, sold 9 million singles and albums. Billboard Magazine, a weekly trade publication of the music business, named it the No. 1 single of the year. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> had written the song while recuperating from a leg wound suffered in a booby trap in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where he served periodically from 1965 to 1967. He later made his living writing adventure novels, many of them set in Central America. <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s 30 novels have sold in the millions with the most recent being `` Razor,'' `` Seppuku'' and `` Soldier of <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders U.S. Information Agency to Rewrite `Propaganda' Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal rules that allow officials to brand a documentary movie as propaganda before it is exported must be rewritten because they are unconstitutional, a federal judge has ruled. The ruling is an interim step in a protracted freedom-of-speech dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a group of largely liberal moviemakers who accuse the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of hampering foreign distribution of their films. The moviemakers' attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, on Tuesday hailed the decision as a rejection of a threat by <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> to pull out of an international cultural exchange treaty if the courts rule against the agency. `` -LRB- Wick -RRB- played his bluff and the court did n't take it,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, the public-interest lawyers' group pressing the filmmakers' case But the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement, said it remains committed to the ideals of the cultural exchange treaty, called the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Agreement, which eases export of movies deemed to have educational, scientific or cultural value. `` We are ... very concerned about adverse court rulings which are interfering with our carrying out our treaty obligations faithfully,'' the agency said. The written ruling issued by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tashima </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 9 gives the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> 60 days to rewrite its rules for certifying documentary movies as educational, cultural or scientific. Though the designation is n't needed to export a film, it eases distribution by allowing duty-free sale of movies in 70 countries that have signed the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Agreement or honor it. Acting on an earlier order from <LOCATION> Tashima </LOCATION>, the agency rewrote its rules, including in the new regulations a provision allowing a film to be certified for duty-free export but tagged `` propaganda.'' <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> rejected those rules in May and ordered a second rewrite. The latest ruling is on a request to stay that order pending an appeal to the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The dispute began in 1985, when makers of seven documentary films on subjects ranging from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to nuclear war sued the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>, accusing it of discriminating against movies with liberal themes in issuing certificates under the agreement. Agency officials have denied that politics play a role in certifying movies under the agreement.

 The decision by longtime <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> critic President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to pay $ 700 million in back dues to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will save the world body from bankruptcy next month and keep alive its new peacekeeping force in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision came two weeks before he is to address the 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in his final <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> appearance. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been withholding dues and criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, its Soviet rival has rediscovered the value of the organization and started paying its bills. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> now promotes the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and points a finger at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday authorized the release of $ 188 million _ $ 44 million at once and $ 144 million as soon as funds become available. It appeared to be a last gesture to the world organization, which his administration had steadily denounced as biased and bloated. The president also directed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to work out a plan over several years for repaying $ 520 million in legally required payments to the organization. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision and said `` he will feel more comfortable'' in making his final address But he added: `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is always welcome.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> emphasized that financial uncertainty will continue until more than 70 member states pay their back dues and build up <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reserves. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief in the past has gently criticized some in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the biggest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> donor, for being wary of multilateral diplomacy and considering it an infringement on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> right to act unilaterally in the world arena. Foreign diplomats said recent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> successes in peacemaking and peacekeeping in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Iran-Iraq war and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> appeared to be major factors in persuading the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to release the legal payments it had deliberately withheld. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> especially welcomed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediation of an accord under which more than 100,000 Soviet troops were to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> announced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision Tuesday, saying the government recognizes the increasing <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping role in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -RRB- and the gulf. `` Although the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- reform is incomplete,'' he said, `` the progress is striking.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been demanding more accountability from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for its spending. One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had to put its money where its mouth is ... It is difficult for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue criticizing the organization and withholding funds for vital operations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would be unable to finance the new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in the gulf and pay <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff salaries in October without a substantial payment. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed more than $ 200 million every year by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ about a quarter of the regular budget of $ 800 million. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had been withholding funds for years to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> into political, administrative and budgetary reforms. The administration now says it is satisfied that reforms, although imperfect, are significant and are well under way. That will tide the organization over its worst financial crisis in years, but financial uncertainty will remain until other debtor nations pay their arrears. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget arrears as of July 31 were $ 602 million. Peacekeeping arrears totaled an additional $ 484 million. The top 10 debtor nations at that time were the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently paid virtually all of its arrears, after years of overdue accounts. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been seeking to promote the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as an instrument of a new kind of political thinking and has cited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for withholding dues and opposing multilateralism.

 City officials have come up with a way to lure yuppies out of their Porsches and into buses: a luxury shuttle that offers cushy seats, videos, wine and bagels. The 10-mile service from downtown to <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is scheduled to begin next month. City Councilman <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON>, who dreamed up the deluxe bus, hopes it will ease freeway jams by attracting lawyers and other professionals wh would rather use the time spent traveling downtown to catch up on business than on shifting gears. `` What lawyers sell is their time,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president. `` So if half an hour or an hour of time can be spent working rather than dodging cars, than that's time well spent.'' For $ 7.50 each way, the 18-passenger shuttles will provide cellular phones, televisions, video casette recorders and facsimile machines, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> APT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, which won the contract for the route. Attendants will serve coffee and bagels in the morning and soft drinks and wine in the afternoon. But you ca n't please everyone. One lawyer detected a potential drawback. `` It definitely would be nice and less tense,'' said attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>. `` But my guess is that most lawyers, like me, would be concerned about the down time waiting for the next bus.''

 A businessman and a scientist want to put a three-armed robot in chains. The robot unveiled Tuesday at a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> laboratory was billed as the perfect worker for the jewelry industry. It is so dexterous it can handle delicate gold chain, solder on parts and delicately twist the clasps on and off. `` A person right now who gets tired after an eight-hour shift can do an average of one -LRB- chain -RRB- a minute,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Datseris </PERSON>, an associate professor of mechanical engineering. The robot can do two or three a minute, stacking them neatly on a post as it finishes them, said <PERSON> Datseris </PERSON>, who helped develop the machine. The robot will help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jewelry manufacturers compete with imports, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Wiesner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, the chain maker that funded the development work. `` I had this envisioned in my mind for a couple of years,'' said <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>, who earned a degree in mechanical engineering at <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` I had the mechanics down pretty well, but I needed help with the electronics.'' The university designed much of the electronics, two of the robot's arms, and the computer program that runs the robot. The robot's main arm came from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. It has cost about $ 100,000 so far to develop the machine, <PERSON> Datseris </PERSON> said. At least six months more is needed before the robot is ready for patent, said <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Blackmun: Future Of Court May Be Foretold This Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES W. BURTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> says the ideological bent of his newest colleague, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, is critical to the court's direction and might threaten his Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing abortion. Another good indicator of what the future holds, the 79-year-old jurist suggested Tuesday, will be the civil rights case of <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, set for oral argument after the court begins its term Oct. 3 `` I think the outcome of that case will be of some significance as to the movement of the court during the balance of the 20th century,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> told law students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. The court stunned civil rights groups in April when it announced it wanted to use the <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> case to re-examine a 12-year-old precedent that held a private, all-white school violated the law in refusing to consider black applicants based on their race. The 1976 case allowed damages to be awarded against private parties who discriminate on the basis of race in deciding with whom to contract. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said an aspect of the case that has bothered him was the court's decision to re-examine the 1976 precedent on the court's own motion _ that is, after neither of the parties brought up the issue. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said he sees the court as currently divided into three groups: _ The liberals, Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ The conservatives, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, and apparently _ The moderates, himself and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> The division, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said, means that all three moderates must align themselves with the two liberals on any given issue to take control of the court. That the conservatives will control the court in some areas, he said, is almost a foregone conclusion since some of the moderates are conservative in areas. He said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, for example, almost always lines up with the conservatives in criminal cases, giving the conservatives their five-member majority. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> noted it is difficult to classify <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> yet, because he participated in only a few of the court's weekly conferences. There will be a much clearer picture of the alignment next summer, after the term concludes, he said. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, perhaps best known for his 1973 decision in the case of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, which overturned restrictive anti-abortion laws in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, also warned that the court could reverse that decision during the coming term. He indicated the ruling could turn on how faithful <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is to the judicial doctrine of `` stare decisis,'' a policy of courts not to disturb a settled point of law. `` The next question is, ` <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> go down the drain?''' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` I think there's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term. You can count the votes.'' Commenting on <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>'s remarks, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, accused the justice of interjecting himself in the presidential campaign. `` Apparently <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> recognizes that <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> can not survive merely on its constitutional merits, so he is calling for cavalry support,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Dukakis Campaigning Against Bush Liability, Not
Veep</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> relishes running against <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` Is there anybody here today,'' he recently asked a shirt-sleeve rally in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, `` is there any citizn in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, who thinks <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be the nation's drug czar?'' Loud cheers and hoots from the partisan crowd. A week later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to deliver an address on his view of U.S.-Soviet relations, the kind of speech aides were quick to describe as `` major.'' Early on, he questioned <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment with this example: `` If he truly believes that <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, how can we trust his judgment when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future is on the line. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aides make no secret they are convinced <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, is a major liability to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee. Certainly, polls show that most voters think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, is far more qualified to succeed to the presidency than <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But those same polls also show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gaining, not losing, ground since he picked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. That phenomenon can be explained by a number of factors unrelated to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The big early <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead was illusory, based as it was on polls taken before voters were giving a moment's thought to the two candidates. More important was how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dealt with his perceived setback in his campaign to capture the White House. His first reaction was to heat up his rhetoric. But the target was more often Quayle than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But as tempting a target as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> might be, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacks him, the Democratic presidential nominee is in the position of spending a lot of time running against the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. It's the political equivalent of kicking a small dog. The dog gets all the sympathy even when he sinks his teeth into the kicker's ankle. When <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> kicks <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, that's a fair fight. Or when other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators take jabs at their <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleague that too is effective. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has as great a dilemma and fewer options on the other principal target of his stump speeches _ <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Twice now _ in 1980 and 1984 _ the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> took their best shots at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The total score was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> 93 states, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> 7. When the 1988 campaign started, the big question was how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s impeccably loyal vice president, could separate himself from the president. How could the vice president establish his own identity while refusing to express the slightest disagreement with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies? The question was asked and asked again. Who was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>? What did he stand for? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed it was a problem, but said he thought he'd overcome it. With a carefully staged convention and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s full cooperation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did just that. He emerged from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> with a new public image. As his strategists had hoped, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suddenly was perceived as the Republican presidential nominee, no longer as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> problem may now have shifted. It's possible that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is now the candidate having trouble separating himself from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. When the Democratic nominee wants to attack the record of the past seven and a half years, he is doing what Democrats had hoped they would never again have to endure _ he is campaigning against <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. There is no easy way out of that dilemma. To win, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> must convince voters that it's time for a substantive change whether they agreed or not with the policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. That's not an easy case to make when most economic statistics are favorable and the outgoing president remains very popular. Twenty-eight years ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. But the country had just been through a recession and the U-2 incident had led to a sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may pull it off. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> are not his best targets.

<TEXT>
 A pocketful of coupons paid off for 81-year-old <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trentel </PERSON>, who says the wad helped slow a bullet and saved his life from an accidental shooting. `` Thank God I had them in there,'' <PERSON> Trentel </PERSON> said. `` The bullet actually tore a hole through some of them. They were so thick they must have made the bullet lose speed, because the bullet hit, then went sideways across my chest.'' <PERSON> Trentel </PERSON> was shot Friday when a 36-year-old woman dropped her purse, causing the weapon to discharge, said police Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pestak </PERSON>. The woman told police she carried the gun after being threatened by her estranged husband. The woman ran from the restaurant after discarding the gun in the trash, but later surrendered to police. `` I heard a loud explosion that sounded like a cannon going off,'' <PERSON> Trentel </PERSON> said. `` But I did n't know I was hit until I reached under my jacket and found blood. I did n't feel anything. The security guard came up to me and said ` You've been shot.''' Trentel, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said the bullet burrowed across his chest, creating a 5-inch welt. The bullet was removed at <ORGANIZATION> Meridia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Euclid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Trentel </PERSON> was released after the treatment. `` It happened so suddenly it was freaky,'' <PERSON> Trentel </PERSON> said. `` I did n't feel any burning. They pulled the bullet out with tweezers. I just have a small hole where they took the bullet out.''

 Thousands of residents returned home Tuesday as state fire officials, helped by nearly 24 hours of favorable weather, lifted evacuation notices and reopened major highways where a raging timber fire destroyed almost 100 homes. `` As far as I know, we have allowed everyone who wants to return home to do so,'' state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said. At least 97 homes and 60 other buildings were destroyed, and 4,000 to 5,000 other structures had been threatened by the fast-moving, wind-fanned blaze northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In less than 72 hours it blackened more than 52 square miles of brush and timber north and west of <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in a half-moon arc 12 miles long and two to five miles wide. The fire had been whipped by gusts of 30 mph and above since Sunday, but on Tuesday, winds were moderate, temperatures were about 10 degrees lower and the humidity level nearly double, <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said. `` If it holds through the night, we'll consider releasing some people tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON>, planning chief for the 2,788-member firefighting force. `` We're looking forward to another inversion layer Wednesday. The temperatures should be moderate.'' An estimated 8,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in several communities. <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said no additional homes were threatened as of Tuesday evening. But homes inside the fire lines could be threatened if winds shift or pick up significantly, he added. By nightfall Tuesday, firefighters had bulldozed lines around more than 35 percent of the 90-mile perimeter of the blaze. The area where it spread thickest on Tuesday _ grasslands in the deserted eastern sector of <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> _ also burned out the quickest. The fire was stopped more than four miles from the edge of the main part of the base, home for some of the nation's most sophisticated spy planes, firefighters said. `` It's all out. It's history. There are no problems there,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> operations chief. Federal fire officials have called this the worst forest fire season in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 30 years, especially considering the fires in and around Yellowstone National Park. The fires have charred 939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park since June. Firefighters there on Tuesday took advantage of a cold spell to make some headway against the blazes before potentially menacing warmer weather sets in. At one point Tuesday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a wall of flames up to 50 feet high surrounded three sides of the forested <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> industrial complex, where sophisticated television graphics are produced for networks and major stations worldwide. About 100 people living nearby were temporarily evacuated but were allowed to return to their homes before nightfall. The complex was unharmed. That complex, which employs 1,000 people, has been cited as one of the leading examples of communications and other high technology industries which have located in rural areas. <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s drought conditions, which accentuated the volume of highly combustible forest materials, plus unusually high wind and low humidity, had combined to create an especially dangerous and unpredictable condition. Only seven firefighters were treated at hospitals for minor burns. No residents were reported injured. The blaze, dubbed the `` 49er Fire'' because it began along winding Highway 49, apparently was started by a transient igniting toilet paper. Firefighters also battled several other fires in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, including a 9,000-acre blaze near <LOCATION> Healdsburg </LOCATION>, about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which destroyed three homes, several outbuildings and briefly threatened a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> geothermal generating plant. It was 75 percent contained.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mocked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the governor of `` Taxachusetts' on Tuesday and told business executives his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival would pay for federal programs by reaching `` right for the wallet'' and taking their money. In a separate appearance in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> farm country, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might oppose selling U.S.-subsidized wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those Democrats, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and who knows who else,'' the Republican presidential nominee declared. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign has said that improved trade with the Soviets should be linked with progress on human rights. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered a breakfast address on economics to the Executives Club in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and then flew to <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, for a rally on the state Capitol steps. On a hot sunny day, a noontime crowd of thousands of people gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an enthusiastic welcome. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also had his supporters _ his name was spelled out in large red letters across seven windows on the Capitol's top floor. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where he attended a $ 1,000 a person fund-raiser whose audience included <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> celebrities <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>. `` On the issue of peace, my opponent's views are simply beyond the pale,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He does not, I believe, see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as the leader of the West and it has not, I believe, occurred to him that if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't lead the free countries of the world, the free countries of the world will not have a leader.'' Taken together, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> command 82 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the businessmen, `` The surest way to kill the recovery is to raise taxes. That will stifle everything from investment and personal savings to consumer spending. It will clamp down on growth. `` It will invite a recession,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised anew that he would not raise taxes, that he would fight trade protectionism and that he would attack the budget deficit with a `` flexible freeze'' on government spending. He did not spell out which programs would be cut and which would get more money, except to say that <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> and interest payments would be exempt from the freeze. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan for a federally funded, regional job-creation and economic development program, which the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor calls a fund to rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` All you need to do is to make a small down payment, $ 500 million, to get those industrial planning technocrats to work in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` My opponent calls this kind of government ` the helping hand.' `` Well, where is the helping hand reaching? Right for the wallet,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, slapping his hand on his back pocket. `` What will pay for that helping hand? Your money. And who is being helped? Not you. It's government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> picking the winners and losers.'' He asked, `` What kind of lasting jobs are going to be produced by this partnership? Only the kind that endure on the public payroll.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state as `` Taxachusetts,'' prompting mild laughter in the audience. He reiterated his proposal to cut the capital gains tax to 15 percent from the current level of 28 percent. `` I'm being attacked, saying this is a tax cut favoring the rich,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Not so. I believe we should cut the capital gains tax again, not to help the rich as my opponent speciously claims, but to create more jobs for everybody in this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The audience applauded loudly. Crediting the Reagan-Bush administration with cutting inflation and interest rates and producing nearly 18 million new jobs, the vice president said, `` Americans can feel and touch and bank upon the prosperity brought by the longest running peacetime economic expansion in our history.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also emphasized economic issues in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, saying the average American family is paying $ 2,200 less in federal income taxes `` than it would have under the Carter-Mondale-Dukakis rate. We are going to keep those tax rates down.'' The vice president listed differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on abortion, gun control, school prayer and other issues. `` I do n't believe that we want to turn far to the left in this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Let's keep it going the way we've been going, in the right direction, without going back and turning things around.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is raising the specter of a Democratic-imposed grain embargo as he seeks to emphasize an economic policy chasm between himself and presidential opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In a pair of campaign stops Tuesday in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told supporters he wants to expand American markets abroad, saying, `` American farmers and ranchers can compete with anyone anywhere in the world if the rules are fair.'' The Democrats, he contended, are interested only in production controls and want to `` control the lives of the farmers.'' Harking back to the grain embargo imposed by President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I will not use food as a foreign policy weapon.'' He cited a July 27 article in the Journal of Commerce that said a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide suggested the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor might re-examine the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of selling government subsidized wheat to the Soviets. `` Can you imagine another president who would leave open the door of using agriculture products to make political points and using our producers in that way,'' he said. `` I will not go back to this grain embargo. Listen, farmers are still trying to recover from that.'' Today <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was courting the ethnic vote in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ with Hispanic events in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> and a tour of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> _ following his day of barnstorming in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Tuesday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was feted at a gala fund-raiser for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Victory'88'' fund, hosted by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. `` On the issue of peace, my opponent's views are simply beyond the pale,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the audience. `` He does not, I believe, see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as the leader of the West and it has not, I believe, occurred to him that if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't lead the free countries of the world, the free countries of the world will not have a leader.'' The $ 1,000 a person event drew a host of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> celebrities, including <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzeneggar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been clearly annoyed at allegations that forced the resignation of seven members of an ethnic coalition and of his choice to run the campaign activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he neither asked the eight to stay nor encouraged their departure. In a brief conversation with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Two </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to say whether he would offer a spot to one of them, <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` I have a lot of confidence in <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, I do n't think he has one bigoted bone in his body,'' was all he would say when asked about <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s future should <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> win the election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had named <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> to a top position at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> stepped down when it was revealed that he had carried out orders from then-President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to compile a list of Jews among the top officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. As to the reports of alleged anti-Semitic and fascist ties by members of his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` I do n't like the allegations about people and I do n't like it being injected into the campaign.'' Asked why he did not urge them to stay in light of that viewpoint, he told the reporters: `` Because then you'd be talking about this all the time, all the time for the next two months, obscuring these other questions we're talking about _ defense, economic policy _ that's why.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comments before his plane lifted off for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> trip. At a colorful rally at the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> state capitol, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to give farmers expanded foreign markets. `` Agricultural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can compete any place in the world so long as we give them access to other people's markets,'' he said. He painted a rosy economic picture under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, promised to `` strengthen and broaden our economic growth,'' and said `` the family right in the middle is earning $ 4,000 more a year than he would have under those tired Democratic policies.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday also announced a team of agricultural campaign advisers, including Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON>

 Republican state Sen. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> beat former party chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. King in a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary Tuesday for a chance to succeed retiring Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> won his first bid for public office, defeating former Gov. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> in a four-way Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary. `` I am very honored to be chosen as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> said after becoming the only woman nominated to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a major party in 1988. `` I believe there are major differences between me and <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>,'' she said. `` I am an average member of an average <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> family. I understand the concerns of the people out there.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the millionaire owner of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> franchise, easily defeated <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, who lost a bid for re-election in 1986, as well as former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> and Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said voters wanted `` a qualified non-politician with real business-world experience and they said they want a senator who'll be independent of special interests. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, who criticized <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s extensive use of television ads during the campaign, said, `` I do n't think <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would mind if I say he got the most votes but I got the best votes.'' With 3,195 of 3,450 precincts, or 93 percent, reporting, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had 244,085 votes, or 47 percent; <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> had 199,112 or 38 percent; <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> had 54,475, or 10 percent; <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> had 20,221, or 4 percent; and tire dealer <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hou-Seye </PERSON> had 5,139, or 1 percent. In Republican voting, with 3,195 of 3,450 precincts, or 93 percent reporting, <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> had 192,485 votes, or 57 percent; King had 136,110, or 40 percent; and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who withdrew from the race, had 8,638, or 3 percent. `` It was a family spat,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in calling upon supporters to back <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> in November. `` We're only going to elect one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> this fall and that senator has to be <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>,'' he said. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> won the nomination for a fourth term from the 5th District. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this year he was vacating the seat to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race and re-entered the House race in June when <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> announced his candidacy. With 226 of 262 precincts, or 86 percent, reporting, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> had 40,633 votes, or 58 percent; <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, former state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman, had 16,805 votes, or 24 percent; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, former director of an anti-poverty agency in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, had 4,664 votes, or 7 percent; former state lawmaker and perennial candidate <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Blenski </PERSON> had 440 votes, or 1 percent. Two candidates dropped out of the race when <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> re-entered, but remained on the ballot. <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> had 4,664 votes, or 7 percent, and former county circuit Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> had 2,127 votes, or 3 percent. The district has been a stronghold for the Democrats, but Republicans have tried to mount a legitimate threat. With all 262 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnhill </PERSON>, a black businesswoman, won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination with 13,513 votes, or 68 percent; environmental activist <PERSON> Janette </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> had 6,341 votes, or 32 percent.

 The scramble for Democratic nomination for the seat held for 31 years by <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, 72, was triggered by his surprise announcement last year that he would not seek re-election. `` I'd be 79 before the end of my next term,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> explained to disappointed Democrats. Ironically, campaign spending became a major issue among Democratic contenders for the right to succeed <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, a gregarious hand-shaker whose low-budget re-election campaigns and congressional budget-cutting efforts in won widespread popularity. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, 53, a former chain store owner who was making his first bid for public office, outspent his three opponents combined _ more than $ 2 million to approximately $ 431,000 by <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, $ 360,000 by <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> and $ 15,500 by <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION>, as of Aug. 24, <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> records showed. `` Politics should be people, ideas and leadership, not multi-million-dollar TV hype,'' said <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, who said his low-budget campaigns more closely resembled those by the indefatigible <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>. When he easily won re-election six years ago, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> spent $ 145.10, he said, some of it for postage to return contributions. Like the 52-year-old <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, 48, sought to bounce back from a 1986 defeat. Although an underdog, <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> former executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Footbal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, came close to upsetting Republican Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> two years ago. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, 48, a three-term secretary of state and former state senator from <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, lost a 1978 bid for lieutenant governor. In the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race, <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 47, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and one-time chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, sought to pin a liberal tag on <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, 36, a veteran of 11 years the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s minority leader. King once served as an aide to then-U.S. Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> before the Watergate scandal unfolded in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. He stressed his opposition to a tax increase and abortion and his support for the death penalty. Engleiter, who said she had the backing of a far broader segment of the party, stressed she had spent much of her legislative career fighting against increased taxes.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not exactly a stand-up comic, but with some punchy one-liners the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee is getting his licks in against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions on defense. Until recently, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s message was obscured by questions about his own military posture and it was no laughing matter for his campaign. But aides were delighted Tuesday at the attention <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got when he delivered some wicked lines that ridiculed the Democratic presidential nominee and provoked the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp into saying that the young <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was merely acting his age. Nearly a month ago, with his vice presidential campaign only hours old, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was mired in questions about whether his hawkish image jibed with another image of him as a draft dodger. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket's attack man, portraying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on defense and inexperienced in foreign policy matters. `` Want to hear a sad story about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told supporters in a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> suburb. `` The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he lost his top naval adviser last week. His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, as the audience roared. Later, in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joked that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's experience in foreign policy was limited to dealing with the governor of neighboring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The jokes got newspaper ink and even some time on the network news. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign was pleased. `` People are now seeing an articulate, humorous individual who has used his time in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be an expert on defense, foreign policy and national security issues,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman. Campaign strategists have long touted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s defense expertise as one of his assets. He has been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for eight years and has been deeply involved in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> issues, among others. But getting that message out has been difficult. A speech last week in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for example, was supposed to be a major display of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s `` stuff,'' as <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> put it. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> tossed out the text, preferring to speak from notecards and ended up making a confusing statement about offensive and defensive weapons and evoking novelist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON> on anti-satellite testing. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s opposition to legislation to make the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a Cabinet-level department also became a distracting issue. Some saw the vote as anti-veteran. That, together with allegations he pulled strings to get into the National Guard during the Vietnam War dogged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> almost from the moment he left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. A hawkish conservative in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> denied using his wealthy family's influence 20 years ago to avoid combat, and indignantly defended as honorable and patriotic his Guard service. Throughout the first weeks of his campaign, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> found himself repeating, `` No rules were broken'' to reporters who questioned him at almost every stop. That has not happened for some time, although <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also has not held a news conference since Sept. 1. Aides say they believe he may have succeeded in finally getting the debate focused on the issues, not his past. `` It's a continuation of our strategy that now is starting to get a lot more attention because all the diversions basically have blown away,'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said. The strategy is to portray <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` dangerously naive'' on defense matters, blasting his opposition to the MX and Midgetman weapons. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Tuesday described the Democratic nominee as `` the most anti-defense candidate on a national level since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>.'' He said it was `` shocking'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had found it necessary to receive defense briefings over the weekend from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't learn what you need to know about the national security of our nation in one weekend cram course,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He was cheered by the heartily supportive audiences on this Midwestern swing. The only discordant note came from a group of disgruntled veterans at a rally in Grand Junction, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. For them, at least, the veterans were still an issue `` What about veterans benefits?'' one asked as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made his way shaking hands. Replied <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` I'm for them.''

<HEAD>Judge Approves Most of $8.75 Million Copper-7 Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge approved nearly all of an $ 8.75 million jury award to a woman whose lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the manufacturer's Copper-7 intrauterine device left her sterile. However, in his ruling Tuesday U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> lowered the award to <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> for emotional distress from $ 1 million to $ 400,000, based on state law limiting such awards to the lower figure. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> upheld a $ 7 million punitive damage award and a $ 750,000 damage award for pain and suffering. In its verdict Friday, the jury found that the Copper-7 was not properly tested, that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> failed to warn about risks connected with the birth-control device and that the company intentionally misrepresented the IUD. The jury found that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> was not negligent in designing or manufacturing the Copper-7. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> plans to submit motions Oct. 4 that the verdict be set aside and for a new trial `` based on evidentiary and other errors,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> already said it will appeal the verdict <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s attorneys, said the judge's action was `` largely pro forma. `` It certainly is one more step toward, we hope, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> recognizing the seriousness of the problem,'' <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON> said. `` We hope someone in that company or <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company -RRB- will hear the clear message that the jury and the court has given.'' <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON> said last week that the verdict marked the first time a jury awarded punitive damages against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> for a Copper-7-related illness and that it was the largest award. About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most widely used IUD in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it was withdrawn from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in January 1986. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> won 14 of the previous 17 cases to be decided. Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, had sought $ 15 million in punitive damages, $ 1.5 million to $ 2 million in compensatory damages and $ 300,000 in compensatory damages for her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>. The jury declined to award him any money.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> requested that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> allow a team of specialists to investigate claims by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and others that <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> used poison gas to crush a Kurdish rebellion. Also Tuesday, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is using such chemical weapons against the Kurds. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conclusions were based on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> examination of Kurdish refugees inside <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and on `` other evidence which to me seems to be compelling.'' `` I feel our evidence is quite convincing,'' he said. `` But we're not in a position to make that public.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> conveyed the request of 10 governments for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumaida </PERSON>, on Tuesday, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON>. The nations making the request are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, she said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied it used gas against the minority Kurds but has previously acknowledged using chemical weapons against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in their nearly 8-year-old war that led to a cease-fire last month. The 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol bans use of chemical or biological weapons, although their manufacture and stockpiling is allowed as a deterrent against attack. Also Tuesday, a high-ranking <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official acknowledged his government is moving many Kurds from small villages for security reasons or to provide better services, but he said it is not trying to wipe them out or change their way of life. Kurdish rebel groups and others have denounced <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s policy of demolishing small villages and relocating their population. But the official, <PERSON> Nizar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdoon </PERSON>, deputy foreign secretary and former <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said in an interview that the government has no intention `` to change the life of the Kurds.'' Asked about reports of widespread relocations, he said: `` If you're talking about the border area, the reasons are mainly security reasons, so that -LRB- rebel -RRB- infiltration stops. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> grants its 2.5 million to 3 million Kurdish inhabitants, who live mainly in the north, a form of regional autonomy, including their own assembly and use of the Kurdish language. Rebel groups demand wider autonomy or creation of an independent state. An additional 6 million Kurds live in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. About 60,000 Kurds, many suffering chemical injuries, recently fled <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and said they did so because of chemical attacks. The Kurds claim <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used the chemical weapons as part of an offensive against the Kurds. An investigating team would need <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s permission to enter the country, and failure to cooperate could hurt its international standing. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it toughened its stand Monday partly because of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> evidence of Iraqi chemical attacks on the Kurds. The evidence led the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to vote for tough economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also suggested the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> relocation of Kurdish population was connected with `` genocide'' against the Kurdish people. The measure still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 Suspected Sikh militants opened fire on a crowd of laborers at a grain market in the northern Indian state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, killing at least 20 people and wounding 60, police said today. <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Virdhi </PERSON>, senior superintendent of police for the <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION> district, said 10 or 12 militants with cloth masks on their faces entered the main grain market in <LOCATION> Sirhind </LOCATION> town late Tuesday, turned off the power supply and then began firing indiscriminately. Sirhind is a medieval town 119 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Seventeen people died on the scene and three died later in hospitals, <PERSON> Virdhi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Of those killed, 14 were Hindus, four were Sikhs and two Christians, he said. Of the injured, 20 were in serious condition in hospitals, <PERSON> Virdhi </PERSON> said. said. Seven women and five children were among others injured. The victims were mostly laborers from the eastern state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> who were working late into the night loading grain. Laborers come from throughout <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to work in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> because they can receive higher wages in the state, the most fertile and agriculturally productive in the country. After shooting for nearly 15 minutes into the crowd with Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles, the attackers left on motorcycles and motor scooters, <PERSON> Virdhi </PERSON> said. Sikh militants have been agitating for a separate homeland since 1982, claiming discrimination by the majority Hindu community which forms more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population. The killings Tuesday raised the death toll in this year's bloody Sikh campaign to 1,920. Most of the victims have been civilians, more than half of them moderate Sikhs who oppose the campaign for a Sikh homeland. Sikhs form less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population of 800 million, but they are in a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to recess their stalled peace talks and resume them in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator, but <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> balked at a proposed meeting date this month. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator said he hoped to come up with a meeting date today. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> proposed the temporary move to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the hope of unblocking the U.N.-mediated negotiations which opened in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> almost three weeks ago. The agreement to pick up talks `` shortly'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was announced Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, appointed by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> last week to oversee the talks in his absence. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief invited the foreign ministers of the two nations to meet at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sept. 22, but the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegation announced that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> could not be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before the first week of October. The Iraqis also said they agreed to attend one meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> only if, before leaving <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, a firm date was fixed for returning. The Iraqis' hardline stance was spelled out in a press statement Tuesday night. <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> sought to play down the problem, calling the question of dates a `` technical, secondary issue.'' He told journalists it could be solved in a `` smooth, undramatic manner'' and indicated he hoped this could be done by today. `` The main thing is the acceptance -LRB- by both sides -RRB- of a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> shortly ... and of the subsequent continuation of the talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>,'' he said. He told a news conference earlier that both sides `` seem committed to keep the peace process going.'' He said they also pledged to continue to observe the cease-fire, which went into effect Aug. 20 after eight years of fighting and an estimated 1 million dead. The Swedish diplomat acknowledged, however, that on `` issues of substance, there has been little, if any, progress.'' But he said the essential thing was that the `` peace process is kept alive.'' The talks have bogged down over differing priorities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants the negotiations to stick to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, starting with withdrawal of all troops to internationally recognized borders. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holds that these borders were delineated in a 1975 treaty between the two countries. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> renounced the accord in 1980 shortly before invading <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the unilateral repudiation violates international law. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants the talks to focus immediately on clearing the Shatt-al-Arab waterway of silt and sunken wreckage. The waterway provides <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with its main outlet to the sea. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also wants immediately to discuss freedom of navigation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says these are secondary issues that could be dealt with after the cease-fire resolution is put into full effect.

<TEXT>
 A drifter found dead 1 -LCB- weeks ago following an argument with his girlfriend over a bottle of vodka was haunted by his role in the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, relatives say. `` He actually was a casualty of the war,'' said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>, estranged wife of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>. `` He had such problems from what was wrong in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Nothing was ever right for him.'' `` He was just a weak person,'' she said. `` I'm sure it was because of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and because of what he had to endure there. But he was a gentle man and a very good person when he was not under the influence.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>, 39, was shot to death Sept. 3 beneath the <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. His girlfriend, <PERSON> Kathlynn </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>, 36, who took his last name even though he never divorced <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>, has been charged with criminal homicide and is being held without bail at the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. A coroner's inquest is scheduled for Thursday. Army Spec. 4 T'Souvas, then 19 and a high school dropout in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, was a member of one of three platoons that entered the village of My <LOCATION> Lai </LOCATION> on March 16, 1968, where, he told an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hearing in 1970, he saw about 30 bodies, `` old men, women and children.'' `` On the way out, <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> saw two small children lying in the road with their intestines hanging out,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <PERSON> Mauna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` In an emotional reaction, he took his M-16 and killed both to put them out of their misery.'' The Army charged T'Souvas with premeditated murder of two unidentified Vietnamese with a machine gun. He was one of nine enlisted men charged in the massacre, in which more than 100 civilians were killed. After two soldiers were acquitted at courts-martial, charges against <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> and the six others were dropped. All were given honorable discharges. Army Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> was convicted of killing at least 22 civilians at My Lai. President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> reduced <PERSON> Calley </PERSON>'s life prison sentence to 20 years. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> served three years under house arrest at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, Ga. He was released when his conviction was overturned by a federal district judge, and he was not returned to house arrest when an appeals court reinstated the conviction. While awaiting trial at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> lived in an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hippie commune, where he met his wife, according to family members.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> was in a tight battle with two backers of former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in early returns Tuesday from a primary election that the ousted governor vowed would be a `` revolutionary step at the ballot box.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumaker </PERSON> were virtually deadlocked with 26 of 58 precincts reporting. A fourth candidate, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, trailed with 14 percent. `` If I lose tonight it's <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> that did it,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` But I do n't think it'll happen. I think I'll win all right; it might not be an easy one.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who predicted Monday that <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> would lose either the primary or general election, said Tuesday night, `` I think we'll be in for some surprises probably before the night is over. When it's over there will be quite a number of changes; nobody will get everything they want. In other returns, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> was running ahead of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, an ultra-conservative <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backer. But some other senators who voted to oust <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> were running behind. `` I think this is going to be the demise of the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> gang myself,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who represents a district in southeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, had predicted Monday. `` But I would n't bet any money on it because I've been surprised once before by the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> folks.'' <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> said Monday he was optimistic but added, `` At times I get very depressed. I'm just resigned to whatever fate they -LRB- the voters -RRB- produce.'' The <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters were banking on voter dissatisfaction over the former governor's April 4 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment conviction and an election-year tax hike approved by the GOP-dominated Legislature to meet a massive budget deficit. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> predicted Friday that <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> would be defeated and said, `` I think we'll see a bigger change than we've ever seen before ... I think that is a revolutionary step at the ballot box.'' One pro-Mecham candidate was his former press secretary, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON>, who ran against former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON> in north-central <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON> said he did not know what a `` Mechamite'' was, adding that he represented new ideas and that <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON> was a `` good old boy'' of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> politics. Early returns showed <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON> with a 2-1 lead over <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, a rural lawmaker who voted to oust <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, was running ahead of pro-Mecham challenger <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mac-Noye </PERSON>. GOP Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, who also voted to convict the former governor, also had early leads. But Sen. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, both of whom voted to oust the governor, were running behind their rivals in early returns. Also on Tuesday's ballot were two congressional races. In District 1 in eastern <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> defeated rival <PERSON> Thane </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON> for the right to challenge first-term Republican <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> in November. With 325 of 417 precincts, or 78 percent, reporting, <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> had 16,163 votes, or 76 percent, to Read's 4,971 votes, or 24 percent. In southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s District 5, two-term incumbent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> easily defeated his challengers. With 68 of 360 precincts reporting, or 19 percent, <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> had 6,591 votes, or 78 percent, to political newcomer <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s 1,017 votes, or 12 percent; <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> appointee for state liquor superintendent whose controversial nomination was withdrawn, had 831 votes, or 10 percent

 Republican Rep. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he would depict his Democratic opponent for governor, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON>, as a free-spending liberal in the fall campaign beginning today after <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s victory in a three-way primary. `` We will show the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> what deep philosophical differences there are ... a choice between fiscal restraint and liberal spending,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON>, a lawyer who ran a fairly close race for governor two years ago, responded that the fight `` is going to be to show the real <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> for who he is, as someone who has been voting against our interests in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the last eight years and comes back and wants us to elect a name to the seat.

Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said late Tuesday at least six people were killed and an estimated 60,000 were left homeless in `` the worst natural disaster in the modern history of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said a team of about 30 doctors and health-care workers were ready to head to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> once clearance was given from officials in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, where workers tried to reopen the capital's two airports and restore electrical and phone service She added that at least $ 20,000 has been collected by the center and several radio stations serving south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s estimated 150,000 Jamaicans. `` We will be willing to supply them with whatever they need,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON>, who is heading the medical team. `` Everyone just wants to know about their families back in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>,'' said relief organizer <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooah </PERSON>. `` There are many very anxious people.'' Three Air <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> planes full of supplies were ready to fly from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> once an airport there was confirmed to be safe, said <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishop Denounces Killings, Government Says It Regrets
Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military rulers expressed regret over the killing of nine parishioners and fires that burned down two Roman Catholic churches, but two opposition leaders blamed the government for the violence. Also Tuesday, the church's <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION> reported a militiaman was acquitted in a November 1985 slaying which fueled public outrage that led to the eventual ouster of dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. A bishop meanwhile demanded justice for victims of the church attacks. `` In the name of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, we say stop this destruction. We condemn ... these criminal acts ... and demand justice for all the victims,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON>, auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, said on Radio Soleil Tuesday night. In other violence, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said a group of unidentified men in civilian clothes attacked Radio Cacique, pillaging and carrying away its broadcasting equipment Tuesday afternoon. Radio Cacique often broadcasts opinion. A statement from Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s military regime was broadcast by radio stations Tuesday, saying the government `` regrets the incidents ... in which the churches of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> and Immaculate Conception were burned.'' Thugs armed with handguns and machetes attacked the congregation of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday during a Mass and burned down the building. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said three more bodies were discovered Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> church, bringing the casualty toll to nine dead and 77 wounded. The church's priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, is an outspoken critic of the military government and popular among <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s poor. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> went into hiding right after the attack. Soldiers and police at a compound across the street from the church watched the assault without intervening. On Monday, the Chapel of Immaculate Conception in the capital's Cite Soleil slum burned to the ground Five men and a woman appeared on government television Monday boasting they had participated in Sunday's killings and warning there would be `` heaps of corpses'' at future Masses. The six made no attempt to hide their identities and spoke on the government-controlled network apparently without fear of arrest or reprisals. They said they supported a rival priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Volel </PERSON> of the Chapel of Immaculate Conception, but <PERSON> Volel </PERSON> denied such a link on Tele-Haiti Tuesday night. `` The police -LRB- are -RRB- pursuing the culprits, among whom are the self-proclaimed perpetrators who appeared on television,'' said the government communique issued by the information ministry Tuesday. The statement said the military government condemned the attacks, would open an investigation and `` sympathizes with the families of the victims, the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> fathers and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' Both churches are led by priests of the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fathers </ORGANIZATION>, a group specializing in vocational training. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government has issued similar statements in the past following mass killings and other violence. But it has never followed up with investigations or convictions. `` We are confronted by state banditry,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Honorat </PERSON>, head of the Haitian Center for the Defense of Human Liberties. <PERSON> Honorat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most popular opposition leaders, blamed the government for the killing. Several witnesses on the scene of the attack against <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s church say they recognized city hall employees among the assailants, but Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> denied the charges <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> mayor until <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s ouster on Feb. 7, 1986, returned to that office in army-run elections in January, and remained after <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a coup on June 19, ending four months of civilian rule. A criminal court in <LOCATION> Gonaives </LOCATION> meanwhile acquitted Cereste Saint-Phard because of insufficient evidence after three of six witnesses failed to appear at his trial, Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Saint-Phard </PERSON> is an ex-member of the feared <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, a private militia of terror that kept the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family in power for 29 years. He was charged with the shooting death of <PERSON> Jean-Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cius </PERSON>, one of three high school students killed by Macoutes during an anti-government demonstration.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> overcame a conservative challenge in the Republican primary to become the frontrunner in the general election race for retiring GOP Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>'s seat. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> easily defeated political newcomer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>, who called himself the real Republican in the race, in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> will face former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> in the November election. Polls have given <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> a big lead over <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, despite <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> conservatives' complaints over <PERSON> Jefford </PERSON>'s lack of support for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In 1981, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> was the sole House Republican to vote against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax-cut package; In 1987, he had the second-highest anti-Reagan voting record among Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as analyzed by <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> Quarterly magazine. He opposed the president on 71 percent of the key votes. With 259 of 262 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> had 30,135 votes, or 61 percent, to <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>' 19,163 votes, or 39 percent. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> and his people ran a very energetic campaign. I commend them for this energy. I'm confident we can all work together and win as a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> told a packed hall of supporters Tuesday night. Former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> easily won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary to run for <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s lone <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, which <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> is vacating. Four Democrats sought their party's nomination, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> were locked in a close race with 99 percent of the precincts counted early today. <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> claimed victory, but <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> refused to concede. The major party winners will be joined on the November ballot by <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a socialist who is running a strong independent campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, and candidates representing the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Small Is Beautiful Party.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has capitalized on the Pledge of Allegiance and national defense as presidential campaign issues, scoring enough points to pull ahead of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in two public opinion polls. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suffered his highest negative rating of the race in one of the surveys released Tuesday, while in the other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favored by sizable margins on the issues he has been pressing most strongly in the race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by eight points, 47 percent to 39 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and 49 percent to 41 percent in a Gallup poll. Two polls Monday had it closer, but two surveys last week also put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead and found underlying movement toward him. A <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times nationwide poll released today showed a dead heat, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both receiving 47 percent support among the most likely voters. Among all registered voters who were surveyed by the newspaper, 54 percent identified <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate who would best ensure a strong defense. In the Gallup poll, 68 percent had heard of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a law requiring teachers to lead classes in the Pledge, and nearly half of them viewed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> less favorably because of it. The rest split between rating him higher and saying it made no difference. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, has said he acted on the basis of a court opinion that the law was unconstitutional. But in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll 70 percent said teachers should be required to lead the pledge, and half of them said they felt that way even if the requirement were unconstitutional. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also did well on defense: Twenty-eight percent said he would make the nation stronger while only 4 percent said weaker. By contrast, 39 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defenses weaker, and just 13 percent said stronger. The rest in both cases said defenses would remain unchanged. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even out-polled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on competence, an issue the Democrat had sought to make his own. Fifty-one percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be more competent at managing the federal government, while 32 percent chose <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The CBS-Times poll also found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ranked nearly even with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on protecting the environment, an issue that traditionally goes to the Democrats but that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been stressing recently. Forty percent in the Gallup poll viewed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> unfavorably overall, up from 32 percent last month and the highest all year for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the poll. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated favorably by 53 percent, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won both ratings, with 59 percent favorable and 35 percent unfavorable. Both candidates' confidence ratings declined in the CBS-Times poll. Fifty-nine percent said they would be uneasy with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in an international crisis, up from 53 percent last month. Forty-seven percent said they would be uneasy with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, up 10 points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored worse than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on helping the middle class, losing that rating 33-47. And Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> did poorly as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate: Just 32 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to be president, while 58 percent said they would worry about him stepping in if it were necessary. The CBS-Times poll was conducted among 1,043 probable voters from Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup poll was done Friday through Sunday among 1,003 registered voters and was given a 4-point margin of error. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll was conducted among 1,105 registered voters from Friday through Sunday and included 656 voters described as most likely to vote. The margin of error was 4 percentage points.

</TEXT>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The place was pretty hard hit from the look of things from the air. Coming over the western part of the island, you could see the trees were down, almost like dominoes. It was like a tornado went ripping through there. Before we landed, they let two people hang with harnesses out of the plane to get pictures of the island. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> people and the foreign relief people said they were going to use the footage to show how bad the island was really hit. We finally landed, and there were probably about 12 or 15 policemen and soldiers and some other people there to help out the fire department. There was debris thrown up against the buildings and strewn everywhere _ ventilation ducts, baggage carts. A couple of big hangars had their roofs bent back. The terminal was flooded. There seemed to be a lot of flooding in the streets still. It was still raining when we were there. Nobody was mentioning any casualties, but they were saying things like, `` If you think this is bad, you should see the rest of island.'' It was getting dark when we left. You could n't see any lights. The island was totally dark, and so was the airport. There are no landing lights at all. It looks very strange at night. The people seemed really happy to see the fire department. They really need a lot there. There's no water, electricty or phones right now, and no one's really sure when they will be restored. Before we left, one woman was pleading with us not to make it look so bad because of the tourist industry. We took back two teen-age boys to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. They both seemed pretty excited about going through a hurricane.

 The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen, while stock prices rose slightly in cautious trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, traders said. The dollar closed at 133.45 yen, up 0.38 yen from Tuesday's closing After opening at 133.47 yen, the currency fluctuated throughout the day, ranging between 133.33 yen and 133.65 yen. `` The dollar-yen rate did not move much due to two different perceptions about the dollar's future,'' said <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamazaki </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` But dollar-selling sentiment continued to prevail in the market as participants waited cautiously for the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figure,'' <PERSON> Yamazaki </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for July are scheduled to be announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later today. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues ended trading at 27,805.67, up 11.51 points or 0.04 percent from Tuesday's closing.

Despite a wait-and-see mood due to the upcoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures and a Japanese holiday Thursday, volume on the first section reached the 1 billion share level for the first time since Aug. 19, traders said.

<HEAD>ABC Poll: Legalization Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nine of 10 Americans reject decriminalizing all illicit drugs, with a majority saying legalization would lead to increased drug use, according to an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll. In addition, 70 percent of those polled said they want the federal government to increase spending to prevent drug abuse. The legalization of marijuana was favored by 25 percent of those polled, but only 7 percent favored the legalization of cocaine and 6 percent said heroin should be legal. The nationwide telephone poll of 509 adults conducted from Aug. 30 through Sept. 1 showed that 51 percent believed legalizing drugs would lead to increased drug use. Eleven percent said use would decrease and 38 percent said it would make no difference. Asked whether all illicit drugs should be legalized, 9 percent said yes and 90 percent no. The margin of error for the poll, released Tuesday, was plus or minus 5 percentage points. By a 2-to-1 margin, 47 percent to 23 percent, those polled said legalization would lead to an increase in crime, not a decrease as some have argued. Twenty-nine percent said it would have no effect. Majorities also rejected the arguments that legalization would drive organized crime out of the drug business -LRB- 64 percent -RRB- and that it would make drugs less dangerous to users -LRB- 55 percent -RRB-. Asked which drug causes the most problems in society, those polled said: cocaine, 28 percent; alcohol, 25 percent; crack, 25 percent; heroin, 6 percent, marijuana, 4 percent; and LSD, 1 percent. Twenty percent of those polled said drugs were the most important problem facing the country, compared with 6 percent who listed it No. 1 in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll in October 1987. In the poll released Tuesday, unemployment, the budget deficit, poverty and international affairs each were listed by 7 percent as the most important problem facing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will sharply limit its loans of giant pandas for foreign exhibit in an effort to halt commercial exploitation of the rare animals, a <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said today. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile reported that all loans of pandas and snub-nosed monkeys to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were being suspended `` so as to protect the endangered species.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the only country where pandas live in the wild, estimates that fewer than 1,000 remain, threatened by poachers and deforestation. However, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yushan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which has charge of conservation, said the new policy affects all countries, not just the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and does not completely rule out future loans. `` It's not that pandas absolutely ca n't go,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` It's just that such exhibits should be controlled.'' <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said if a foreign leader requests a panda loan, top Chinese leaders may agree to enhance bilateral ties. However, he declined to say under what other conditions pandas might be released for exhibit abroad. `` We believe the fewer the better, and no exhibits at all would be best,'' he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been sending about four pairs of pandas abroad each year, with foreign zoos competing fiercely for the animals. Other officials contacted at the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> also refused to spell out what the new policy would mean in practice or how it would affect any such loans already approved. Regardless of how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will implement the new policy, its effect on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zoos is moot. In June, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> suspended its issuance of import licenses for pandas, scuttling planned exhibits in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State Fair. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had approved both loans. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency said it wanted to consider objections by American conservation groups that the loans exploit pandas for profit and interrupt efforts to breed them in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> stopped giving gift pandas to foreign zoos in the 1970s but requests for loans of pandas for temporary exhibits abroad have multiplied in recent years. Six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zoos as well as zoos in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have received separate pairs of loan pandas. Many more have asked, using banquet diplomacy and high-ranking connections in an effort to win Chinese approval. Zoos receiving loan pandas generally pay <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> $ 300,000 to $ 500,000 but often take in much more than that in increased ticket sales, prompting both the Chinese and the foreign zoos to accuse each other of profiteering from the pandas. `` Foreign zoos often make a lot of money,'' <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said. `` We're not saying they should n't make money, but there should be some other reason for the exhibit.

 Republican Sen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> and Democratic challenger <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> claimed their parties' nominations in primaries that apparently set a record for voter disinterest `` It's real disappointing,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Growe </PERSON>. The 292,000-voter turnout was about 10 percent of the state's 3.1 million eligible voters _ apparently the lowest since the state began keepinr records in 1950. <PERSON> Growe </PERSON> blamed the lack of voter participation on the absence of serious challenges to either <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> or <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, whose races topped the ticket. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> spent Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was in session, and voted by absentee ballot in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. With 99 percent of the state's 4,079 precincts, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, 54, who was first elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, received 93 of the vote in the Independent-Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary with a 110,052 tally <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 49, of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, came in a distant second, with 5,426 votes or 5 percent. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeleniak </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, a retired physicist, was in third place, with 2,388 votes or 2 percent. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, 46, son of the former vice president and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, received 155,156 votes, or 91 percent, in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary. His challenger, truck driver <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herschbach </PERSON>, 41, a supporter of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, received 15,927 votes, or 9 percent. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, a former state senator and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s attorney general since 1983, said his primary victory, `` lets us go forward directly again tomorrow.'' `` I expect polling to go up and down a little more, and it's going to close in very soon and it's going to be a horse race, and I'm going to win,'' he said `` I like winning elections.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has trailed <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> by up to 19 percentage points in public opinion polls, although no independent polls have been released recently. He also has trailed <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> by a 2-1 margin in fund-raising. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> expects to spend $ 6.5 million in his re-election bid, while the <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> campaign plans to spend $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million.

 <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> paved the way for the creation of an independent Palestinian state when he severed ties with the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` We are at a crucial stage,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, the key to peace, security and development in the Arab region ... is in the offing.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is likely to discuss creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in meetings today, the final day of a two-day visit, with the Greek and French foreign ministers. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief told socialist <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a kind of parliament-in-exile, would decide on a Palestinian state on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The Palestinian council is to meet next month in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. `` The only option left is the right, realistic and irreplaceable one _ namely, the Palestinian option, the essence of which is the independent Palestinian state,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said at a closed-door meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 165-strong Socialist group, the largest in the 518-member assembly. `` This state will have a republican, democratic and multiparty system; it will abide by the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and will not discriminate among its citizens on the basis of color, race or religion,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. A test of his speech was released to reporters. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should represent the Palestinian people at an international peace conference. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected the idea and refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. `` It would be possible at the said conference and through the negotiations which will take place within its framework to discuss and agree -LRB- on -RRB- arrangements for international guarantees of peace among all states of the region, including the independent Palestinian state,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> stated. Of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision July 31 to relinquish sovereignty over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said: `` The measures ended the European, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> debate on Palestinian representation at the international conference. No one can claim anymore that there is someone else to share with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the representation of the Palestinian people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to form a provisional government or a government-in-exile for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians live. The territories, captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, have been the scene of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising since last Dec. 8 in which more than 260 Palestinians and six Israelis have died. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Balfe </PERSON>, a British Laborite who attended the session with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader spoke in Arabic for about 40 minutes, then fielded questions for another half hour. He said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` made it fairly clear that the recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was part of the negotiation'' at an international peace conference. Lord Plumb, the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> president, met for 20 minutes with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> before the meeting. He told reporters his message to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader was `` Get out of violence, get into negotiations,'' and added he sensed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> `` to move toward condemnation of violence.'' But in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s address contained nothing new. `` It sounds like a rehashing of all his -LRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s -RRB- ideas, the main thing being that he still wants the disappearance of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. That's the crux of it ... I do n't see anything new,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>NBC to Interrupt Olympics for Live Presidential Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will carry the first presidential debate live, reversing an earlier decision and taking a potential $ 8 million loss when it interrupts its prime-time coverage of the Summer Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Tuesday the change was made because `` there is no more important news story than selecting the 40th president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> have already said they would carry the Sept. 25 debate live. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had said last week when the date of the first debate between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was announced that it would carry the debate on a tape-delayed basis rather than interrupt the Olympics. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> issued a statement saying <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would interrupt the Olympics for 90 minutes for the debate, then return to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, bring viewers up to date and resume live coverage of the Olympics. `` There is no more important news story than selecting the 40th president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and there is no more important event than staging the 24th Olympiad. What to do? <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has a rare opportunity to provide our viewers both the debate and the Olympics. We shall do just that,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. NBC News President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said the change was `` an $ 8 million question, potential revenue loss of 8 million bucks. We just decided that this was a terrible dilemma, and we would do our best to try and cover both.'' Olympic events that evening will include track and field, cycling, swimming, basketball and boxing.

 <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, one of the thousands who narrowly escaped a wildfire, complained of dizziness, searched for shoes, and cried that the flames that razed her home may have killed her dog. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> and her son were part of what <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker Elzabeth Quirk dubbed `` the morning of tears'' at an evacuation center Tuesday in a Grass Valley high school. `` The fire raced in on us. We ran for the car, but it beat us there,'' said <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, 51, a resident of the tiny community of Rough and Ready, three miles west of <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. She paused, weeping, then added, `` I could n't get my dog in the car. She was too scared.'' Her son, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Griep </PERSON>, 29, had stopped in during a bicycle tour of the nation that started from his home in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The bicycle burned in the fire. `` I rode out in a firefighter's jeep, we got separated from my mom's car, and the fire swept right over us,'' he said. More than 1,200 fire refugees have passed through the center since flames erupted Sunday, said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>. About 70 spent the night on cots in a gymnasium Monday, he said. Uncounted others slept in vehicles outside, at the homes of friends or relatives and in motels that were filled up to 30 miles away. The estimated 8,000 evacuees have been able to return home, if they found their homes still standing, authorities said. Nearly 100 houses were gutted. Other residents returned home only to be chased a second or third time by the erratic, stubborn blaze in the drought-parched hills of timber, oak and brush. Among the evacuees were <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vierra </PERSON>, in their early 30s, who lived in the open bed of their pickup truck with three young children. `` Of course it's hard, but at least I know where my kids are, where my husband is,'' she said, waving her hand at her family. A 40-foot section of wall at the center was plastered with hundreds of messages, like `` Call if you need a place to stay'' or `` Just want to know you're all OK, could n't get through on the phone.'' Most just pleaded, `` Please call!'' Nearby were piles of donated clothes and food. A children's activity area was decorated with their drawings Nurses at the medical station treated everything from scrapes to headaches. Air tankers dropping fire retardant periodically thundered overhead through the smoke, drowning conversation. Occasionally, word came in that another area was safe for residents. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Blicht </PERSON>, 56, of Rough and Ready, got that word and immediately jumped in his recreational vehicle. `` We're headed back to see if the house is still there,'' he said. `` I was hosing down the roof to put out cinders when we had to leave. We left the chickens and everything.'' Some of those who lost homes had insurance, those without may have to depend on government and private aid. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, who had no insurance on her destroyed home, was asked about the future. `` I have no idea,'' she said. `` I just do n't know.''

He vowed the same result against <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON> on Nov. 8, although polls show the incumbent, a landslide winner in three previous elections, with a comfortable lead over both the Democratic contenders. <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>, 64, remained confident of his re-election prospects as a self-described `` top fiscal conservative in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I think I can win the election without much trouble,'' he said in an interview from his home. `` But I'm still going to work hard.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman is telling <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to `` do your homework'' before pushing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve the opening of an underground nuclear waste disposal facility. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., made the statement Tuesday after his Government Operations environment, energy and natural resources subcommittee was told that major questions remain about the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant -LRB- WIPP -RRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> The department wants to begin putting waste into the underground facility next month, but it has not adequately proven that it can operate it safely, according to witnesses and documents at the hearing. Among those raising questions were the department's office of safety appraisals, its <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and an environmental consultant it hired to review WIPP. At the same time, the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it would be premature for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request to pass legislation needed to launch the $ 700 million project. `` There are many uncertainties involving WIPP performance that must be addressed before <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> can demonstrate that the facility is suitable,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> called the hearing to look into the department's plan to place 125,000 barrels of so-called transuranic waste into the repository 2,150 feet below the ground near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>. Transuranic waste, a byproduct of nuclear weapons production, is a combination of radioactive material and a wide variety of hazardous substances. The waste proposed for WIPP represents approximately half the amount now stored above ground in about half a dozen states. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said energy officials should `` go home and do your homework and then come back and ask us for the legislation. Do n't put the cart before the horse We're one month away from this targeted -LRB- waste -RRB- loading and you ca n't justify this loading.'' <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, deputy assistant energy secretary for nuclear materials, told <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> the agency plans to follow environmental laws governing the disposal of dangerous waste during a five-year test of the WIPP facility. `` WIPP will not endanger the safety and health of the public,'' she testified. A department spokesman said in an interview Tuesday night that the repository is ready to begin receiving waste perhaps by the beginning the year, but for four obstacles in the way. He said no date has been set, however. `` We wo n't have an opening date until we have the resolution of those four items. I think it's too strong to say the opening has been postponed indefinitely. We're actively pursuing the opening of WIPP,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>. He said nuclear waste containers must be tested, a five-year plan for use of the facility and a site readiness review must be performed before an opening date can be set. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must also pass a bill withdrawing the <ORGANIZATION> WIPP </ORGANIZATION> land from public and mining uses. But in a memo written Sept. 2, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of safety appraisals, said the department's final safety analysis report lacks `` sufficient information for us to independently conclude that the facility can be operated safely.'' In an August letter to <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> team that visited <ORGANIZATION> WIPP </ORGANIZATION> said facility officials `` have not addressed issues associated with either adequacy of the -LRB- plant's -RRB- design or the quality assurance of the construction phase.'' <PERSON> Lokesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON>, the consultant, said energy officials had not given him any data about what might happen to stored waste if the facility was breached by a pressurized brine reservoir that appears to exist about 800 feet below portions of the WIPP site. <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a staff member of the office of safety appraisals, also questioned the need to even put barrels of waste into WIPP during the five-year test. `` The DOE describes WIPP as a research and development facility, but we have not been able to receive a final plan of research requiring waste emplacement,'' <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said that because waste barrels are not expected to leak during the five years, `` actual repository conditions are not being evaluated and actual repository performance will not be demonstrated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON> said he has been unable to resolve questions about whether <ORGANIZATION> WIPP </ORGANIZATION> officials would be able to retrieve waste that leaked from barrels and where any retrieved waste would be stored.

 In a primary that could be called `` <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s revenge,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and five other Republican incumbents who voted for the ex-governor's impeachment were defeated in the first primary since his ouster <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> was beaten Tuesday by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> in what some had viewed as a David-and-Goliath race. House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a Republican who started the impeachment process against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> last fall, lost to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumaker </PERSON>. Two candidates were picked in each House race. `` If I lose tonight it's <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> that did it, but I do n't think it'll happen,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said earlier. `` I think we'll be in for some surprises probably before the night's over,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told reporters as the results rolled in. `` When it's over there will be quite a number of changes. Nobody will get everything they want.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> had predicted Monday that the primary would be `` the demise of the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> gang. ... But I would n't bet any money on it because I've been surprised once before by the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> folks.'' House Majority Whip <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> _ all Republicans who voted to impeach or convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> _ were renominated. But Republican Sen. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> lost to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, as did Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Both incumbents voted to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. Reps. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hungerford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauch </PERSON>, who voted for impeachment, were defeated. Rep. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>, who cast her vote for impeachment, was apparently renominated, but a recount was expected. Sen. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, one of the former governor's strongest supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, narrowly defeated challenger <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON> Some key <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers lost their bids for the Legislature. His former press secretary, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON>, was trounced by former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON> in north-central <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member who was named by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to head the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, lost his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bid, and Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporter, lost his north <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> seat. The <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters were banking on voter dissatisfaction over the former governor's April 4 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment conviction and an election-year tax hike approved by the GOP-dominated Legislature. Two lopsided congressional races completed Tuesday's ballot. In District 1 in eastern <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> overwhelmed <PERSON> Thane </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON> for the right to challenge first-term Republican <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> in November.

<HEAD>Two Consultants Sue Morton Thiokol over Challenger Explosion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two safety consultants sued <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, claiming they were fired for attempting to inform <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> about problems involving solid-fuel rocket motors after the destruction of space shuttle Challenger. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Laine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> filed separate suits Monday in federal court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> seeking unspecified damages. The suits allege wrongful termination, defamation and violation of federal racketeering laws. Both men were hired as system-safety analysts for the booster redesign program created after the January 1986 explosion that killed Challenger's seven astronauts. The accident was blamed on a faulty seal in a booster rocket. <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, 45, worked at the rocket maker's plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> from November 1986 until March 1987. <PERSON> Laine </PERSON> started in January 1987 and was fired the following month. <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>'s suit alleges he wrote 221 catastrophic `` hazard analyses,'' or ways that the rockets could fail, that <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> failed to forward to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> to build shuttle rockets. <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>'s litigation asserts he was defamed when <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> falsely told another prospective employer, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, that he was fired because he got into a serious fight with one of his supervisors at <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Laine </PERSON> contends he was ordered to cease an investigation of a potential hazard in the booster rocket engine and had been told that safety engineers were only to `` cut and paste old reports'' and not investigate any new potential safety problems. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> falsely told <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Laine </PERSON> was fired for compiling `` classified information'' that he should not have had, thus defaming him, the lawsuit indicates. The suits also assert that racketeering laws were violated when <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> used the mails and telephones to file false reports with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regarding its contractual obligations with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, whose corporate offices are in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, was named as a defendant along with five of the company's Utah-based managers and Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an engineering personnel company through which <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laine </PERSON> were paid. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said Tuesday he would have no comment because he had not seen the complaints. Lawsuits filed by another former engineer, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, who warned against the launching of the Challenger, were dismissed last month by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 As Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s record-breaking fury sends <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islanders scrambling for cover, National Hurricane Center Director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON> remained calm at his helm. The barometric pressure at the storm's center plummeted to 26.13 inches at 5:58 p.m. EDT Tuesday night, making <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> in terms of barometric pressure, but Sheets handled a mob of reporters with ease. `` I've flown into 200 hurricanes. ... I really do n't think this is difficult,'' he said. With his schedule of interviews timed to the minute, Sheets spent most of Tuesday on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> in full color sprawled across much of the western <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Rosy-cheeked and good-natured, Sheets was named acting director during the 1987 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season and became director in March. The transition from former director <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, widely known for his distinctive style and flat-top haircut, to Sheets, his dark blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a gray wool-blend jacket, has been smooth. `` He knows his job very well and he's a calm personality,'' <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>, the center's budget analyst, said of Sheets. On days with especially active tropical weather, Ms. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> steps in to coordinate media interviews. Interest in <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> has been high since it started packing hurricane-force winds last weekend and by Tuesday night became a Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph. A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength has the potential for causing catastrophic damage with winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure below 27.17 inches. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> has been compared to the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which slammed into the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> and killed 408 people, and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> coast in 1969, killing 256 _ the only other Category 5 storms to hit land this century. The last major hurricane to make landfall was <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> in 1985, along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. The major television networks, local stations and print media were on hand to monitor the hurricane. The center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricane forecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch on the hurricane in a large, open roomful of blue monitors flickering with graphics. And while Sheets might appear to spend most of his day with tiny microphones snaking down his back and fielding media questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts. Dealing with a major hurricane is n't much different from dealing with smaller ones or tropical storms, Sheets said, adding that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> has been particularly `` well-behaved.'' `` It does what we think it's going to do,'' he said. `` You feel a lot more confident about what you're doing than with weaker systems.'' His previous experience with hurricanes has served him well in keeping off the pressure during these sometimes 18-hour days. `` I've done this for 25 years so at one stage you're prepared to do it or not. ... I do n't feel a lot of pressure,'' said Sheets, while eating lunch. Sheets said he remains in touch with his predecessor, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, but did n't get any special advice from his friend on dealing with his high-visibility post at the hurricane center here. What's <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, now a television forecaster for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> station <ORGANIZATION> KHOU-TV </ORGANIZATION>, doing now? `` He's getting geared up in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' said Sheets with a smile.

 A mother and her three sons have been sentenced to life in separate prisons for murdering three police officers during a standoff at a motel. Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> on Tuesday said he wished he could have imposed the death penalty on <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> Easter and her sons, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON>. First-degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life without parole. The death penalty is forbidden under <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s constitution The judge sentenced the four to solitary confinement in separate prisons. `` In this way, the defendants will understand the pain of separation that the victims' families feel,'' he said, his voice breaking in emotion and fading to a whisper. `` The actions on July 9 are a disgrace to the word ` family.' I only wish the victims' families could step forward and sentence the defendants instead of the court.'' Easter and her sons were convicted last month of murdering Inkster Sgt. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and Officers <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> during an 11-hour siege in 1987.

When the four surrendered, the officers were found dead of multiple gunshot wounds. Easter and her sons maintained their innocence Tuesday. `` Our blood is on your hands. You pray for us and our lives,'' she said. `` I am sorry about the loss, but it was n't our fault. Injustice has been made legal,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON> said.

 West German <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, home after 20 months of captivity in the hands of pro-Iranian kidnappers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was flown to an undisclosed location to rest and enjoy a reunion with his wife and two sons. Reporters were given no chance to talk to the 55-year-old <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> businessman upon his arrival at <LOCATION> Cologne-Bonn </LOCATION> airport Tuesday night. West German officials, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, have denied making any payments for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' freedom. He was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers late Monday night. But the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> said `` a sum of millions is believed to have been paid to kidnappers for the release.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> cited unidentified security sources. The newspaper also quoted a source identified only as a `` security expert'' as saying that at least 40 million marks -LRB- $ 22.2 million -RRB- were paid for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' release. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> is known to have good sources within the government. A high-ranking government official described <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' long captivity, the isolation he endured, and his constant uncertainty over his fate. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said today <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> apparently arranged for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> to be transferred from captors linked to <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who is being tried in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for hijacking a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet, to the group that freed the West German. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> apparently arranged the release to regain favor with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a vital trading partner and the Western nation with which it has the closest ties, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, citing unidentified sources. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was abducted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987, three days before a West German engineer, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, was kidnapped. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was freed Sept. 7, 1987. The <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> clan was believed to have abducted both men. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, touched down at 10:20 p.m. aboard a twin-engine West German military jet after a five-hour flight from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The federal minister for chancellery affairs, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, was aboard the same plane. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> later told West German television that <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was `` feeling better than he had expected.'' `` But naturally he's very weak. He's probably feeling better now because of the initial excitement than he will be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,'' the official said. `` He's been flown to a place where he can find privacy for a time. He desperately needs quiet, to recover, to work through the experience. `` I do n't know where he's going and even if I knew I would n't say,'' the official said <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> told him his kidnappers `` treated him humanely, but the conditions were hard, he was always isolated and was always chained.'' <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Neusel </PERSON>, a state secretary in the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at the airport <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> said there were signs he was about to be released before it happened. `` His hopes increased when he was given new clothes three days before he was freed,'' said <PERSON> Neusel </PERSON>, who also was on the plane with <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> could not identify the kidnappers because they wore masks in his presence. The minister, who headed the government's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> crisis staff, reiterated earlier government statements that no deals were made for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' release. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> pharmaceutical company, was freed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at midnight Monday by Shiite Moslem extremists.

<HEAD>School Board President Fired</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The city <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> president has been fired for feeding false information to board members in an effort to track down leaks to the news media. Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> on Tuesday removed <PERSON> Meldon </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>' credibility had been undermined, but asked him to remain a board member because he has `` good ideas.'' <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> was expected to announce today whether he would accept the position. The board president said Tuesday he would resign if the mayor asked. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> called <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>' actions `` a terrible mistake in judgment.'' `` My view is that the public can tolerate an official being wrong on an issue,'' <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said. `` What people generally find intolerable is an official lying to them.'' In tape-recorded remarks Monday to a political club, <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said he leaked false information to board members `` to see if they were lying to me.'' `` I know who's doing the lying,'' he said. `` I know who it is. I feed them the lies, then they run out and lie to the press.'' `` Members of the school board ... tell you they are not reporting things to the press and ... every time you say something to'em, it shows up in the press, only with a spin ... that's far from accurate,'' he said. `` Then I think that you just do what you have to do _ you tell them things just to see how it's reported in the press. Then that way, you can tell who's reporting it to the press.'' <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said Tuesday he gave out three versions of how candidates for school superintendent would be interviewed. `` I felt justified in taking extraordinary measures,'' he said. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said leaks were undermining the selection process, because some candidates threatened to withdraw if their candidacies were made public. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said he had not deliberately misled any board members `` on anything substantial'' and that the story was `` essentially true.'' Board member <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON> said, `` I think there's something wrong with the man. The whole thing is getting uglier and uglier. We are trustees -LRB- with -RRB- the most important responsibility in the city.'' <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>, who took office in December and declared that education would be his first priority, named <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> board president in his first week. The mayor replaced <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 51, a board member since 1979.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who had planned to bypass <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on his tour of the region, landed in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> today after bad weather and mechanical trouble diverted his flight to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, meanwhile, security forces surrounded a bus filled with nuns and schoolgirls that was hijacked by armed guerrillas as it headed for a Mass to be celebrated by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. A nun today said some of the 71 captives had been released but she did not know how many. Official <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said a group of `` fanatics'' had taken over the bus Tuesday. Diplomats said the guerrillas were believed to be members of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The pope was informed of the hijacking, but made no comment. Arriving in <LOCATION> Johnannesburg </LOCATION>, the pope, an outspoken critic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial segregation policies, did not kiss the ground, as he customarily does the first time he visits a country. The pope, who is on a 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, spent three hours at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s Jan Smuts Airport before he and his entourage left for <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> in a convoy of cars and buses. The 270-mile trip to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, a mountain kingdom completely surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, was expected to take at least five hours. Foreign Minister R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> greeted the pope on the steps leading from the plane and accompanied him into a VIP lounge at the airport while security forces stood guard inside and outside the terminal. `` We consider it a privilege to assist the Holy Father,'' said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who ordered 100 luncheons for the entourage. The plane's pilot, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>, told reporters he decided to divert the chartered <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 flight because of a low cloud ceiling and because two radio beacons at the airport in <LOCATION> Masera </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s capital, were out of order. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot said conditions had been unsuitable to bring the plane below the clouds. <PERSON> Masera </PERSON> airport is in a valley between 3,000-4 ,000 - A hard, freezing rain fell on <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. King Moshoeshoe II and other officials waited at the airport for hours before the announcement that the pope would come by road. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> was to be the third stop on a 10-day trip that has taken the pontiff to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. He also plans stops in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops have advised <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> that this was not an appropriate time for him to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The pope has said he would like to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at some point, but the country was not mentioned when the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announced this week that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> on another African tour next year. Hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> had been expected to cross into <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> to see the pope during his scheduled 48-hour visit to the kingdom. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops have been active in the anti-apartheid movement, particularly in the period since 17 major black opposition groups were banned in February. The government has blamed the bishops for the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s decision to omit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from his official itinerary, and pro-government media have claimed many Catholics are angry at their leaders. Pro-government media also tried to depict the pope as having repudiated Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best-known anti-apartheid cleric This interpretation was based on the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s unqualified denunication of political violence and reservations about sanctions and election boycotts. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> advocates sanctions and is urging a boycott of upcoming, segregated municipal elections. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> has repeatedly condemned violence but says he understands how some South African blacks feel they have no other alternative in seeking to end white-minority domination. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs, and its 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, said there are no fundamental differences between the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and the Anglican archbishop, who met earlier this year at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police are switching to semiautomatic handguns, joining other big city police departments trying to match the firepower of drug dealers and other criminals. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> announced Monday that 9mm handguns will replace .38 - caliber revolvers as standard-issue weapons for the `` The bottom line is the average police officer is going to be safer, and feel safer, because of these guns,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>, president of the union that represents <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s 1,400 patrol officers. The 9mm handgun fires more accurately, reloads more quickly and carries more bullets, police said. Semiautomatic weapons were issued two years ago in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police will begin providing them in February, and they are under review in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, were armed this year with 9mm semiautomatic weapons because of a murder rate double that of last year. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> police and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s still use revolvers as their primary weapons. `` We're being outgunned,'' Officer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police said Tuesday about the decision to use <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> semiautomatic guns next year. `` The criminals, the drug dealers have more firepower than the police.'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s police department, the largest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with 1,900 members, joins the 1,200-member <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state police in switching to the 9mm. The 650-member <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is making the switch, and 50 smaller departments in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> already carry the weapon. `` It's the wave,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's gradually becoming as standard as the .38 - caliber revolver once was The switch has been quicker among the nation's smaller police and sheriff's departments, the majority of the nation's 19,000 law enforcement agencies. Smaller departments can make the change more quickly and cheaply. The average 9mm pistol costs about $ 400. The .38 - caliber carries only one shot in each of six chambers, which must be loaded Semiautomatic pistols are loaded by inserting a 12-to 17-round magazine into the handle. `` You're talking the difference of between 12 seconds to reload a .38, under the best of conditions, and 2 seconds for a 9-millimeter,'' said <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials said it could take more than a year to complete the switch. The city must seek bids, select a manufacturer and train officers to use the weapon.

<TEXT>
 The captain of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 does not hold the missing puzzle piece that could explain why the plane crashed, a federal official says. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a member the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> `` does not know why this plane crashed.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, one of 94 survivors from the Aug. 31 crash at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> that killed 14 people, was released from Parkland Memorial on Tuesday after talking to <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators about two hours. The captain was treated for back and facial injuries. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, who briefed the news media by telephone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> seemed to have sharp recollections of much of the flight but could not help explain why the plane lost engine power and crashed. The captain told investigators that the flight from <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> had been uneventful and that everything seemed normal again as he waited on the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> taxiway to leave for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. When the plane took off, everything seemed normal until it climbed into the air, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told investigators. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> heard `` two loud bangs, or explosions'' but no warning beforehand. `` He previously experienced compressor stalls, but nothing like this,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who is on medication but has been taken off morphine, told investigators he went to full power and simply `` tried to keep the airplane in the air.'' One of the last things <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> recalled was that he had failed to pull the plane out of trouble, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. `` He realized they were not going to make it,'' the investigator said. Investigators had hoped <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> might be able to tell them if the plane's flaps had been set correctly, but he could only tell them that he remembered they were approved when the crew went through the preflight checklist, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. `` We're still very concerned about the position of the flaps,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. One inconsistency the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> had been trying to clear up has been that the cockpit recording captured the crew saying the flaps were in position for takeoff, but the wreckage showed the flaps in the wrong position. `` He said he does not remember anything in relation to the flap handle,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said today the government's `` let burn'' forest fire policy, proven inadequate in the face of this summer's extraordinarily dry conditions, will be revised before next year's fire season. To maintain now that the 16-year-old policy is sound `` just does n't make sense,'' he said in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show. `` I am confident that before the next fire season, we'll have a revised policy in place which will take into account these kinds of conditions,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. In a separate interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said the `` let burn'' approach toward naturally occurring forest fires did not work this season `` and to suggest that's a sound policy just as it stands just does n't make sense.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said that since July, when the policy was abandoned, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agreed to treat every blaze in Yellowstone National Park as a wildfire, meaning it would be fought with every resource possible. `` There is n't anybody today who would n't tell me they would have fought every fire from the beginning of the season if they could have foreseen what would happen this year,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. He said fires that have destroyed homes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are coming at the beginning of the fire season there. `` We're there where we were in July or early August in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>,'' he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman said Tuesday that no time should be wasted now arguing over the `` let burn'' policy and that the government's attention will be focused on snuffing out blazes raging in eight states. The comments came after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was briefed at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the fires, which have charred some 4 million acres this summer. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was told that there is no way to predict when the fires will be put out, but that the administration has dedicated `` every resource available'' to doing so, said spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Asked about the harsh criticism that has erupted over the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy of letting naturally occurring fires burn, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> contended it was not the time for such a debate. He noted that the policy had been suspended in July and that any new fires that erupt will be fought for the remainder of this year's fire season. `` It does n't serve anybody to get into discussions about policy disputes,'' he said, adding, `` We're in the middle of a fire situation of serious proportion and we're fighting it with everything at hand.'' Noting that the nation has n't seen such fires in its history, he did acknowledge that the situation calls `` for some review of the policy.'' `` At this point, what's clear is that the fires are out of control. ... There is no need to argue over policy differences until we come up with the next firefighting season next year. Right now, it's all-out, fight-the-fires,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> briefed reporters after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>. Criticism of the government's `` let-burn'' approach to the fires came from a usually strong <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supporter, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, who called the situation `` a catastrophe.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, speaking to reporters after visiting the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We all knew how dry it was and a lot of us were saying, ` Hey, do n't let this burn,' and they could have contained it at that time.'' Referring to the damage done to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said, `` Now you have a million acres lost in one of the most important national park areas in the world. ... It's a catastrophe.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on a political trip for his vice president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declared today that the national economy is strong and `` what we have seen in the last eight years is only the beginning.'' `` We intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right through the'90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the federal government can never again spend and tax the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people into another economic nightmare,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president's remarks were prepared for delivery at a Republican rally at <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> shipping center. He was to speak later in the day to an expected crowd of 1,000 at a $ 250-a-plate <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. In his <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said children born today `` will know the brightest future the world has ever seen.'' `` That bright future is also yours,'' he told his audience. `` It is your birthright as Americans, and what we have seen in the last eight years is only the beginning.'' The national economy has been expanding for more than five years following the steep recession that marked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first two years in office. `` Ultimately, the choice before the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people is the choice between two visions,'' he said. `` It is the choice between the policies of liberalism or the policies of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s political mainstream.'' The president, a former Democrat, said that party's `` liberal leadership ... has turned a once proud party of hope and affirmation into one dominated by strident liberalism and negativism.'' `` The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's memory lane, it starts to look like a ` Nightmare on Elm Street. If you want to remember how things really were just a few years back, think of the year 1979,'' he said. `` In that one year, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> were all lost. That was the year 1979. Do n't we have the right to ask the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people: If the liberals return to power, what happens in 1989?'' Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in advance of the trip that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be giving `` traditional political speeches'' trying to win support for the Republican ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until the Nov. 8 election. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates hoping to benefit from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> events include Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, seeking a second term against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, who is the wife of former Gov. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>, and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, opposed by State Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION> as he seeks his third term. Both <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> enjoy comfortable leads in state public opinion polls. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the state capital, pledged, `` We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those Democrats, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, and who knows who else.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s 11 electoral votes with 51 percent of the popular vote against then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980 and swept the state with 60 percent of the popular vote against <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984. Records showed that the only incumbent president to visit <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardeau </PERSON> previously was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> on Oct. 26, 1902.

In the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> primary, the most prominent casualties were <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON>, beaten by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, and House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a Republican who started the impeachment process against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> last fall. He lost to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumaker </PERSON>. Not all the former governor's supporters were successful _ his press secretary, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON>, was trounced by former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON>. The victor in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary was <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team owner who spent $ 2.1 million, mostly his own money, on a campaign built mainly on TV ads. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, seeking office for the first time, said voters wanted `` a qualified non-politician with real business-world experience and they said they want a senator who'll be independent of special interests.'' But former Gov. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, who finished second in a five-way race, said he hoped there could still be a place for personal campaigning not so reliant on big money. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would mind if I say he got the most votes but I got the best votes,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, who lost the governorship in 1986 after one term. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> will face state Sen. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. King, a conservative former state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, in a reference to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s wealth, said there were `` major differences between me and <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. I am an average member of an average <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> family. I understand the concerns of the people out there.'' King had criticized <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> for seeking the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> when she has two small children at home. That theme also was sounded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, when Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said former state Sen. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> should not seek the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because she has a 22-month-old daughter. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> apologized two days later, but the candidate he backed, former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, won a six-way race. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s GOP gubernatorial primary, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> brushed aside two opponents, then promptly attacked <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON>, vowing to `` show the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> what deep philosophical differences there are ... a choice between fiscal restraint and liberal spending.'' In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> soundly defeated conservative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> after a primary in which his frequent opposition to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies became an issue. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> said <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>' supporters had `` overstated the case, to put it nicely'' in attacking him on issues such as gun control and abortion `` I'm hurt that people would feel so emotional about me that they would want to try to destroy me,'' said <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, whose popularity among Democrats makes him a heavy favorite. Primaries also were held in: _ <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where Democrat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringham </PERSON> edged <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> for the nomination to oppose Republican Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>. _ The <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, where all five <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members up for re-election gained their party's nomination. The council has 13 members. Here are vote totals in the major races: In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, with 93 percent of the vote counted, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had 244,085 votes or 47 percent, to <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>'s 199,112 votes or 38 percent.

<HEAD>IRA Member Made Sudden Movement Before Being Shot, British Soldier
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British soldier said today that he shot an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member because he thought the guerrilla was about to detonate a car bomb. The soldier, one of four <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> soldiers who shot and killed three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members, testified during an inquest into the shootings. He was identified only as ` Soldier A' and was hidden from public view by a curtain for security reasons. The soldier told the inquest he began shooting after `` a sudden aggressive movement'' by <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>. The British military said it believed the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> man was about to carry out a car bombing in this British colony. In an intense cross-examination, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrory </PERSON>, the attorney for the families of the three dead men, accused Soldier A of lying. `` I put it to you that it -LRB- the movement by <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> -RRB- did n't happen You shot him in the back without any movement whatsoever,'' <PERSON> McGrory </PERSON> said. `` There was movement. I'm not blind,'' the soldier responded. `` I thought he was going for a button, a switch to detonate the bomb,'' he said. `` This was my major worry at this stage.'' The testimony of Soldier A came on the seventh day of the inquest by <PERSON> Gibraltar </PERSON> <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzarello </PERSON> and an 11-man jury into the March 6 shooting deaths of <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, by soldiers of the elite anti-terrorist unit. Critics of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government allege the shootings were evidence of an unofficial `` shoot-to-kill'' policy directed against <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members on missions against British targets. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> were members on active service at the time of their deaths. A senior British intelligence officer has testified at the inquest that the special services men believed the three were planning to set off a car bomb during a changing of the guard ceremony set for March 8. Neither a car parked in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, nor another left on the other side of the Spanish frontier contained a bomb. But Spanish police found a third <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> car loaded with 141 pounds of Czech-made explosives and a timing device in the nearby resort city of <LOCATION> Marbella </LOCATION> two days after the shooting. The inquest has no power of prosecution but is to determine whether the SAS soldiers involved in the shootings acted lawfully. If the inquest finds they did not, the soldiers could be criminally charged. The seven men who formed the <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> unit that took part in the operation against the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members have only been identified as `` soldiers A through G'' for fear they could become targets of revenge attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 Attorneys said they would appeal the conviction of seven former or current police officers on charges of taking bribes from bar and restaurant owners to overlook violations and perform special services. `` I think this is a pretty sad day when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can be proud of this kind of prosecution,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said after the verdict Tuesday, which came on the federal jury's sixth day of deliberations. The defendants were convicted of 55 counts, including racketeering and extortion. They were accused of accepting more than $ 18,000 in bribes. `` We take no joy in these verdicts today, but I believe that they will help to strengthen this department in the long term,'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> said. Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> set sentencing for Oct. 11. The officers were convicted of two counts of racketeering, each carrying up to 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. They also were convicted of extortion, which carries the same penalty. `` I just think it's a sad commentary on the jury system and the judicial system,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Traini </PERSON>, who represented Kilroe. Much of the prosecution's case rested on tape recordings made by a nightclub manager in which officers discussed payoffs. During closing arguments, Special Prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Farmer of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the case was `` about misuse of office for personal gain. It's about each one of them using their power as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officers to line their own pockets.'' Defense attorneys argued that the money accepted from business owners was nothing more than Christmas and vacation gifts from people with whom the officers worked closely over several years. The four former officers on trial were <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The attorney for a reputed South American drug lord says he will appeal the man's escape conviction on grounds he was illegally captured in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where his arrest April 5 touched off anti-American riots. A federal jury Tuesday convicted <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, 43, of escaping in 1971 from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> could receive up to five years in prison at sentencing Oct. 27. Defense attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said he will challenge the legality of <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s arrest at his home in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> ruled earlier that <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was wanted for possible involvement in international drug smuggling and that previous court cases allowed the government to seize people outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was wanted for questioning in the 1985 slaying of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. No charges have been filed against <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> in that case. But he is under indictment in three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> narcotics cases and one in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was serving a three-year sentence at Eglin for illegally entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, fraud and misuse of a visa. He was accused of slipping out the back door of a chapel at the unfenced, minimum-security prison during church services. Honduran police captured him in a raid by helicopter. Police and American officials put him on a flight to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, and he was flown from there to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> had been living openly in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> since 1986, when he escaped from a Colombian prison. He had been held on charges involving the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine brought into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> touched off rioting in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> by students, leftists and others that killed several protesters and ended in the burning of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate. Demonstrators contended <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s extradition was barred by the Honduran constitution. Extra security officers were posted for the trial here.

<HEAD>FBI Director Disciplines 6 in CISPES Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said today he is suspending three bureau employees and censuring three others for mishandling a terrorism investigation into political opponents of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policy. `` I am disciplining these individuals ... because of the managerial or supervisory inadequacies displayed by them'' during a bureau investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told a congressional committee. `` The mistakes in judgment that took place during the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation were serious ones, and I can not emphasize too strongly my firm conviction that there is no place for such mistakes in the work of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' Session told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sessions became director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in November. He disciplined the agents for actions taken from March 1983 to June 1985, when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s boss. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> now heads the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Sessions said the six employees work variously at the supervisory, unit chief and section chief levels and that they include personnel from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as well as at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> field offices. Three of the employees, whom he did not name, have been placed on probation and suspended without pay for 14 days. The other three were formally censured, he said, with reprimands being placed in the employees' files that could affect their chances for promotions. The director said a seventh employee, `` whose performance would in all likelihood would have have merited dismissal,'' has resigned. That was an apparent reference to an agent who quit in 1984 after acknowleding he had given classified documents to an informant in the CISPES case. Sessions testified that the investigation was launched in March 1983, based largely on information provided by informer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>. The probe concentrated on the organization's headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, its <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> chapter and on a handful of other <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> chapters. The investigation was prompted by tips that key members of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> were involved in covertly furnishing funds and material to a leftist group seeking to seize power in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> told the bureau in 1984 that <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members were plotting to assassinate President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and disrupt the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials now say <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> supplied them with disinformation and misinformation. He stopped working for the bureau in 1984 and filed suit in 1986 to get some back pay he felt he was owed. `` The major problem came when the scope of the investigation was unnecessarily broadened in October 1983,'' Sessions testified. `` The broadening of the investigation ... in essence directed all field offices to regard each <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> chapter, wherever located, as a proper subject of the investigation.'' Sessions said that, based on the available documentation, `` there was no reason to believe that all CISPES members nationwide knew of or had any involvement in support of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terrorists. Thus, there was no reason to expand the investigation so widely.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director said the decision to broaden the probe unnecessarily `` was made at a comparatively low level and ... supervisory personnel at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters who should have reviewed and analyzed this decision and appreciated its significance failed to do so.'' Sessions said there is no evidence that the White House or any other government agency or outside private group attempted to influence the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe. He said there is no evidence the probe was politically motivated or director or that the conduct by the six <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> employees who are being disciplined was illegal or motivated by any improper purpose. The <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe involved surveillance, undercover attendance at meetings, interviews with organization members and checks of telephone and utility company records and records of license and credit bureaus, as well as law enforcement agency record checks. The probe was closed when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded the group was involved in political activities protected by the First Amendment and not involved in terrorism. Details of the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe became public in February when a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyers' group obtained documents showing that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents photographed protesters at peace rallies, recorded license plate numbers and investigated nuns, union members and college students.

 Palestinians stabbed to death an Arab suspected of collaborating with the Israelis and dumped his pajama-clad body on a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> street today, police and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The death of <PERSON> Adli </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalga </PERSON>, 30, in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, raised to five the number of alleged collaborators killed in the past 10 days after a call from <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders to `` rid ourselves of collaborators.'' Also today, eight Palestinians were wounded in the occupied territories, including a 12-year-old boy shot with a plastic bullet in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops arrived to close the market area where Thalga's body was found, the army said. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops opened fire on a group of young Palestinians who were throwing stones in the marketplace, wounding seven of them, the army said. The army lifted a curfew from the town of <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after maintaining it for eight consecutive days in the largest manhunt for <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists in the uprising. The army said about 200 suspected activists were arrested during the curfew. Telephone lines were cut and residents reported frequent blackouts and water shortages, Israeli radio said. Curfews were in effect today in five <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camps and villages, forcing some 36,000 people to stay indoors. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said masked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> assailants dragged Thalga out of his house at dawn today and fatally stabbed him. Arabs living in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said he was a suspected collaborator. Seven Palestinians accused of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have been killed since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian rebellion in the Israeli-occupied territories. The uprising has claimed the lives of 265 Palestinians and six Israelis. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said today he feared an erosion in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s attitude toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to allow <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to address the group Tuesday `` We ca n't leave the stage open only to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> propaganda,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters at the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> before leaving on a two-day visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A meeting between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace crusader <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> prompted a political storm, with right-wing legislators demanding <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> be tried for treason for meeting with an enemy. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said an investigation would be launched into <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> and called it `` a grave deed and a serious transgression,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> radio station in 1973, presented <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> with a peace plan calling for mutual recognition between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and an end to the Palestinian uprising.

 A homeowner who put up a basketball hoop in his driveway says he wo n't have to tear it down for now, because the city has called a time-out on its ban on backboards. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Meckler </PERSON>, 33, an attorney, threatened to sue after being cited for a hoop, backboard and pole in his driveway.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today conducted its first nuclear test explosion to be monitored by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts. The blast at a long-secret testing ground shook the earth's surface and shattered a window. The explosion in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> had a force of 100-150 kilotons, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, several times more powerful than the bomb that devastated <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, at the end of World War II. The Hagfors Observatory of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Establishment </ORGANIZATION> said it measured the explosion at 50 to 150 kilotons. Buried in a hole more than 2,000 feet deep, the nuclear explosion was felt and heard 2.4 miles away at the forward command post. The ground shook and a low rumble was heard as a reddish cloud of dust rose above the test site and the earth's surface bucked. The blast was not expected to have a noticeable impact at the observation site about 30 miles from the blast but it shattered a window in one building. `` The radiation situation in the region of the test and beyond the boundaries of the test site is normal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported after the blast at 8 a.m. The sparsely populated region is 1,700 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Sophisticated American sensors planted just over 10 yards from the device itself and five seismic sensors each in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were designed to gauge the force of the blast. The verification techniques were expected to lead the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratify two long-pending treaties limiting the size of underground blasts. `` The goal of the experiment is to bring into practice the most effective means of control, in order to use them for verifying the 1974 agreement on limiting underground tests of nuclear weapons and the 1976 agr eement on underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes,'' the Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` However, they did not go into effect because the American side considers the measures of control insufficient,'' it said. The Joint Verification Experiment, which included a similar blast at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> testing range at <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, a month ago, marks a turning point in the two superpowers' nuclear test policies. The top-secret experiments always have been off limits to scientists from the other side, who were forced to rely on data gathered at great distance to determine the force of underground explosions. Both sides accused the other of exceeding agreed-upon limits, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> balked at ratifying the two treaties from the 1970s until it could monitor explosions close up. The Soviets, who have been campaigning for an end to all nuclear testing, agreed earlier this year to go along with on-site measurement. An American team of up to 40 specialists has been working at the test site since April to drill a hole parallel to the Soviet test hole and plant the Cortex hydrodynamic measuring device that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government regards as the most sensitive gauge of a nuclear explosion. <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5A cargo planes ferried drilling rigs and monitoring equipment into the sleepy <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> airport to prepare for today's test. `` No one thought even a year ago that what is about to happen, could happen,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team chief <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told reporters Monday on his arrival to observe the test. He called the experiment `` a real triumph of confidence-building'' for both sides.

 An <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent says he found no legitimate business purpose for a personal 300-foot water slide, two Rolls-Royces and hundreds of thousands of dollars that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and a key aide got through PTL. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON>, an auditor of tax-exempt organizations, was the second witness Tuesday in the trial of the ministry's $ 52 million claim against the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. The trial began Monday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Under cross-examination today, <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> conceded that because of a lack of documentation, he could only assume that a business purpose was lacking and that the expenditures were for personal use. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorneys are seeking to force the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> to repay the money they say was lost through through mismanagement of funds that included cash advances on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit cards and unjustified compensation and benefits. <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> listed among the expenditures with no legitimate business purpose a 300-foot water slide at <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wylie </LOCATION> home, which has since been sold, and $ 32,000 worth of luggage. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> today whether the Rolls-Royces and two Mercedes were solely for the personal use of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>. `` PTL's check paid for them, but the paperwork was inconclusive as to who the owner was,'' <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> said. `` There's no documentation that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> used the cars.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> testified that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> could find no documentation to support the business purpose of about $ 300,000 in cash advances made to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> between 1984 and 1986. `` There was no back-up documentation for any of the cash advances, none of them,'' <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> said. `` We tried to evaluate the business nature of these items, but we could not determine any.'' <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> also testified that records show neither <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> attempted to reimburse the ministry for money taken from three executive accounts. The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry and <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> filed for reorganization in bankruptcy court in June 1987, three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the ministry amid a sex and money scandal involving church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. Earlier Tuesday, a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> accountant said he was frustrated that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other top ministry executives continually ignored his memos warning that the ministry financially was facing `` real emergencies.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who was an accountant and financial director at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> from June 1979 through July 1987, also testified that top executives received bonuses in anticipation of money coming into the ministry's coffers, but that there was often no money in the bank to cover those bonuses. <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is expected to adjourn the trial after this week's testimony. `` We'll probably present our case in a month or so,'' <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said during a break in the hearing The Bakkers and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> stayed away from the hearing again today, just as they have skipped preceding sessions. <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> has said he will call them as witnesses.

<HEAD>University Changes Mind on Commercializing Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, in a reversal, plans to set up companies to help the university make money off professors' discoveries Eight years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> decided against commercial involvement, saying it could compromise the university's commitment to knowledge. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> is trying to get corporations to invest up to $ 35 million that would be used to organize companies around the work of researchers, mostly those at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said today. If the companies were successful, they would be sold, and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> would get 10 percent of the profits. Some academics fear that the profit motive can distort what they see as their main role _ the search for knowledge _ by introducing subtle pressures on researchers to spend their time on projects with commercial potential. Harvard President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> and other university officials said the plan addresses concerns about mixing business and learning. `` There are few things that matter to me more than trying to strike this balance,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. The plan's complicated financial arrangement is designed to allow the university to profit from the work of faculty members without getting directly involved in commercialization, the university said. Researchers who make potentially profitable discoveries would not be required to sign up with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial arm if they preferred to make their own arrangements with private investors. In 1980, the university planned to join <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> biochemist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ptashne </PERSON> in forming a genetic engineering company. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> helped organize the company and find initial investors in return for 15 percent of the company's stock. But <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> pulled <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> out of the arrangement. He said directly investing in commercializing researchers' work `` could confuse the university's central commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and learning.'' Medical School Dean <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosteson </PERSON> said Tuesday that he was trying to find a way to augment the school's $ 350 million research budget, speed development of useful research and more directly profit from arrangements that professors were making on their own with private investors.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said today that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s greeting to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the occasion of the Jewish New Year was nothing but a stunt and should not be taken seriously. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> extended wishes for a peaceful new year in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at a news conference in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where he addressed socialist members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a day earlier. `` To all Israelis and to all Jews, ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>,' ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>''' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, using the Hebrew expression for `` Happy New Year.'' `` When I say ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>,' I mean ... a peaceful new year for all our children, all our peoples, for the whole of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, speaking in Arabic with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activist <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also said he was willing to meet with Israeli government respresentatives at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> this week. He could be prosecuted when he returns for holding such a meeting, which violates a 1986 Israeli law banning contacts with terrorist groups. Israeli officials dismissed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s greeting as a public relations ploy. But pro-PLO Palestinians said it showed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> favored a political solution and was seeking peace. `` Really it's a stunt,'' a foreign ministry official said. `` It's very nice to say ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>' in front of a group of journalists, but it would be more constructive if in his speech yesterday there were some concrete change in policy,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. Addressing Parliament members Tuesday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> repeated his call for the creation of an independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories. He also reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> recognize Palestinian rights to self-determination. A spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s gesture would not change the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to holding talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` We will not be misled by the lip service of Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and seeming gestures like wishing ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>' to our people,'' the spokesman, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. `` We know him very well and we continue in our policy to seek peace but not to have contacts with Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his organization,'' he said. `` With God's help we shall overcome all our enemies.'' Israeli leftist <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Avnery </PERSON>, who has met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> 10 times since 1982, said the Hebrew greeting showed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> sincerely sought negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It is obvious that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is ready to talk to Israelis. Now he is speaking in a friendly tone towards Israelis and Jews,'' <PERSON> Avnery </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They say new sounds make new music, so now there ... are new sounds -LRB- of Hebrew -RRB- in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Avnery </PERSON>, who first met <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during the Israeli invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Khazmo </PERSON>, the pro-PLO publisher of the Palestinian weekly <PERSON> Al-Bayader </PERSON> <PERSON> Assiyasi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s gesture showed he was abandoning aggression in favor of a political solution in the occupied territories. `` This means the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is putting aside the military option. It means the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is willing to knock on the door of peace,'' <PERSON> Khazmo </PERSON> said. As sign of how little credence Israeli officials placed on the greeting, one government spokesman said: `` You can tell <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> that this <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official jokingly returns his wishes for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.''

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said today that he and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were for a strong defense based on practical weapons and not the `` Buck Rogers'' dreams of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admnistration. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, stumping in his home state where polls show the Democrats slightly behind, said both he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> know `` the first duty of any president is to defend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against all enemies.'' In a speech at the site of a collection of World War II airplanes, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Democrats supported the Stealth and B-1 bombers, the cruise missile and other new weapons, including research and development of strategic defenses. `` But ... we are living in the real world _ not some science fiction movie,'' he said. `` And in the real world, real wars are still fought with real tanks and guns and fighter planes.'' `` Under this administration, <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has been promoted and our conventional forces have been neglected,'' allowing the Soviets to gain in those areas, he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> where he toured a collection of World War II military aircraft. He donned a leather flight jacket, climbed aboard one of the planes and the engine was started up. However, he did n't fly any of them. The former B-24 bomber pilot says he stopped flying after he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1970. Besides, the collection does not include any B-24s. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to travel this afternoon to an <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> defense plant near <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for another speech. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s appearances on the defense issue were part of an overall focus on the topic this week by the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign. Especially in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is seen as needing to convince voters he would have a strong defense policy. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee, has been painting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal whose opposition to many new weapons systems, such as the MX and Midgetman missiles, would amount to unilateral disarmament of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to travel this afternoon to an <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> defense plant near <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for another speech. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s appearances on the defense issue were part of an overall focus on the topic this week by the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign.

<TEXT>
 A Swedish researcher who has implanted human fetal tissue into the brains of two patients with Parkinson's disease told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> committee today it would be unethical not to use such experimental treatment Dr. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, professor of neurobiology at <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, was among experts asked to appear before the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> panel considering what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government policy should be on such research which the White House proposes to ban. One of the questions the 21-member panel of outside experts was asked to consider was whether animal studies have progressed enough to warrant using the procedure on humans. `` The animal data ... are so promising we have approached a point where I believe it is unethical not to do this in human studies,'' replied <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>. He said his human studies involve two patients who received fetal brain cell transplants eight months ago after suffering from the disease for 15 years and not responding to other treatment. He described both as extreme cases, severely handicappped and out of control. He made no dramatic claims, but said: `` There have been no adverse effects. It appears that we are seeing minor positive changes in the patients.'' He said the transplanted cells have not had time to fully mature and expressed optimism that the patients, both women in their 50s, will continue to improve. The panel was concentrating on scientific issues today and will turn to moral and ethical considerations Thursday before drafting its recommendations on Friday. A proposed executive order from the White House _ not intended for public disclosure _ would prohibit experimentation with fetal tissue. Some members of the advisory panel, which includes doctors, researchers, lawyers and medical ethicists, were offended that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had proposed a position on the issue before the committee had a chance to meet. <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> appointed the committee on the instructions of Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary for health. The issue surfaced last April when <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> sought clearance for experiments in which brain cells from a fetus would be transplanted into patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> denied permission, saying new questions raised by such research warranted careful review. Researchers are hopeful the new techniques will prove useful in treating Parkinson's and a variety of other diseases such as Alzheimer's and juvenile diabetes. However, the treatment involves use of fresh brain cells, virtually requiring that they be obtained from planned, induced abortions rather than natural miscarriages. The moral and ethical questions raised are illustrated by an expressed desire by some women to become pregnant so they can produce an aborted fetus to use in treating relatives. Ethicists also have expressed concern that any guidelines for such procedures would have to deal with the possibility that researchers would pay for abortions in order to obtain tissue. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assistant for policy development, sent <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> a draft executive order accompanied by a memo saying he wanted to rush the proposed federal ban into effect as soon as possible. However, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday that the proposed executive order did not represent official <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> policy and was merely an early draft to get discussion started. `` It shall be the policy of the federal government, to the extent permitted by law, that an unborn or newborn child who has died as a result of an induced abortion shall not be used for purposes of research or transplantation,'' said the draft circulated by <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. Surgeons in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reported last January that they had injected fresh fetal tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two Parkinson's suffers with promising results.

 Firefighters battling Western blazes got a helping hand from weather so cool and wet that a crew was pulled out of the wilderness near <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> National Park for fear they'd be trapped by snow. `` Things are real calm,'' said park spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>. `` We've had some pretty good precipitation.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said today the government's `` let it burn'' forest fire policy will be revised before next year's fire season. To maintain now that the 16-year-old policy is sound `` just does n't make sense,'' he said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` I am confident that before the next fire season, we'll have a revised policy in place which will take into account these kinds of conditions,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. Fires burned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued. Calmer 5-7 mph winds, lower temperatures and higher humidity were a blessing to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Gold Rush country, where a fire has burned 52 square miles since Sunday and destroyed 97 homes and 60 other buildings. Firefighters had surrounded 90 percent of the blaze today. The thousands of residents evacuated Sunday or Monday were allowed to return to their homes. `` Very little happened last night. The fire really laid down. It was even hard to find embers in some regions,'' overnight fire operations chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said today. About 30,000 firefighters battled 32 fires in eight Western states, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received a briefing Tuesday from a Cabinet-level team that toured <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>. As of Tuesday, wildfires had charred 4.1 million acres, an area larger than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates firefighting in the West. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said today that officials have enough resources. `` What we need now is some continued help from the weather,'' he said. `` If we continue to get the weather break, they're actually on the fire line right now directly fighting the fire, which is something they were n't able to do as long as it was so hot, dry and windy,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, clouds that have covered the park since Saturday began to lift today and temperatures reached only 40 degrees, but officials expected a warming trend that would take temperatures to the 70s, said park spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Iobst </PERSON>. `` The fires are still a threat, we are not out of it yet,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>. Firefighters used the break to strengthen lines. Meanwhile, about 550 Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the first of 1,200 sent to reinforce the 7,200 firefighters in the park, arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, Mont. The weather was so cool officials began distributing cold-weather gear donated by residents of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> communities. Few firefighters had been prepared for the cold and wet. Fires have blackened 939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. Blazes in national forests and parks surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> bring the total to 1.4 million acres. In the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> southeast of the park, a 38,507-acre fire was declared contained and a 225,500-acre complex of fires was 85 percent contained with full containment expected by Thursday. North of the park, a 93,000-acre fire that threatened <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and Silver Gate was declared 90 percent contained with complete containment expected by Saturday. A crew was pulled out of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of the park, said fire information officer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>. `` We were afraid if we put a crew in there we might not be able to get them out if it snowed,'' <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. At Glacier National Park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> near the Canadian border, more than 900 firefighters joined by a Canadian `` hot-shot'' crew had a 31,500-acre blaze 30 percent contained. The fire has destroyed 21 homes, killed one firefighter and injured six others. `` They're expecting hot temperatures up there -LRB- in <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> -RRB- today, up into the mid-80s,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahugh </PERSON>. `` They feel there will be increased fire activity because of the higher temperatures.'' Firefighters were to be joined today by 1,400 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers from <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 1,100 firefighters attacked a 247,000-acre fire north of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, crews demobilized from a fire in the far northwest part of the state and rehabilitation work began near <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate north of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Controversy has surrounded the Yellowstone fires because of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy of not fighting most naturally-caused blazes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday that he had not been aware of the policy but that <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> told him it was being rescinded. Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would join him, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> on Thursday to survey fire damage in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and discuss policy.

 Radical students yelling anti-Olympic slogans hurled firebombs today at runners carrying the Olympic torch while riot police battled to disperse the protesters. Police said 16 policemen were injured in the fighting at <ORGANIZATION> Kyungwon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the southern outskirts of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after students hurled about 50 firebombs at the Olympic torch procession. Some of the bombs exploded about 10 yards from the runner carrying the Olympic torch, eyewitnesses said. None of the runners or other escorts of the Olympic flame was hit and the procession did not halt as it passed by the school in a semi-rural area, the witnesses said. Radical students staged peaceful anti-Olympic protests today at several colleges in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Protesters burned the American flag and shouted `` Yankee go home.'' About 200 students took part in a `` Stop the Olympic Torch Rally'' at <LOCATION> Kyungwon </LOCATION> to block the torch as it passed on the road in front of the school. Faculty members tried unsuccessfully to stop the protest. `` Oppose the dictatorial Olympics,'' students yelled. Riot police moved in to block the school's main gate to stop the students from marching out onto the road. But students rushed to the school wall and hurled firebombs at the torch procession, eyewitnesses said. Police then stormed onto the campus and troopers and students battled with their fists, police said. Many of the injured police were hit by firebombs, they said. Police officials would not say if there had been any arrests or if any students had been injured. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Organizing Committee said it was unaware of any attack. The torch with the Olympic flame from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is due to arrive in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Saturday to open the Summer Olympic Games. It was being carried to the western port of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> today when the attack took place. Radical students have staged scattered demonstrations against the Olympics during the past week and battled riot police in clashes at some <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses. The demonstrations have been small and have failed to attract public support. The great majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, including most students, want the Games to be a success. The students are demanding the Olympics be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to promote reunification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. They also contend the Games are cementing authoritarian rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` The Olympics are making the rich people richer, the poor people poorer,'' said a statement today by radical students. The Olympic flame is being carried across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by more than 1,000 torchbearers who each carry it for about half a mile while being escorted by up to 12 other runners. Police and security agents have been guarding the procession. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics because its demand to co-host the Games was turned down. The International Olympic Committee has said the Olympics are awarded only to a single city. The two Koreas are bitter rivals and both claim to be the sole legitimate government on the peninsula. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fears the North may try to disrupt the Olympics. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 42,000 troops based in the South under a mutual defense treaty.

 Thousands returned to their homes as fire officials, heartened by a day of favorable weather, lifted evacuation orders and reopened all major highways where a fire ravaged Gold Rush country. Calmer winds, lower temperatures and higher humidity Tuesday and today helped crews as they bulldozed lines around more than 90 percent of the 3-day-old blaze, which gutted nearly 100 homes and threatened as many as 5,000. `` The fire really laid down. It was even hard to find embers in some regions,'' overnight fire operations chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said today. `` As far as I know, we have allowed everyone who wants to return home to do so,'' state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said Tuesday. But some of the 8,000 residents evacuated had little or nothing to return to in the charred foothills of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, 51, of the tiny community of Rough and Ready was part of a stream of refugees at a high school evacuation center Tuesday, which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirk </PERSON> dubbed `` the morning of tears.'' `` The fire raced in on us. We ran for the car, but it beat us there,'' said <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, weeping. `` I could n't get my dog in the car. She was too scared.'' Her dog's fate was unknown. Preliminary damage estimates were set at about $ 9 million, but authorities expected the figure to climb. Officials also prepared today to begin relieving some of the 2,800 firefighters who have battled the fire, which consumed more than 52 square miles of timber and brush or 33,500 acres since it was started Sunday. `` If it holds through the night, we'll consider releasing some people,'' said <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON>, the planning chief for the firefighting force. Full containment of the fire was expected by Thursday night, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Placchi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The fire, which apparently was started by a transient burning a piece of toilet paper, was one of several blackening <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the drought-parched West, including fires that have charred nearly 1 million acres of Yellowstone National Park. The blaze had been whipped by 30-plus mph gusts through Monday. But on Tuesday, winds were a moderate 5 to 7 mph while temperatures were about 10 degrees lower and the humidity level nearly double, <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said. `` The fire today cooperated quite a bit,'' he said. The one drawback to the weather was an air inversion that forced the grounding of eight aerial tankers, which had dropped more than 2,000 tons of fire retardant on the blaze Sunday and Monday. The swift-moving blaze had threatened 4,000 to 5,000 structures, but only 97 homes and 60 other buildings had burned. <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said no additional homes were threatened as of Tuesday night. But homes in unburned pockets within fire lines could be threatened if winds shifted or pick up, he added. `` There's no nice clear fire line. It's a checkerboard,'' he said. Fire officials reopened state highways 20 between <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION> and 49 north of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Some restrictions, however, remained on secondary roads where mop-up operations continued. Flames Tuesday also scorched grasslands in the deserted eastern sector of <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, home for some of the nation's most sophisticated spy planes. But the fire was stopped more than four miles from the edge of the main part of the base, firefighters said. `` It's all out. It's history. There are no problems there,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a state forestry spokesman. The drought, which increased the amount of tinder-dry grass and <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, created a dangerous and unpredictable condition for firefighters and residents along with the winds and low humidity. But no firefighter suffered a serious injury, <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said. Seven had been treated at hospitals for minor burns and 500 had checked into first aid stations with cuts, scrapes and sprains, he said. There were no reports of injuries among those evacuated, <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said.

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, seeking votes in his pro-defense home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would pursue practical weapons instead of the `` Buck Rogers'' Republican program. `` We live in the real world these days, not some science fiction movie,'' said the former bomber pilot, speaking on a podium amid a collection of World War II combat planes. `` And in the real world, real wars are still fought with real tanks and guns and fighter planes,'' he said. `` Under this administration, <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has been promoted and our conventional forces have been neglected'' while the Soviets have gained in that area, he said. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I are going to devote more defense resources to areas where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is most vulnerable,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> toured the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a private collection, and spoke to an audience including uniformed students from the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, a boarding high school.

<TEXT>
 The Lebanese army today closed the only crossing between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian and Moslem sectors after Shiite Moslem militiamen took to the streets in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for the first time in 17 months. The actions came a day after the country's <ORGANIZATION> Shiite-Moslem </ORGANIZATION> defense minister was briefly held hostage by Christian militiamen forces, heightening tensions between Christians and Moslems deadlocked over the election of a new president. The political wrangling has raised fears that fighting will renew <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war. A statement said army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> issued the order to close the mid-city Museum crossing. Only travelers on their way to or from the airport were exempt. A military source said the militiamen belonging to the Amal organization, headed by Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, took up positions near the crossing and set up a traffic checkpoint. `` The command decided to close the crossing in light of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s suspicious move to avoid jeopardizing the lives of civilians,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity He said Amal's move could result in reciprocal deployment by militias on the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> side and lead to clashes. Amal's deployment in the <LOCATION> Barbir </LOCATION> district was the first by the Syrian-backed militia in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since the Syrians moved in to end three years of militia anarchy in February 1987. Christian militiamen held Defense Minister <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON>, a Shiite, for three hours in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday, police said. The militiamen demanded the release of <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> parliamentarian, who they say is held in the Moslem sector for the past week. But <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON> was released after the army threatened to crack down. <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON> was one of the Christian deputies who boycotted a parliamentary session to elect a new president Aug. 18. Syrian-backed candidate <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, who was president from 1970 to 1976, was the only serious runner and there were not enough legislators for a quorum. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s followers have accused the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> militia, which is sympathetic to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, of forcibly preventing deputies from attending the session to block <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s election. A statement attributed to <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON> said he was to meet the Sunni Moslem acting Prime Minister, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, and hold a news conference in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He did not appear. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, has set Sept. 22 as a new date for the election, one day before the six-year term of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> expires. An unwritten national covenant dating to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943 stipulates the president must be <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the house speaker a Shiite.

 Radical students hurled firebombs Wednesday at runners carrying the Olympic torch, and police said 16 troopers fighting to disperse the protesters were injured. Students at <ORGANIZATION> Kyungwon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the southern outskirts of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> threw about 50 firebombs at the Olympic torch procession. Some of the bombs exploded about 30 feet from the runner carrying the Olympic torch, witnesses said. None of the runners or other escorts of the Olympic flame were hit and the procession continued past the school, which is in a semi-rural area, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Radical students staged peaceful anti-Olympic protests Wednesday at several colleges in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Protesters burned effigies of figures draped with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag or anti-American slogans and shouted, `` Yankee go home!'' `` Get out <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imperialists,'' said a slogan on an effigy at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. About 200 students took part in the `` Stop Olympic Torch Rally'' at <ORGANIZATION> Kyungwon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and faculty tried unsuccessfully to stop the protest. `` Oppose dictatorial Olympics!'' students yelled. The students are demanding the Olympics be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to promote reunification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. They also contend the Games are promoting authoritarian rule. Riot police moved in to block the main gate of the university to stop the students from marching into the street. But the students crowded near a school wall and hurled firebombs at the torch procession, witnesses said. Police stormed onto the campus and troopers and students battled each other with fists, police said. Many of the injured police were hit by firebombs, they said. Police officials would not say if there had been any arrests or if any students had been injured. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Organizing Committee said it was unaware of any attack. The torch with the Olympic flame is being carried across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by more than 1,000 torchbearers who each carry it about half a mile, escorted by up to 12 other runners. Police and security agents guarded the procession. The Olympic flame is to arrive in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Saturday to open the Summer Olympic Games. Radical students have staged scattered demonstrations against the Olympics during the past week and battled riot police at some <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses.

 Residents along the Gulf Coast today stockpiled food and supplies and prepared for mass evacuations as they braced for Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, deemed one of the most dangerous in history. The hurricane, with 175 mph wind, ripped through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and took aim at the resort island of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At least 11 people have been killed and an estimated 60,000 left homeless. Forecasters were reluctant to predict the destination of the storm, called `` extremely dangerous'' by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, but some early guesses ranged from <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast. `` A hurricane is like a gorilla; normally it goes where it really wants to go,'' said <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> TV forecaster <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> residents `` ought to be thinking about what they're going to do in case warnings are posted for their area.'' Asked about the threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Sheets said, `` We're looking at about 48 hours or so, maybe as much as 60 hours, but probably somewhere on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast. There's a little uncertainty exactly where this hurricane's going to go.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON>, state coordinator of the governor's division of emergency management in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said on `` Good Morning America'' that he thought the state had time to prepare. `` We've got our fingers crossed,'' he added. `` Local governments along the coast have been working feverishly for the last 24 hours trying to get ready for this thing, trying to find out where it's going to go,'' <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON> said. For the second time in two weeks, oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Last week, workers were brought inland when Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> washed ashore in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, coordinator for the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> emergency preparedness, said communications systems were being tested and procedures were being reviewed. Based on forecasts from at least four sources, he expected the storm to be in the gulf by Thursday morning. `` That's probably our most critical time,'' he said. `` We'll be making decisions Thursday morning about what to recommend to the citizens.'' In <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said he has already posted special schedules for his officers to follow if a hurricane watch is issued. `` We've contacted all the schools for shelters, to see which ones we'll be using this time,'' said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. `` We're getting all the emergency generators ready for the jails, and getting extra gas for the patrol cars and getting everything set up.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, marketing director for <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, said his company's 18 bases in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region were operating at full capacity evacuating the rigs. He estimated that all the 10,000 or so workers who normally work the gulf would be evacuated by this afternoon. `` I do n't think anybody's going to ride this one out,'' he said. `` We've got to have about a 24-hour cushion to play with this one.'' At the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Nuclear Project near <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, employees secured down loose objects at a reactor under construction. Employees reviewed procedures at the other reactor, which is in operation, said spokesman <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. The plant is 13 miles from the coast and its containment center is built to withstand nature's forces _ including earthquakes and 370 mph winds, he said. `` The plant is probably the safest, most hurricane-proof plant along the Gulf coast,'' he said. At <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON> said the hurricane would not delay the flight of space shuttle Discovery, scheduled for launch later this month from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and major hospitals asked for blood donations. In low-lying southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> today, schools closed early, coastal residents headed inland and workers prepared evacuation centers. Apprehensive residents in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> crowded stores in search of provisions such as batteries and plywood to board up windows. `` I stayed here for -LRB- Hurricane -RRB- <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> because I did n't realize how bad it was going to be,'' said <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` But I vowed I'd never stay again. `` I really think <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> is what has scared almost all of us.'' In 1983, <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> killed 21 people, injured 1,800 and caused an estimated $ 3 billion in damages when it slammed ashore and blasted <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> was a minimal Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength with top winds at 130 mph, compared to the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s Category 5 and 175 mph winds Tuesday. The scale lists such a storm as potentially causing catastrophic damage and having a storm surge of greater than 18 feet. The weather service said Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure. In September 1900, <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> was the scene of the nation's worst natural disaster, when an estimated 6,000 people were killed in a hurricane. Off <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s coast, the only school on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> _ was to close early today and remain closed Thursday and Friday. The town of about 2,000 lies unprotected, connected to the mainland by a two-lane highway. `` We wanted to get the kids out of school before they call an evacuation,'' said school official <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, explaining that buses bringing children home would impede evacuation.

 <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s grandson complained in an article published today that criticism of the late Soviet leader had turned into a smear campaign. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> said his family should not be blamed for the mistakes made by the late Soviet leader. The full-page article in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> was a rare public defense of the man who served as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman and president in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from 1964 until his death in 1982. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the official press carries almost daily articles and letters criticizing <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> for everything from the slump in the economy to his large collection of medals. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, is on trial in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on charges of bribe-taking and abuse of office as a top <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> said the disgrace of his grandfather was hurting him. He is the son of <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. `` I'm 27 years old, and my independent life is only beginning, but I already feel that my surname ever more frequently has become a stumbling block in the most varied situations,'' the younger <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> wrote. `` I am just like everyone, but many do n't want to see anything in me except my surname.'' <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s grandson said he agreed with much of the criticism appearing now in the Soviet press of the former <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, but that relatives should not share the blame. He recalled that under Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, relatives were arrested or shot simply because of their family ties with criminals. `` If you read now about the crimes of the 1930s, we remember the words: ` A son should not answer for his father,' then why do we forget them when speaking about the present day?'' <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> also said some criticism was unjustified because it blamed his grandfather for mistakes made by aides. Legends and rumors arose about <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s family, he said, because `` the private life of our leaders, their family irregularities and problems remain outside the direct attention of society, outside ` glasnost.''' Glasnost, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, has generally not been extended to reporting on the inner workings of the top government and party organizations or the personal lives of leaders. `` First and foremost <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> himself became a victim of the absence of glasnost,'' <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> said. He said his aunt, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>, helped bring down the family name because she was `` uncontrollable'' and did n't respect the law She is married to <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>. In its edition last week, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> published an article by historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> saying that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was revived from `` clinical death'' in 1976. However, the article said the leader was left senile and so weakened that he had difficulty performing simply protocol duties for the last six years of his rule. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> also said that politically, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> `` did n't so much move ahead himself as he was moved ahead by others.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> as a poor speaker and a vain, weak man.

Sept. 9 Las Cruces -LRB- <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun-News on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending: The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> still ca n't seem to get a handle on how much money to spend. It seems that some defense contractors have been hiding information that would bring down prices on weapons purchased by the Pentagon. As a result, the Pentagon has spent millions of dollars more than it needed to for the weapons. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> have had some success halting overpricing. But contractors still are n't complying with a 1962 law requiring contractors to disclose relevant information about contracts. But the contractors are n't entirely to blame. It boils down to a case of mismanagement within the Pentagon. It's always easier to be easy with someone else's money _ in this case ours. Despite the improvements and efforts by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to clean up the contracts, more improvements obviously are needed.

This will mark only the second time in one decade that the number of new arrivals has surpassed 8 million since 1820, when the government began keeping such records.

So far, 16 states have passed legislation designating English as the official language; three other states will have the issue on the ballot in November. We support this effort.

Images created by drug-popping role-model <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> superstars are not the ones most parents want their children to see. The league's moves to stop drug abuse and to show that it has undesirable consequences are laudable ... This is the third year of the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION>'s drug testing program. Teams of first-time offenders are notified by the league's drug office. Second-time offenders draw minimums of 30-day suspensions and third-timers can be banished for life although they can petition for readmission after a year. To players drawing the salaries paid in the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> today, even a 30-day suspension can be expensive. A year can be devastating. But it should be. These overpriced players who so eagerly seek professional help in negotiating their salaries could use a little help in spending them as well. A year back at more mundane earning levels goes a long way toward restoring reality to their lives.

<HEAD>Protesters Demand Interim Government; Strikes Lead To Shortages</HEAD>

 More than 100,000 shouting protesters Wednesday told leaders of the authoritarian government to resign or die and demanded that an interim administration lead <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> back to democracy. The student-led protesters flooded all main <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> streets to reject the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its 26 years of repression and ruinous economic policies. They rejected President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s plan for multiparty elections. `` Step down fascist BSPP government!'' and `` Give us an interim government!'' shouted the demonstrators, who included <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and government employees. `` You run or we will kill you!'' the marchers shouted, thrusting fists in the air. `` If they do n't fall, make them fall!'' they chanted. All shops and offices were closed Wednesday. Crowd estimates ranged from 100,000 to 1 million. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> urged workers to return to their jobs. Many employees nationwide struck Aug. 8 to demand democracy, and food and other commodities have since been in increasingly short supply. Strikes shut down the country's two oil refineries making fuel scarce and forcing the army to use reserve stocks. Foreign embassies have turned to the black market and are paying $ 16 for a gallon of gasoline, sources said. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said the marchers, accompanied by marching bands, included about 100 uniformed policemen and pilots and stewardesses whose pro-democracy strikes have grounded all commercial flights since last week. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, a favorite rallying place, and listened to strident speeches by protest leaders. Diplomats said they had no indication the authorities would yield to demands for an interim government. Demonstrations and pro-democracy strikes also continued in major towns nationwide, including <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bassein </PERSON>, but details were not available. Western diplomats have said protesters have taken control of the administrations of about 40 towns. After weeks of demonstrations, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government announced last weekend that it would end one-party rule and hold the first multiparty elections since 1960 as early as late October. But demonstrations have continued. On Tuesday, opposition leaders told the five-member election commission they would accept no polling organized by the current government. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, former Brigadier General <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and former Defense Minister Tin Oo declared they would not support or participate in government-organized elections and reiterated their demand for an interim government. They also complained that holding the elections in three months or less would be unfair because the opposition would not have time to form parties and raise funds, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> reported. On Monday the three issued their first joint statement, a letter to <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> calling for an interim government. The Western diplomat said the opposition leaders were expected to announce Thursday the names of people they want in the transition government. `` There has not been a groundswell of support for any one opposition leader as there was in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> when people were shouting, ` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cory </PERSON>,''' the diplomat said, speaking anonymously. He was referring to the February 1986 popular uprising that swept President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. `` So far the students have been concentrating on scrutinizing the abuses of the regime and not the relative merits of the different opposition leaders,'' he said. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s last multiparty elections, on Feb. 6, 1960, swept former Prime Minister U Nu to power over an army-backed party. He was toppled in the 1962 coup led by <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who crushed dissent and pursued rigid socialist policies that made resource-rich <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into one of the world's poorest nations. Massive protests began after Ne Win resigned July 23 and the party named hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> his successor. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned after rioting in which at least 112 people died in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, and on Aug. 19, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader since Nu.

<HEAD>India Announces Cease-Fire To Allow Rebels to Surrender</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Wednesday announced a five-day ceasefire in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to allow Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland to surrender their arms and take part in local elections. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Aftab </PERSON> <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> made the announcement to reporters in a government statement. The cease-fire was to begin at 7 a.m. Thursday. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has stationed an estimated 47,000 troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s northern and eastern provinces to enforce an accord aimed at ending the Tamils' 5-year-old separatist war with the Sinhalese-dominated government The campaign has claimed at least 8,500 lives. The cease-fire comes five days after the merger of the two Tamil-dominated provinces and an announcement by the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> government that the election of a combined provincial council would be held soon. A date for the polls has yet to be announced. `` At this juncture it is therefore of the greatest importance that all Tamil groups in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> use this historic opportunity to come forward and participate in the forthcoming provincial council elections,'' the Indian statement said. `` The government of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> hopes that all Tamil groups will ... come forward and join the mainstream of life and play an effective role in ensuring the welfare of the people of the northeastern province,'' it said. `` All groups wishing to participate in the elections must lay down their arms and support the <LOCATION> Indo-Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> agreement,'' the statement said. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, a senior government official said the announcement was sudden. `` Nobody knows what is going on because this is an Indian decision,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Everybody obviously welcomes the cease-fire, but it will have to be studied before any official comments can be made.'' None of the Tamil groups commented on the announcement. The India-brokered peace accord stipulates the surrender of arms by the insurgents in exchange for limited autonomy in the provinces. The rebels briefly accepted the July 1987 accord, but reneged on it last fall, claiming it did not meet their aspirations. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which sponsored the accord because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils, sent troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last October to force the Tamils to surrender. At least 575 Indian soldiers have been killed in hit-and-run attacks by the rebels, and more than 1,700 have been wounded. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> claims its soldiers have killed more than 1,500 rebels and captured 1,300 others but says the Tamil movement is still far from finished. The accord also has been criticized by the Sinhalese, the majority in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. They say the accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils. Sinhalese extremists have vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord and have been blamed for at least 500 deaths since July, including members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Sinhalese also have opposed the merger of the northern and eastern provinces, saying that while the north is Tamil-dominated, the eastern province is multi-racial. Sinhalese extremists have killed at least 26 people since Monday in an apparent reaction to the merger announcement. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, and the Sinhalese make up 75 percent. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, claim they are discriminated by the mainly <PERSON> Buddhist </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who control the island's military and government.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee on a 10 to 9 party-line vote today approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor legislation imposing harsh economic sanctions against white-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Immediately after the vote, leading <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats hailed the action as an important step against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial apartheid and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., called on Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reverse course and support it `` We would certainly welcome his support on this measure,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` We have welcomed other election-year conversions on the part of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He has indicated he wanted to broaden his mandate. He has an excellent opportunity to speak to that issue.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has opposed the legislation which would impose a near-total trade embargo against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and require the withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business investment six months to a year after enactment. Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has supported the bill's attempt to increase the cost of maintaining apartheid on the South African government. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., a principal author of the sanctions bill, told reporters that if Republicans maintain a solid front against the measure it will be difficult to cut off a threatened filibuster against it or to override a likely veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should it be approved He said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership might consider attaching the sanctions bill as an amendment to some other legislation in an effort to assure there is a recorded <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on sanctions before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next month. The committee vote took place after <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> modified the bill to remove a provision that could have caused foreign oil companies to lose American oil leases if they acted to undercut the sanctions legislation. Opponents of the measure had said they feared the provision might cause retaliation by other countries against American oil copmpanies, especially those active in oil exploration and drilling in British territorial waters in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member and leading opponent of sanctions legislation, complained that <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> was unfairly violating a committee agreement and moving to change a bill <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> called a `` turkey.'' `` It's a one-legged turkey that I knew was going to hop around, but it's going nowhere,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. Supporters have admitted they do not have the votes needed to cut off <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate and force a vote or the votes to override a near-certain presidential veto if it passes. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said he had the right to modify the legislation since he sponsored it and said: `` Sen. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> wants to do nothing to improve the bill and nothing to move against apartheid.'' The committee's 10 Democrats voted for the measure and the nine Republicans against it. The bill, intended as a follow-up to a set of milder sanctions enacted over a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto in 1986, would require an end to most trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business investment from the racially divided nation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved similar legislation on Aug. 11. Republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunity last week to vote on amendments as some <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators said changes might make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose. The 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition of senators from both parties. But only a few Republicans have indicated they are ready to support a stronger set of sanctions, with some contending that a trade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to encourage <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to end the country's system of forced racial separation and control known as apartheid. They also said that adopting the sanctions bill now would foreclose the options of the next president whether he be Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who opposes sanctions, or Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who favors them. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also opposes the legislation, contending its passage might disrupt U.S.-mediated talks among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> aimed at South African withdrawal from the territory of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means of sending a strong signal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing to pay a price to end the apartheid system. They said the issue is a moral one, not political, and that sanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violent revolution inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by moving that country toward multiracial democratic rule.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Differences In Cells Of Alcoholics</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: cAMP is cq.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 Scientists today reported finding signs of a genetic difference in cells that could help identify people likely to become alcoholics. The researchers are hopeful the discovery may also explain why some people become addicted to alcohol and how that can be prevented. Studies showed that descendants of white blood cells taken from alcoholics adapt to alcohol more quickly than normal cells. The abnormal response was in the cells' production of a messenger molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP. The molecule is used in all cells to relay messages from outside the cell to various locations inside. The researchers previously noted cAMP abnormalities in the cells of actively drinking alcoholics. In an effort to find the cause of the abnormalities, they raised cells from alcoholics for up to six generations over seven or eight days without exposing the cells to alcohol. These `` teetotaler cells'' showed surprisingly high levels of cAMP, three times the level found in descendants of cells taken from non-alcoholics. The researchers also found the cells with the high cAMP levels had an increased sensitivity to alcohol while the progeny of cells taken from non-alcoholics showed no significant change. The discovery took place at the <ORGANIZATION> Ernest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The findings are reported in the mid-September issue of the Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> by Dr. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. The evidence of a genetic difference is not conclusive, but it appears to confirm prior epidemiologic findings that there is a genetic component to alcoholism, the scientists said. `` Because the sensitivity could be genetic, we now have to go out and do genetic studies in families and confirm that this increased sensitivity to alcohol is the reason why certain people are at risk to become addicted to alcohol,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION>, a professor of neurology, pediatrics and pharmacology at <ORGANIZATION> UCSF </ORGANIZATION> and director of the Gallo Center. <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said that alterations in the cAMP levels may help explain withdrawal symptoms and other problems associated with alcoholism. Volunteers in the study included actively drinking alcoholics with a lifetime ethanol consumption of at least one ton and non-alcoholics drawn from a local Mormon church group and laboratory staff.

<TEXT>
 Five months after lawmakers ousted Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from office, voters have given him a measure of vengeance by rejecting seven Republican legislators who helped impeach and convict him. `` We stand at the dawn of a great awakening in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said Tuesday night after defeating <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary by 6,548 votes to 5,610 votes. `` The people of this state have begun the process of regaining control of their state government.'' But the results of the voting hardly constituted a sweep by the pro-Mecham forces. Republicans who opposed him had little difficulty gaining nomination in areas outside of his traditional strongholds of rural <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and some parts of suburban <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Overall, 35 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislators faced primary challenges, and 27 of those advanced to the general election. One of the losers was Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, a conservative and a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporter who lost his north <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> seat to a moderate. Tuesday's primary was the first legislative election since the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached the ultra-conservative <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in February and the GOP-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him in April of obstructing justice and misusing funds. That automatically installed Democrat <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, the longtime secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, in his place until 1990. Among those losing a bid for renomination was House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who started the impeachment process last fall. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumaker </PERSON> captured both <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> slots in his district. `` I'm not sure next year's going to be very much fun for anyone down at the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> had said Tuesday night as the results became clear. Without the impeachment proceedings, `` I believe the speaker and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have been re-elected,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> home. But he also said the real issue in the primary was the incumbents' votes for higher taxes, approved after he was removed from office to remedy a budget deficit. The other casualties were pro-impeachment Sens. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, along with pro-impeachment Reps. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hungerford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. `` It's a ` Mecham factor' if you ask me,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` But I'll tell you, if I was asked to vote again tomorrow, I'd vote to impeach him.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, asked about the implications for his own political future, replied: `` I've said many times that the result of the 1988 elections was not a vote on whether I should run in'90 or not. That decision will be made by me sometime in the middle of next year.'' In southeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s 5th Congressional District, two-term <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> handily defeated his challengers, including former Douglas Mayor <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, whose nomination for state liquor superintendent <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> withdrew when <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> came under investigation in a decades-old slaying. <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> had 38,169 votes, or 78 percent, to political newcomer <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s 5,855 votes, or 12 percent; <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had 5,077 votes, or 10 percent.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spelled out positions on major weapons systems and promised a White House `` strategy for keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong'' today as a new poll showed Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with wide support on defense issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, also focused on military defense in a speech prepared for delivery in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Under this administration, <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has been promoted and our conventional forces have been neglected,'' he said. `` In the real world, real wars are still fought with real tanks and guns and fighter planes.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, campaigning for his vice president, said in remarks prepared for delivery in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, that the election gives voters `` the choice between the policies of liberalism or the policies of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s political mainstream.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning for Hispanic votes at a <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said today, `` They have n't begun to see me fight for the vote of the Hispanic-Americans, all the way from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the West.'' In a pitch on patriotism, he said sales of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags have risen since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981 `` whereas in the previous administration things were rough in the flag business.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officials released new details of the debate schedule, saying the presidential contenders would follow their Sept. 25 meeting in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, with a debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on either Oct. 13 or 14. The vice presidential candidates will debate Oct. 5 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> planned a visit today to <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. A new Gallup survey indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is leading by an 8-point margin, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is suffering his highest negative rating of the presidential race. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll also showed the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee trailing by 8 points, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> capitalizing on defense issues. A <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> nationwide poll released today also showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strength on the defense issue. Among registered voters surveyed, 54 percent identified <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate who would best ensure a strong defense while only 20 percent answered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The Democratic presidential nominee used a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today to promise changes that would bring order to Pentagon priorities after what he said were eight years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration waste and mismanagement. He endorsed a number of weapons, but he also said, `` We're not going to have a laundry list of weapons systems. We're going to have a strategy for keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was committed to the traditional triad of land -, air - and sea-based military But he said criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense recommendations and said the vice president has failed to discuss the Pentagon procurement scandal. `` We have what you might call a new type of Republican triad today: waste, duplication and fraud,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his promise to make improved conventional forces his top defense priority if he is elected and said he favored rapid development of new tanks and anti-tank weapons, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarine and new weapons to fight Soviet submarines. He expressed opposition to the proposed rail-based MX missile, and he stated anew his concern that the B-1 bomber would be unable to perform the job for which it was designed. Both the MX and the B-1 are supported by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Campaigning in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged his support for expansion of American markets abroad and suggested that Democrats are only concerned with production controls, similar to the grain embargo imposed by former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. They want to `` control the lives of the farmers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited a published report that quoted a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee might re-examine the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of selling government subsidized wheat to the Soviets. `` Can you imagine another president who leaves open the door of using agriculture products to make the political points and using our producers in that way?'' he asked. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a new television commercial that uses a `` crime quiz'' to hit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the law and order issue. The ad scores the Democrat on issues such as the death penalty and his state's inmate furlough program before an announcer asks viewers, `` Which candidate for president can you really count on to be tough on crime?'' The answer comes, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign accepted the resignation of a seventh adviser with alleged ties to anti-Semitic activities, hoping for an end to the controversy. <PERSON> Radi </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavoff </PERSON> quit his post as national co-chairman of `` Bulgarians for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' following a story in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer that identified him as former chief of a Bulgarian group formed after World War II which consisted of members of the Nazi-aligned Bulgarian Legion. Defense plants are common stops on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign trail but now <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has chosen the sites to counter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on his defense record. The two latest polls indicate that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' approach is a must The CBS-Times poll, which showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead 47-39 percent, found that 28 percent of the probable voters surveyed believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would make the nation stronger while only 4 percent said he would weaken its defense. In comparison, 39 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defenses weaker and 13 percent said stronger. The poll surveyed 1,043 probable voters from Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup poll, which found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading 49-41 percent, showed that 40 percent have an unfavorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, up from 32 percent last month and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's highest all year. Fifty-three percent gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a favorable rating. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a 59 percent favorable rating and a 35 percent unfavorable. The Gallup survey of 1,003 registered voters was done Friday through Sunday and had a 4-point margin of error. The Los Angeles Times Poll was conducted over the weekend with 1,105 registered voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed 47 percent support among the 656 called most likely to vote. The Times poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today endorsed a long list of weapons sstems he said made sense for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense and would bring cohesion to Pentagon priorities after eight years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration waste and mismanagement. `` We've got to have leadership in the Pentagon that will take charge of our defense policy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` And we've got to have a president who will keep faith with the men and women we ask to defend freedom and liberty around the world.'' While endorsing a number of weapons programs, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also reiterated his opposition to several favored by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, including the rail-based MX missile, and he expressed anew his concern that the B-1 bomber would be unable to perform the job for which it was designed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he favored continued research on a strategic defense system but at about $ 1 billion a year, far below what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to spend on the so-called Star Wars system. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said that while he agreed in concept with the Midgetman missile he was not convinced the costly program was needed to modernize the land-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear deterrent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his promise to make improved conventional forces his top defense priority if he is elected and said he favored rapid development of new tanks and anti-tank weapons, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarine and new weapons to fight Soviet submarines. He also reiterated his backing of the Trident II submarine-based missile system, the Stealth bomber and advanced cruise missiles. `` We're not going to have a laundry list of weapons systems,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We're going to have a strategy for keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong.'' Later, at a rally in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, before heading home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the Democratic nominee taunted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for refusing to agree to a presidential debate originally scheduled for tonight in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> capital. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't ready today after more than seven and a half years as vice president of this country, how can we expect him to be ready on Jan. 20, 1989?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I are ready.'' He jokingly suggested that the reason <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to come to the home of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy was `` that his idea of a naval exercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard.'' That was a reference to the recent resignation of six officials of a pro-Bush ethnic campaign organization who allegedly had pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic ties. At <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of playing politics by convincing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto a defense authorization bill recently passed with bipartisan support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and said the veto had prevented an expanded role for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in the war on drugs and long-overdue pay and benefit increases for military forces. `` My friends, we ca n't play politics with our national security,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He promised to work diligently toward new arms control measures and a nuclear test ban treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but also said he would demand significant cutbacks in Soviet conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and call for the dismantling of the Soviets' SS-18 missiles. Despite spending billions on defense, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has done little to improve the nation's security. `` The fact is that the Republicans promised in 1980 to make our land-based missiles invulnerable and, today, after another $ 25 billion and eight years of Republican mismanagement, our ICBMs are more vulnerable that they were in 1980.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was committed to the traditional triad of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense policy: land -, air - and sea-based strategic But he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had shown no cohesion in his priorities and has failed to discuss the Pentagon procurement scandal. `` We have what you might call a new type of Republican triad today: waste, duplication and fraud,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said that as commander-in-chief he would not shy away from using military force if necessary. `` We'll use force when it's necessary to protect our territory, our citizens or vital interests; to meet our treaty commitments, and to deter or respond to terrorist attacks,'' he said.

 An armed man who barricaded himself in a house for more than 30 hours, convinced the world was coming to an end as prophesied in a religious booklet, was overpowered by police and arrested today, authorities said. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>, 27, fired shots at passing motorists and a police officer, but no one was injured, police said. `` He was messed up real bad on religion,'' said <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>' aunt, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON>. She said two door-to-door missionaries for the <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witness sect apparently convinced her nephew he needed to `` get right'' because Tuesday would be the day that God called true believers to heaven. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> predicted in his booklet `` 88 Reasons Why the Rapture Will Be in 1988,'' that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would `` rapture the church'' and take the faithful to heaven by sunset Tuesday. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said Tuesday he still believed the `` rapture'' was imminent and revised the moment to 10:55 a.m. EDT today. That deadline passed without apparent incident. <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON> was arrested after negotiators got him to step outside his back door shortly after 2 a.m. today, said police dispatcher <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garinger </PERSON>. Sheriff's deputies then lobbed concussion grenades at <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>, stunning him, she said. <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON> was charged with assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon and terrorizing the public. Few preachers seemed to take the <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> book seriously. `` There are maybe a few concerned. There's a lot of interest,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, pastor of the 2,000-member <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` We have difficulty with the book. The scripture is very clear that that's not something known to man. It's known only to God.'' Others said it did n't matter that the predictions were wrong. `` My awareness has been quickened and I'll never be the same,'' said <PERSON> Helaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juliet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` If people mock us, I'm still happy because mockers are another biblical prophecy that will come true in the last days. A <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> theologian said he wo n't be surprised if there are more predictions of a Second Coming. `` Every time they predict and it does n't come to pass ... they do n't get embarrassed by that. They just reload. And they say ` We miscalculated,''' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Efird </PERSON>, professor of biblical interpretation at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s Divinity School. About 1 million copies of the book have been circulated throughout the nation, with about two-thirds sold for $ 2 and the rest given away, said the Rev. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doom </PERSON>, who runs a Christian bookstore in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Swedens Lodges Protest Over 1948 Slaying Of Swedish U.N. Mediator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Wednesday issued a formal protest to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over the 1948 slaying of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON> by the Jewish underground <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>. A former member said the killing was justified. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was called to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and handed a note expressing the government's `` shock, dissatisfaction and indignation that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has not reacted after the new reports about the murder,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. In interviews broadcast and published over the weekend, members of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the Stern Gang, acknowledged they were involved in the shooting death of <LOCATION> Bernadotte </LOCATION> on Sept. 17, 1948. They said <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, a Swedish count who was on a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, was slain because of his plan to give the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> control over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and hand over key areas to the Arabs. The group was a splinter faction of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Since the slaying, the group has been widely believed to be responsible, but the killers were never found despite a widespread manhunt. Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Erell </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting Wednesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> expressed its regrets immediately after the slaying and had not changed its position, national radio reported. He made no comments during the meeting with Ambassador <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohrn </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> section, the radio reported. In 1945, <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON> led an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> operation that rescued 30,000 concentration camp victims from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and resettled them in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheib-Eldad </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday the killing prevented `` a disaster for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` I'm not saying every assassination is good but this one was good. I want to state that 40 years later. An act of individual terror can be good and bad. In this case, it was good,'' said <PERSON> Eldad </PERSON>, who has not claimed to be involved in the slaying. The underground group was named after leader <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who was killed by British police in 1942. The group then was jointly headed by <PERSON> Eldad </PERSON>, the late <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yellin-Mor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prime minister. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> has denied the premier was involved in the killing and contended the group was officially disbanded about four months before <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s death.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> battered the resorts of the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> today with 160 mph winds and torrential rains. Thousands of people fled coastal areas for shelters inland. `` The wind was blowing out windows everywhere'' in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, an official said of the resort where thousands of Americans vacation each year. Residents along the gulf coast of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 560 miles to the north, stockpiled food and supplies and prepared to evacuate. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said early today he expects <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> to make landfall on the Texas-Louisiana coast in 48 to 60 hours. The hurricane, one of the strongest in history, is `` extremely dangerous,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The storm's winds reached 175 mph earlier today, but later fell slightly to 160 mph, the weather service said Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, according to reports from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which has killed at least 11 people, moved over the island of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> at 10 a.m. EDT, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, a spokesman for the governor's office in <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, who spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said heavy rain was falling over the peninsula and communications with <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> were out. <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> is 240 miles east of <LOCATION> Medira </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> is 12 miles off the Yucatan coast. Military and civilian teams evacuated more than 16,000 people from coastal areas on the upper Yucatan coast between <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lagartos </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> said. Most are in shelters in inland towns, he said. `` Many people were reluctant to leave their homes,'' <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> said. `` They had to be convinced of the seriousness of the threat.'' Officials in <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION> last spoke with people in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> early today before the center of the storm hit. `` Electricity is down,'' he said. `` We talked to them early in the morning and they said it was impressive _ all dark. The people were afraid. The wind was blowing out windows everywhere.'' Heavy rains began in <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION> about 6 a.m. EDT, and the storm was expected to dump 5 to 10 inches on the area. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said the eye of the storm was over northeast Yucatan at noon EDT. The center of the storm was located near latitude 20.7 north and longitude 87.3 west, or about 150 miles east of <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>. The hurricane was moving toward the west northwest at 15 mph. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> pounded the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the low-lying <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. At least 11 people were reported killed, and at least 60,000 were left homeless in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. Rescue teams worked desperately to restore utilities and communications in the shattered areas. In a telephone call early today, receptionist <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> of the Carrillos Hotel in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> said about 150 people, most of them tourists, were crowded in the lobby on sofas and chairs. `` We are full, and there is not one tourist now in the beach hotel zone,'' he said. `` The sound of the wind outside is horrible. You could n't leave even if you wanted to.'' He said the winds felled utility poles and trees and that sheets of rain were hitting the city. <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, a representative of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consul, said she did not know how many tourists were in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, but that government figures estimate between 40,000 and 65,000 a month. <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> has a population of about 100,000, she said. High winds also were reported in <LOCATION> Valladolid </LOCATION>, a city of 80,000 located 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Martil </PERSON>, local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> president. Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said late Tuesday that at least six people were killed, and an estimated 60,000 were left homeless in `` the worst natural disaster in the modern history of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>.'' Civil defense officials in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported five people were known dead. The hurricane center said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure. It was measured at 26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. `` That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage. Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Hurricane Camille that devastated the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.

<HEAD>Postal Service Picks Up With 80,000 Staff Working</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Postal service picked up today as more workers returned to their jobs to begin sorting out the backlog of 150 million letters and parcels from a two-week dispute. Mail boxes will remain sealed, however, until backlogs are mostly cleared, said <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfield </PERSON>. She said 80,000 of the service's 140,000 workers were back at work today, two days after the strike was settled subject to local negotiations over details of workers' return. About 100,000 workers were involved in the stoppage called by the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` All staff should be back to work Thursday,'' Ms. <PERSON> Corfield </PERSON> said. `` But we will not start unsealing post boxes until the backlog has been dealt with.'' She said 34 of the country's 82 major sorting offices were operating and about half of the total 1,500 letter-handling offices had started up again. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, only two of the city's 17 major sorting offices were operating, she said. Staff at <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, York and <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> have voted not to return to work. The limited deliveries made Tuesday had increased today, she said, although she did not have details. The agreement reached Monday resolved a dispute over regional pay bonuses, an issue that prompted a 24-hour walkout Aug. 31 which later mushroomed into nationwide strikes. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> wants to pay bonuses to new workers in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> where the high cost of living makes retaining workers difficult. The union said it wanted the bonuses paid nationally or not at all. Under the agreement, local negotiations were to discuss the issue of whether temporary workers would be allowed to sort the backlog, the union said.

<TEXT>
 The Sunday school lesson that morning 25 years ago was on forgiving love, but racial hatred that had gripped <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> for months erupted in a dynamite explosion that tore into the church and killed four black girls. The blast at the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963, seared the conscience of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s largest city, which had become known as a segregationist battleground, and helped bring to it a quarter-century of change. The bombing, which is to be marked in a service Thursday night, came at a time when some city leaders already were trying to find a way toward racial harmony. Less than a year earlier, the city government had been reorganized to replace the powerful, three-member commission with a nine-member city council. One of those commissioners, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> `` Bull'' Connor, had gained national notoriety when he ordered that dogs and fire hoses be used against civil rights demonstrators. The bombing followed a series of blasts that had occurred since the 1950s, although no one had died in the earlier explosions. The church, near the local office of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, was often used for rallies by blacks seeking changes in what <PERSON> King </PERSON> had called the most segregated city in the country The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, pastor of the church at the time, said at least three bomb threats had been made before the bombing, prompting all-night watches at the church for a while. `` We had just about relaxed the protection of the church,'' he said. `` It looked like everything was working with ease. We thought peace would prevail.'' J.L. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who directed the church orchestra, said church members `` said surely nobody's going to bomb the church while there are inhabitants.'' But at about 10:20 a.m. Sunday, Sept. 15, an explosion tore apart the side entrance to the building. A bomb had been placed beneath concrete steps near the window of a basement restroom. <PERSON> Addie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, all 14, and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, 11, were in the restroom preparing for a special youth program. They were killed and two other girls were injured. King, himself later the victim of an assassin's bullet, preached at the combined funeral of three of the blast victims.

<HEAD>Americans Witness Soviet Nuclear Test For First Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEMIPALATINSK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The land heaved and windows broke more than two miles away Wednesday when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> detonated a underground nuclear bomb for the first American experts to witness a Soviet nuclear blast. The Americans stood in a chilly wind on the barren test site at the Forward Command Post Semipalatinsk Polygon about 1,700 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. The wind blew the Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags in the direction of the test range, far from the nearest settlement on the steppes of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and a four-hour bus ride from the city of <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION>. As the shock wave rippled out, the ground shook and a low rumble began. Within moments of the 11 a.m. blast, a reddish dust cloud rolled above the spot where Soviet scientists planted a nuclear device in a shaft drilled 642 yards into hard rock. Some observers seemed a bit queezy from their proximity to ground zero, only 2.4 miles away. Soviet observers watching a similar test on Aug. 17 in <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, remained about 30 miles from the blast site _ too far away to feel the impact. It was the first time Soviet experts were allowed to see a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear test and monitor it with their own equipment. After Wednesday's test, the Soviet scientists quickly checked their instruments and announced they had obtained the data necessary to determine the force of the blast. The information was gathered in a few millionths of a second before the explosion destroyed the sensor cable buried a few yards from the nuclear device. The Soviets and the Americans, who monitored the blast with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology, have agreed to release the data within a month. The blast was designed to have a force of 100 to 150 kilotons, about 10 times that of the atomic bomb the Americans dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, at the end of World War II, but less powerful than the multimegaton hydrogen bombs detonated in the atmosphere at the height of nuclear testing in the 1960s. The Hagfors Observatory of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Establishment </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> explosion measured between 50 and 150 kilotons. The joint experiment was the culmination of a `` dream for many experts who have spent their careers watching and studying their counterparts from a distance,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks on limiting nuclear tests. `` We are extremely pleased,'' said Deputy <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> <PERSON> Solgado </PERSON>. `` The experiment went very well for both sides.'' <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON>, head of the Soviet observation team, said, `` If the Americans had any doubt about our level of science and technology in a nuclear field, now they know.'' Both sides expressed confidence the test explosion would lead to ratification of treaties limiting the size of underground nuclear blasts. At a news conference in a trailer village that served as the command post for the test, <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said Wednesday's experiment and the one like it in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> `` have demonstrated the effectiveness and non-intrusiveness of <LOCATION> CORRTEX </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology developed to gauge the force of nuclear explosions. The Soviets, however, remain sceptical that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> on-site measuring system offers a long-term solution to the problem of verifying nuclear tests. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilyenko </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> test site, said it was too early to determine whether the American method was non-intrusive _ meaning it does not interfere with the blast or pick up other data the country doing the testing would like to keep secret. <PERSON> Ilyenko </PERSON> called for a continuing search for simpler, more precise measuring techniques. Spokesmen for both sides agreed the experiments will speed negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on verification protocols needed to ratify two treaties signed but not ratified in the 1970s that limit the force of underground nuclear explosions. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side still hopes the treaties can be ratified before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends Jan. 20, 1989. The treaties limit underground nuclear test explosions to a strength of 150 kilotons. The two superpowers say they will abide by the agreements, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it will not ratify the documents until adequate provisions are included against cheating and monitoring techniques both sides could use to measure tests and verify compliance, according to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The talks on nuclear testing began in July 1986 and formal negotiations started last November. The Soviets support a complete ban on nuclear testing. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says the tests are necessary as long as nuclear weapons exist, but want the number of nuclear explosions reduced in tandem with arms stockpiles.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, under <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attack as weak on defense, came on like a hawk Wednesday, citing a range of weapons systems he supports and accusing his opponents of a `` smoke and mirrors'' military policy. `` We'll use force when it's necessary to protect our territory, our citizens or our vital interests, to meet our treaty commitments and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Portrayed by Republicans <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as an opponent of most major weapons systems, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> countered by describing the nation's military as suffering from years of neglect during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said there are shortages of tanks and anti-tank weapons and carrier aircraft. And he said a backlog of undone essential maintenance work in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> `` is greater now than it was when this administration took office.'' He also said there was a shortage of medical personnel. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would press ahead with development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the Sea Wolf attack submarine, if elected. He also criticized the administration for decommissioning 16 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigates. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said Democrats and Republicans alike have `` the job of defending freedom'' and added: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unfortunately forgot that lesson last month when he persuaded the president to veto the defense bill over the objections of the secretary of defense and the national security adviser. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pollster apparently had more influence than they did.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> complained at the time that the bill cut too much into Star Wars funding and contained Democratic-written arms-control provisions. In what has become a daily jab at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to be looking for guidance on national security issues from <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' Later, at an <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, rally before he headed home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the Democratic nominee taunted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for refusing to agree to a debate originally scheduled for Wednesday night in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> capital. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't ready today after more than seven and a half years as vice president of this country, how can we expect him to be ready on January 20, 1989?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I are ready.'' He also took a poke at the vice president for the recent resignations of six campaign advisers on ethnic voters because of allegations that they had pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic ties. `` Maybe the reason <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't come here to <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> -LRB- home of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy -RRB- is that his idea of a naval exercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, the candidate was introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who said the defense budget into the 1990s would be `` flat at best. He said the next president would have to maintain a `` strong defense in the face of restrained dollars.'' Also seated on the stage was Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Responding to the Republican attacks, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We've had a lot of nonsense lately from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the subject of national defense.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said that the Trident II missile program and development of the Stealth bomber were started under <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. He said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981 with a promise to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> land-based missiles invulnerable to Soviet attack. But he said that after `` eight years of Republican mismanagement, our ICBMs are more vulnerable than they were in 1980.'' `` It's time for an end to Republican smoke and mirrors on national defense,'' he said, calling the MX missile, which he opposes, a `` sitting duck.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also opposes the proposed Midgetman missile, a single-warhead weapon favored by some as an alternative to the multi-warhead MX. But in this speech, he tempered his opposition to Midgetman, saying, `` The strategic concept of the Midegetman is sound, but I question the value of spen ding $ 40 billion or $ 50 billion for 500 additional land-based missile warheads _ at three times the cost of the same number of new submarine-based warheads.'' Both <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> support the missile. While seeking to clarify his own position on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, the space-based missile defense system being pushed by the administration, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of waffling. `` I'm beinning to get the feeling that one of the reasons Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is so reluctant to debate me is that he's so busy debating himself,'' he said. `` One day he wants to speed up SDI -LRB- Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB-. The next day he does not.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, once counted a staunch opponent of SDI, has said he would continue research and recently also said he would deploy it if it were deemed essential to the national interest. At <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> he made no mention of deployment. Instead, he said, `` If we're going to make our defense dollars count, we've got to stop pouring billions and billions into this program and do some hard thinking about what we're trying to achieve.'' He said that rather than scrap the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty as some administration officials have suggested, `` I will protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> security ... by insisting that the Soviets live up to it and that they dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar.'' Administration officials have called the radar a violation of the treaty.

<HEAD>Researcher Urges Use of Fetal Transplant Tissue to Treat
Parkinson's Disease</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Swedish doctor who has transplanted brain cells from aborted human fetuses to patients with Parkinson's disease said Wednesday the procedure is so promising it would be unethical not to make it available to desperately ill people Dr. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, professor of neurobiology at <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and one of the few people in the world to have transplanted human fetal tissue, also told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee the technique has been used in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. There are no known cases of fetal tissue being transplanted as a treatment for Parkinson's disease in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but several animal studies have suggested the procedure can be effective. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> outlined his work with green monkeys. With a video tape, he showed remarkable improvement in monkeys in which Parkinson's was induced and then treated with brain cells taken from healthy monkeys. One of the questions the committee specifically has been asked to answer is whether animal studies have been numerous and successful enough to warrant going forward with similar experimental treatment on humans. When one of the panel members directed that question to <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, he replied: `` The animal data ... are so promising we have approached a point where I believe it is unethical not to do this in human studies.'' The special <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee was appointed at the direction of Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, the federal government's assistant secretary for health, after he denied permission for <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> scientists to proceed with human fetal tissue transplants without formal consideration of moral and ethical questions raised by the emerging field of research Even before the group could hold its first meeting, however, it was learned last week that a White House official has drafted a proposed executive order that would ban all such research. Most of the opposition comes from people and organizations opposed to abortion in general. They maintain that allowing such research could encourage more abortions. The advisory committee devoted its first daylong session to scientific issues and will turn to legal and ethical considerations Thursday before draftings its recommendations on Friday. The matter then goes to a standing <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee Dec. 1 for final recommendations to <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>. Despite the focus on presentations by some of the nation's top researchers who say fetal tissue transplants hold potential for treating diabetes, Alzheimer's and many other diseases, it was clear the scientists and doctors were well aware of ethical considerations. For example, there have been instances of women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expressing a desire to become pregnant just to produce a fetus that would be aborted to treat a relative with Parkinson's disease `` There are rumors that this has been done in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the pathology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think this is ethically unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> made no claims of dramatic improvements for the two patients he implanted with fetal brain cells eight months ago. `` There have been no adverse effects,'' he said. `` It appears that we are seeing minor positive changes in the patients.'' He pointed out that both patients, women in their 50s, have been suffering from severe Parkinson's for 15 years and he was optimistic that the marginal improvement seen so far will intensify as the implanted brain cells mature. Parkinson's, which causes a loss of muscle control, is caused by a shortage of cells that produce a brain chemical called dopamine. It is these dopamine-producing cells that are transplanted from fetuses.

 A gunman took 11 hostages at a military recruiting station today but freed them unharmed hours later after two radio stations agreed to air a statement asserting his goal was `` peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' He surrendered moments later, shortly before 2 p.m. No one was injured. The unidentified gunman, who had described himself as `` a local person of Lebanese descent,'' was armed with an AK-47, an automatic rifle that is standard issue in Communist countries, said police Lt. <PERSON> C.M </PERSON>. Schesventer. Police negotiated by telephone with the man, who had claimed two armed companions, but police learned from freed captives there was only one gunman. The 11 captives _ nine military personnel and two civilians _ included a high school senior enlisting in the service, said <PERSON> Schesventer </PERSON>. Hostages began coming out, alone and in twos, about every 10 minutes shortly after radio stations WRNL-AM and WRXL-FM twice aired a message at the gunman's demand around noon, said <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, news director at the stations. `` There is a hostage situation at Tuckernuck Square Shopping Center,'' the statement read. `` There have been no injuries. Negotiations are proceeding. The hostage-takers have so far been cooperative. They're holding an undetermined number of people. The hostage-takers' goal is peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruiting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is in a shopping center that includes 30 stores. All were evacuated. Local and state police carrying automatic weapons ringed the area.

 American rice farmers complained Wednesday that their crops are being frozen out of the Japanese market and asked for government help including trade retaliation if needed. `` The time has come for the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to take the steps necessary for us to compete in our market,'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., told a news conference at which the action was announced Groups representing rice producers and millers asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> for assistance on grounds that Japanese refusal to permit rice imports amounts to an unfair trade barrier. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has 45 days to decide whether to take the case. If he did so, the next step would be to engage in talks with the Japanese. If that failed, the government would seek relief under the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. Failure to get results after two years of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> negotiations would require retaliation under the new trade law approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this summer. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the American farmer's best customer. It bought more than $ 5.5 billion worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products last year and is expected to account for $ 6.9 billion in purchases this year, more than any other country. Many of these goods, such as corn, are not grown in quantity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It has imported only a tiny trickle of rice, maintaining restraints in an effort to protect its farmers from foreign competition. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other American producers, engaging in high-tech, large-scale farming, can grow rice at far below the costs of Japanese counterparts and, if all trade restraints were swept away, could be expected to command a substantial share of the Japanese market in short order. Industry officials said rice priced at $ 300 a ton in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would cost $ 2,500 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They told the news conference, however, they have no intention of trying to wipe out Japanese rice farming. `` We are not looking for an opportunity to flood the Japanese market,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The group filed the trade petition in a joint effort with the <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, a growers group. The petition seeks to gain 2.5 percent of the Japanese rice market in the first of a four-year phase-in and expand to 10 percent, or 1 million tons, by the fourth year. Senators from rice-producing states were on hand to push the petition, with Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., declaring that the industry had tried to get the Japanese to import American rice voluntarily `` As always the response has been a virtual stone wall,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` And that is not good enough.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, campaigning for his vice president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, blamed Democrats Wednesday for `` economic and foreign policy nightmares.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised his own record in office during a speech prepared for a campaign rally at <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and he envisioned a return to high inflation and other economic problems as well as a loss of American prestige if the Democrats win in November. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has traveled such a remarkable distance in the last eight years that the memory has faded of the economic and foreign policy crises that we faced when Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I took office,'' he said in the latest in a series of out-of-town forays <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will make to promote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Republican candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's memory lane, it starts to look like ` Nightmare on Elm Street,''' he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who won roughly 60 percent of the popular vote in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> in his race against Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, was traveling later in the day to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to speak at a $ 250-a-plate fund-raising dinner. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the expenses for the trip from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were being paid by the state and national Republican parties. In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> brought back a familiar refrain _ that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders harbor gloom-and-doom views of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future in the world _ although he never mentioned the name of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> He did say that in 1979, the nation was facing double-digit inflation and interest rates at home while being faced with the seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the Soviet incursion into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Do n't we have the right to ask the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people: If the liberals return to power, what happens in 1989?'' he asked. `` When the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people saw that under the other fellows, the economic misery index was soaring off the charts, they wanted a change, and who did they call? <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and me _ the malaise-busters.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that during the flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the president decided not to use the `` malaise-busters'' phrase because `` he said he was just uncomfortable with the language.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report Wednesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit fell in July to $ 9.5 billion, the lowest level since December 1984. `` When <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> goes into the market to compete, we plan to win,'' he said. `` Others may talk, but we deliver.'' `` Today, we have peace and prosperity,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And the liberals are trying to pretend those economic and foreign policy nightmares they gave us never happened.'' Several state Republicans, including Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, hoped to benefit from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fund-raising appearances. <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> is seeking a second term against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the wife of former Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>.

 that they are stifling competition in the air travel industry, a congressional report said Wednesday. The study concluded that the reservation systems are generating profits `` exceeding those that could reasonably be expected to be earned in a competitive market.'' It also chided the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> for failing to take steps to eliminate the `` anti-competitive features'' of the computer reservation industry. `` DOT has a statutory responsibility to protect competition in the airline industry,'' said the report, which was written by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' nonpartisan investigative agency. The computer systems whic budget deficit, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> praised both the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for their efforts, which have whittled the deficit from $ 220 billion in 1986 to an estimated $ 150 billion this year. `` I do think we can grow our way out of this,'' he said, adding at another point, `` I see no reason at this moment why taxes have to be raised.'' Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., urged <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to offer more than `` platitudes'' on the budget <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> declined to recommend specifics, but promised to present <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with new ideas for reducing the deficit by the end of the year. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, gave <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> a warm endorsement, even though <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is a close adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is a friend and former colleague and in my opinion is a man who is well qualified to be treasury secretary,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` It's a big job, a tough job, but you're used to tough jobs.'' In his latest government assignment, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> headed a presidential task force that studied the causes of the October stock market crash. His report called for greater regulation over some aspects of the markets and was met with a cold shoulder by the administration. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said market reforms put in place since the crash have been `` on the right track,'' declining to criticize the administration for not doing everything his commission advised. `` I'm not sure we were 100 percent right.

<HEAD>Steering Problems Suspected In United Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 that skidded off a runway at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> may have experienced steering problems before the accident occurred, a federal aviation official said. One person out of the 207 aboard suffered minor injuries in Monday's mishap. The pilot `` had some problems with the steering, he went off the runway, and they evacuated,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` They did have some steering problems. ... The nose tire did show some chafing, which meant it was sliding, which usually indicates a steering problem, like you're dragging it sideways across the pavement,'' he said. Pilots who witnessed the incident said the pilot apparently overshot the runway landing area, touching down 4,000 to 5,000 feet from the start of the runway, instead of within the 3,000 feet required by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. Federal records also showed that the plane had problems with its landing gear three times this summer. Tracks left by the jetliner's tires indicate that it veered from the rain-wet runway on a high-speed taxiway about 1,000 feet down from the touchdown point. After it landed, the plane traveled nearly 2,000 feet on grass and dirt beside the 10,000-foot-long runway and bumped over two taxiway crossings. Its nose landing gear collapsed near a third taxiway crossing, said <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> and a licensed air transport pilot, watched the plane touch down from his office near the runway. The pilot, he said, `` was at the normal altitude and speed -LRB- for landing -RRB- but he was too far down the runway. There was a lot of black smoke and debris flying; it may be that he blew a tire then.'' In two previous incidents involving the landing gear, crews flying the plane reported that nose-wheel warning lights went off as the aircraft was preparing to land, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. On a third occasion, warning lights for all three of the plane's landing gear illuminated as the aircraft took off. In each instance, the problem was corrected, and no accident occurred, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Although the cause of the accident is still under investigation, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the airline concluded the type of problems reported on the landing gear earlier could not have been a factor.

<TEXT>
 The savings and loan where <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> kept some donations for her son's medical care should have frozen the funds after the boy died, the estate's curator contends in court documents. Nearly $ 690,000, including $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, was donated to pay for liver transplants for 7-year-old <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, who died in April 1987 while awaiting his fourth liver transplant at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s Children's Hospital. After his death, Coral Gables Federal Savings and Loan did not block Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> from withdrawing of some $ 200,000, which legally belonged to the boy's estate, curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> alleged in motions filed Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` With the widespread national media attention that <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> got, the -LRB- savings and loan -RRB- should have realized that he had died,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said her motions asked for court permission to bring a lawsuit against the savings and loan over the issue. A hearing was scheduled Friday before Probate Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Steene </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Coral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gables </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment Tuesday. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> and her attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, did not return phone messages seeking comment. In the past, the have contended that she had the right to the money because some of the donations were intended just for her personal expenses. The money withdrawn by Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was used to buy a used BMW for $ 13,500, jewelry, clothing and other items. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> signed a court order last month authorizing the seizure of disputed property. The car was seized, but the other items have not yet been taken. Money used to buy the car, and the value of other property and assets recovered during the ongoing legal battle, will be deducted from the amount Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> hopes to obtain from Coral Gables Federal. If Coral Gables Federal is forced to pay the difference to <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s estate, the savings and loan could in turn sue Ms. DeSillers, the curator said.

<TEXT>
 A ransom of $ 22.2 million may have been paid to release a West German hostage despite a round of denials from his employer and government officials, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The Hamburg-based mass-cirulation daily <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said the money was deposited into Arabian bank accounts to secure the freedom of <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, who arrived home Tuesday night after 20 months of captivity. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, 55, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> pharmaceutical company, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers late Monday night. He was first taken to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, who heads the federal government's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> crisis group, strongly denied that money was paid for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' release `` There were no deals. There were no conditions,'' said <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>. `` The release was secured through talks and the help of Iranian and Syrian officials,'' he said, echoing earlier comments by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> also said the government made no concessions in the case of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who is on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on charges of murder and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. Justice Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelhard </PERSON> also said the government `` from the first moment on made it clear that there would be no deals, no release in exchange for the West German hostages.'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released on Sept. 7, 1987. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court for his role in the kidnappings, which were designed to pressure the government into releasing <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. But Bild, citing unidentified security sources, strongly suggested a ransom was paid. `` Despite all denials by the West German government and the <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> company, a sum of millions is believed to have been paid to kidnappers for the release,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a `` security expert'' as saying that millions of dollars were paid for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' release `` Such money is paid discreetly via front men into Arabian bank accounts,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted a `` security expert'' as saying. `` In <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' case there has been talk of at least 40 million marks -LRB- $ 22.2 million -RRB-.'' The newspaper is known to have good sources within the government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The Frankfurt-based <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> company also denied that any money was paid and declared as false a magazine report that it had hired a private detective to deliver the money. <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Felicitas </PERSON> <PERSON> Feick </PERSON> said: `` Our company had nothing to do with this man. No money was paid for Mr. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' release. The Hamburg-based Stern magazine, in a telex to news media, said a man it identified as <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauss </PERSON> was hired by the company to conduct negotiations and deliver money to the hijackers. After his arrival at <LOCATION> Cologne-Bonn </LOCATION> airport Tuesday, <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was immediately flown to an undisclosed location. He remained in seclusion Wednesday. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> told West German television that <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was `` weak but in good health.'' He said <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> told him that he was kept isolated and chained during most of his captivity. `` He was moved often and was in a continuous state of uncertainty. He told me he received few letters from his relatives,'' <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was the last West German hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where 17 other foreigners are held captive. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Concessions For Third World Unjustified, Treasury Chief Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Acting Treasury Secretary <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> spoke out strongly Wednesday for ending Third World trade concessions that he said perpetuate poverty instead of promoting growth. `` Less developed countries can gain much more by negotiating as true trade partners ... than as special pleaders'' in trade talks, he said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a business and public policy research organization. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> attacked the reliance of developing countries on waivers of international trade rules allowing them to use `` import substitution'' and non-reciprocity policies to protect infant industries. He said that during the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round of world trade negotiations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will step up opposition to `` special and differential treatment'' for such countries under the rules of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round, launched at the 1986 world economic conference at <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Este </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, is scheduled for a review session in December at <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Import substitution amounts to protection and `` the old theory that trade protection promotes development is bankrupt, yet <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> still echoes this theory,'' <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said. The accumulation of `` special exemptions and arrangements for developing countries through <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s history has effectively removed less developed countries from obligations under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> principles of nondiscrimination, transparency and reciprocity,'' he asserted. A 1955 <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing poor countries with balance of payments -LRB- BOP -RRB- problems to restrict imports temporarily has been misused to the point that `` the BOP waiver is used to provide lasting cover for import substitution policies,'' he said. `` Some of those quotas have been in place for decades.'' `` Rather than a strategy for economic development, import substitution is a strategy for economic decline,'' <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> asserted. He said the concessions promote inward-looking policies that reduce export capacity, worsen balance of payments and income distribution and depress wages. Not only the free trade city-states of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> but also <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are examples of economies that have prospered under outward-oriented trade policies, <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said. After it `` reversed course and began to liberalize trade'' in 1980, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s annual rises in export growth jumped from 5.5 percent to almost 20 per cent, he said. `` No economy, not even <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has performed better.'' Turkish manufactured goods, 2 percent of exports in 1965, account for 56 percent today, he said.

<TEXT>
 Evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s television audience has dropped sharply over the last year following a sex scandal and his dismissal from the Assemblies of God, according to the Arbitron rating service. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s weekly television program dropped from the top-rated religious telecast in July 1987 to No. 3 in July 1988, with only half the previous audience, <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> found. His daily program dropped from 11th to 17th during the same period, according to <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>, which measures viewership on commercial television stations. The latest figures show his weekly program was viewed by 836,000 households at least once during an average week between July 6 and Aug. 2, down from 1.68 million households a year ago. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was dismissed in May from the Assemblies of God, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, after refusing to submit to a one-year suspension from the pulpit for a reported involvement with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans-area </LOCATION> prostitute. The top-rated religious program, with host <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>, was seen in 1.12 million households this summer, while the No. 2 show, `` The World Tomorrow,'' was seen by 1.19 million households. The number of television markets carrying <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> fell from 192 to 184 during the year. Television evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, founder of the Moral Majority, was rated No. 5 a year ago and fell to No. 10. His viewership fell from 582,000 households in July 1987 to 284,000 this year, or a loss of about 48 percent. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> fell from 171 markets in the past year to 129, according to <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>. Evangelist Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has lost about 35 percent of his audience, according to <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> figures. The July 1988 report showed <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> in the No. 4 spot with 561,000 households, down from 863,000 in July 1987. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was in 121 markets this year as compared to 179 last year.

 A military judge Wednesday denied a defense motion to dismiss all charges against a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescue-swimmer instructor standing court-martial for the drowning of a teen-age recruit. Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON> gave no explanation for his ruling in the case of Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, accused of involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery in the death of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>. The 19-year-old trainee from <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, drown March 2 in a training pool at <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. Marine Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>, one of the lawyers for the 28-year-old defendant from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, contended the prosecution, which rested Tuesday, had presented insufficient evidence to prove his client's guilt. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> helped other instructors toss <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the pool after the panicked recruit climbed out and tried to quit the voluntary training, and then forced the victim's head under water, prosecution witnesses have testified. <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> and other instructors adhered to what they considered normal procedures in dealing with an unwilling trainee. `` You can not have a conspiracy to commit what you believe to be a lawful act,'' <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> said. But the lead prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, argued the instructors' actions were illegal. On the involuntary manslaughter charge, <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> contended there was no culpable negligence because <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> did n't know <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia about being dragged under water and could n't have anticipated it would cause him to have a heart attack. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pathologist testified the phobia triggered fear-induced heart failure that led to his drowning. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> should have expected the possibility of death resulting from his actions because another recruit had passed out from similar treatment at <ORGANIZATION> Combe </ORGANIZATION>'s hands last year, <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> also argued that evidence failed to show <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was touched against his will, a necessary finding for a battery conviction. Witnesses had testified <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> shouted he wanted to quit and was trying to get away before <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> grabbed him in a head hold and dunked him.

 Primary victors <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> launched a campaign Wednesday for the seat of retiring Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> that promises to be the most expensive race in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> history. `` It's going to be like ` <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>'s Millions,''' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grebe </PERSON>, a Republican national committeeman, referring to the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> movie in which a man must give away a large amount of money in a short time. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team, defeated former Gov. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> and three other Democratic candidates Tuesday after spending $ 2.1 million, most of it on TV ads. He had raised $ 3.6 million for the primary, $ 3.2 million of it his own money. In the general election, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> `` will spend enough to get his message across, just as he did in the primary,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> credited his `` Nobody's Senator but Yours'' slogan for his victory and said the vote showed people wanted `` a qualified non-politician with real business world experience.'' <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, the only woman nominated by either party for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat this year, spent $ 1.2 million to defeat <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. King, former state party chairman, in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. She said she expects to spend $ 3.5 million in the general election, a shade over the state record of $ 3.4 million spent by Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> in his re-election campaign in 1986. Yet Engeleiter plans to make an issue of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s wealth, according to campaign manager <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, by portraying the choice as between a 36-year-old mother of two and a bachelor millionaire.

 A woman accused of setting up housekeeping in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s home while he was away, taking the talk show host's Porsche for a spin and posing as his wife was placed on two years' probation today. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 36, of no certain address, was granted accelerated rehabilitation on charges of burglary and auto theft. The form of probation is available to first-time offenders and does not require the defendant to enter a plea. If the defendant completes probation, the charges are stricken from his or her record. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to remain a psychiatric patient at <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> and have no personal contact with <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was twice found incompetent to stand trial on the charges. `` It's good news,'' she said after sentencing. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was taken into custody in May after she was stopped at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> entrance to the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> driving <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s sports car, police said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, whose 3-year-old son was in the car, did n't have any money and allegedly told the toll collector, `` I'm Mrs. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> and this is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Libya Able To Produce Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has evidence that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has acquired a chemical weapons production capability and is on the verge of a full-scale production effort. Department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> called this `` a particularly worrisome development'' in light of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s record of state-sponsored terrorism in many global troublespots. He said the kinds of chemicals that are useful in producing chemical weapons are available on the world market. He called on nations that may be making contributions to the Libyan program to halt such activity. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been investigating the matter for some time but substantiated the alleged Libyan activities only recently. He provided no information on type of weapons <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is developing nor did he say how <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials learned of the operations. His statement came less than a week after he accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels in defiance of a 1925 international protocol barring use of such weapons. He said Wednesday that the use of chemical weapons by both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had set a `` dangerous precedent'' for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as a whole. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> noted that there were reports last year that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had used chemical weapons in its war with <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. `` We also have the general record of irresponsible behavior on the part of -LRB- <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I think in the end this is yet another indication of why the world community needs to take vigorous action to curb the illicit use of chemical weapons and their further proliferation,'' he added.

 The government said Wednesday that three anti-apartheid leaders holed up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate after escaping detention are free men and will not be rearrested. But the lawyer for the trio, who were jailed up to 21 months without trial, said he received no official word of the government's stance and gave no indication what his clients planned to do. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the three were `` not in any danger of being arrested once they leave the consulate.'' Police said they would have to issue new orders to detain the men again but that they have no plans to do so. The activists slipped away from their police guards Tuesday while undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital and made their way to the consulate in a downtown office building. `` We sought refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> because we failed to see any justification for our continued detention without trial,'' the three said in the statement. `` We have now resorted to the only dignified response to our continued incarceration.'' The escapees are <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, acting publicity secretary of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, the front's acting general secretary, and <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION>, detained without trial since July 1987, and <LOCATION> Khanyile </LOCATION>, detained since December 1986, are black. <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, an Indian, was arrested with <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION>. The trio, in a statement released by their lawyer, <PERSON> Krish </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, called for an end to the 27-month state of emergency and demanded `` the right to walk out of this consulate free of any restrictions, or the threat of redetention.'' <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> said his clients had not received word of the government's offer. He said he did not know how the activists would respond if they received a formal offer of unconditional freedom. <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, who met with the men Wednesday, said they gave no indication that they want to leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The trio, who also met with family members, were staying in one small room, but they had a television, videocassette recorder and their own beds, <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Beyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Naude </PERSON>, a white anti-apartheid activist who also met the detainees, said, `` Their state of mind is positive and they are in good spirits.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> met for an hour Tuesday night with <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> and other members of a committee representing the activists. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, the first black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, conferred with the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, the black general secretary of the South African Council of Churches; <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, an Indian anti-apartheid labor leader; and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a white opponent of detention without trial. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> promised that the activists' material needs would be met while they were in the consulate. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the activists would not be forced to leave their sanctuary against their will despite a worldwide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not formally granting asylum in diplomatic offices. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the embassy remained in contact with the South African government about the situation. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying periods during the emergency, which the white-led government declared to control widespread black protests. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> thanked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday for pledging to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in back dues, but he said the world body still faces long-term fiscal problems. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced Tuesday he is releasing $ 188 million in dues for the current and next fiscal year. The White House told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to work out a `` multiyear'' plan to repay $ 520 million more in all overdue assessments to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget and to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, the second-ranking diplomat at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, will give the secretary-general a check for $ 15 million Wednesday afternoon as a first payment, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. `` Of course, it has been a tremendous relief for me,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We consider that it was a very positive development. I am grateful for the understanding of the president and his staff... But it is important to understand that we are not completely off the hook,'' said the secretary-general. When asked if the long efforts to persuade the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pay its dues sapped the time of his staff and detracted from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s peacekeeping activities, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> replied: `` All our activities have a price.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withheld part of its dues to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to trim its budget, cut the staff by 15 percent and adopt personnel reforms. The White House now says it is satisfied with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s progress in implementing the reforms. There are 102 delinquent nations owing the regular <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget $ 602 million. The outstanding delinquents are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at $ 467 million, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> $ 33.9 million, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> $ 17.9 million, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> $ 12.1 million, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> $ 9.8 million, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> $ 6.2 million, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> $ 6.2 million, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> $ 4.7 million, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> $ 4.3 million and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> $ 4 million. In addition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is about $ 70 million behind in assessed dues to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has a reserve budget of about $ 200 million to be used as seed money to start up peacekeeping operations and for other sudden commitments, but the organization had to dip into the fund to meet operating expenses. That fund would have been exhausted by the end of October without an infusion of money from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> unable to meet its payroll, rents and other fixed operating costs. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge to repay its dues may enable the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to borrow money from nations that had been reluctant to help take up the slack caused by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Building up the reserve fund is now a top priority because of the possibility that a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force of over 7,000 may be sent to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> after Nov. 1 to monitor that South African-ruled territory's transition to independence. The <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> operation may cost $ 600 million to $ 700 million, he said, far outstripping the $ 200 million reserve fund _ which is already near depletion. Other potentially costly <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping plans in the works are a referendum in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> on independence or affiliation with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, and a plan for a political settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Both settlements would require thousands of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers and election monitors.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Down, Reflecting Trend to Buy American</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit showed the biggest improvement in almost six years in July, a dramatic 28 percent narrowing that reflected a big decline in Americans' appetite for foreign goods, the government reported Wednesday The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the difference between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports and what it sells abroad shrank to $ 9.53 billion in July, down $ 3.6 billion from a June deficit of $ 13.22 billion. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lost no time hailing the huge decline as proof that the administration's economic strategy of fighting soaring trade deficits with a devaluation of the dollar was paying off. In a speech in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the trade figures `` very good'' news that proved that `` when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> goes into the market to compete, we play to win.'' The 28 percent June-to-July decrease was the biggest monthly improvement since a 35.7 percent narrowing in September 1982 and gave the country the lowest overall imbalance since December 1984, when the deficit was $ 8 billion. While the trade deficit has been showing improvement for most of this year, the gains have all been on the export side, reflecting the fact that the weaker dollar has made American products competitive once again on overseas markets. Imports, however, had remained at stubbornly high levels. Analysts said this made the July drop particularly encouraging. `` The big story is the tremendous improvement in imports, suggesting that Americans might finally be beginning to buy more American,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Imports are declining because we have finally found a price high enough to stop consumers from buying imported goods,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment firm. But other economists cautioned that it was far too early to determine whether the import drop was the beginning of a long-term trend. They noted that the decline to $ 35.99 billion was down from a record high level of $ 39.50 billion in June. `` I do n't think we have reached some kind of watershed where all of a sudden consumers have decided they no longer want to buy foreign goods,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. The July deficit was substantially better than economists had expected. The government did, however, boost the June deficit to $ 13.2 billion from the originally reported $ 12.5 billion. For the first seven months of this year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit has been running at an annual average of $ 137.5 billion, down 19.3 percent from the record $ 170.3 billion deficit suffered in 1987. This improvement has contributed more than half of total economic growth this year and economists expected further economic momentum from the trade performance in the second half of the year, good news for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential chances. In a second report Wednesday, the government said that industrial output rose a moderate 0.2 percent in August, pushing production up a healthy 5.3 percent over a year ago. Much of this gain reflects the boom in export sales that American companies have enjoyed. In July, exports climbed 0.7 percent to $ 26.5 billion, the fifth straight month they have exceeded $ 25 billion. The July improvement came from a variety of areas, led by a $ 600 million rise in sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactured products. The big drop in imports came primarily in capital goods for businesses, which fell by $ 1.2 billion to $ 8 billion. This category had risen sharply the previous month as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies had looked abroad for the equipment needed to expand their own production facilities. Also dropping sharply in July were car imports, which fell by $ 803 million with almost all of that decline coming from a drop in shipments of cars from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Financial markets, which over the past year have been thrown into a tailspin by unexpectedly bad monthly trade figures, gave a generally lukewarm response to the good news Thursday. Stock and bond prices and the dollar all posted modest gains. As usual, the country suffered its biggest deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a $ 4.4 billion imbalance, which was unchanged from June. The deficit with Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> rose to $ 2.3 billion from $ 1.9 billion in June. The deficits with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were unchanged at $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion, respectively. With the release of Wednesday's report, the government resumed a practice abandoned in 1979 of simultaneously reporting the import figures with the cost of shipping and insurance removed. Using this system, the deficit for July would have been an even lower $ 8.07 billion, down from a June imbalance, minus shipping and insurance, of $ 11.7 billion.

 Hispanics hold a record 3,360 elected offices across the country, most of them at the local level, the director of an organization that tracks Hispanic officials said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> has 11 Hispanic members and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has none, but <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pachon </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elected </ORGANIZATION> and Appointed Officials, said big gains are possible in 1992 when congressional districts are reapportioned based on the 1990 census. Although Hispanics make up 19.4 million, or 8 percent, of the country's population, they hold fewer than 1 percent of the 490,000 elected offices nationwide, <PERSON> Pachon </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference. <PERSON> Pachon </PERSON>, however, called the gains made by Hispanics into elected positions `` dramatic progress. It's not just rhetoric, it's an increasing reality.'' The number of Hispanics holding office increased 1.3 percent this year, less than the 4.2 percent increase logged in 1987. But that increase reflected the 1986 elections, while this year's figures largely reflect local elections held between August 1987 and this past August, <PERSON> Pachon </PERSON> said At the same time, the number of Hispanic women elected to office increased by 5.7 percent this year, to 626 or 18.6 percent of the total. <PERSON> Pachon </PERSON> said most of the elected Hispanics are Democrats, except in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where most are Republican. The association said the largest gains were made in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounting for a record-high 1,611 Hispanic officials. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has the nation's second largest Hispanic population, estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> at 4.1 million or 23.1 percent of the estimated nationwide total. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had the second-highest total with 595 Hispanic officials. Overall, the state has 543,000 Hispanics, or 2.8 percent of the national total. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has the largest Hispanic population in the country _ 6.6 million or 33.9 percent of the nationwide Hispanic population _ and 466 hold elective office. `` With 6 million Hispanics in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, you think there would be a half dozen -LRB- in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' instead of the current four, said Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Many <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Hispanics, however, are not eligible to vote, <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said, adding that the situation would change in the 21st century when their children can vote. `` All of these kids are going to vote and there is going to be a tremendous upsurge. The 21st century will make a tremendous difference,'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with a Hispanic population of 2.1 million, or 11 percent, had 68 elected Latino leaders, the report said, fewer than states with smaller Hispanic populations like <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, with 237 elected of officials, and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> with 157. The report said Hispanics hold one governorship, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and there are 229 Hispanic mayors, 120 state legislators, 319 county office holders, 1,106 municipal officials and 1,226 school board members. Other states with double-digit numbers of elected Hispanics were <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 50, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, 44, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 28, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, 15, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 12.

<HEAD>Koop Advocates Hospice Care For AIDS Patients</HEAD>

 Terminally ill AIDS patients should be treated in low-cost hospices rather than expensive hospitals, Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said Wednesday. Interviewed after an address to the 1,500 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said a move toward more hospice care would have to come from a public-private partnership between governments and private insurers. `` The public and private sectors have to get together. ... A frank discussion of what AIDS will cost, how insurance fits in, and the terminally ill needing a place to stay,'' he said. Thirty hospitals in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area recently reported a $ 1.6 million yearly loss from treating AIDS patients. Asked if hospitals were being shortchanged, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said there is a need to move patients from a high-technology setting to hospice care to save costs during the final stages of the disease. Hospices are homelike facilities that provide support for terminally ill patients. Medical care stresses relief of pain rather than efforts to prolong life. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said the stigma attached to AIDS has caused financial problems for hospitals partly because some patients, fearful others might think they have AIDS, have stayed away from institutions known for treating people with the disease. Some insurance companies do n't insure AIDS treatment and in areas where government has required them to, like the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the insurance companies leave town, he said. `` The public sector has provided enough money'' for AIDS care, he said. During his speech, the surgeon general reiterated his call for AIDS prevention through sexual abstinence, monogamy or condom use and warned that free-needle programs will not wipe out the deadly disease among intravenous drug abusers. He said camaraderie among drug abusers leads to the sharing of needles and the potential spread of AIDS. His two-hour speech and question-and-answer session to the Philadelphia-based insurance company was also beamed to cable subscribers nationwide, to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s public school students. From September 1987 to this month, 31,000 new cases of patients suffering from the symptoms of the disease have been diagnosed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. There have been 73,000 AIDS cases, 41,000 of whom have died, reported worldwide since 1981, he said. Depending on the prevalence of AIDS in the area, the chances of receiving a unit of blood infected with the virus are one in 40,000 to one in 250,000, he said. About 900 children have been born infected with the virus, he said. Asked if there was a danger from vials containing AIDS-infected blood washing up on beaches, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said exposure to salt water inhibits the virus' ability to grow in a bloodstream or in a laboratory. `` It's sort of icky to go swimming with a bunch of dirty bandages floating around, but it wo n't kill you,'' he said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most frequently spread though sexual contact with a partner infected with the virus or sharing intravenous drug needles.

<HEAD>Cook County Patients May Get To Refuse Treatment by AIDS Virus

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Patients at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> would have the right to refuse treatment by workers who carry the AIDS virus under a proposal praised by some in the medical community as an advance in patients' rights but criticized by others as misinformed. The recommendation was approved Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> It is expected to be endorsed by the full board next week, becoming the first such policy for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospital, officials said. It would cover all hospital workers who `` routinely provide direct patient care,'' including doctors and nurses. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the proposed policy is an effort to increase patients' rights, but others in the medical profession blasted the proposal Wednesday. `` Our reaction is one of dismay,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There has been no case in this country of a patient contracting the AIDS virus from a health-care worker. `` It is important to keep in mind that the disease is not transmitted by casual contact,'' <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of trustees, said from his <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, office `` The likelihood of transmission from a health-care worker is very small.'' The proposed policy `` is not offering -LRB- patients -RRB- any additional protection. It implies people should be worried,'' he said. `` This is a policy based on fear and it will do no one any good,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Renslow </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherer </PERSON>, who works in the AIDS prevention service at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` This is an ill-conceived and ill-advised policy.'' `` The fact that no other hospital has taken this action means the hospitals do n't see this as a major problem,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Guild </PERSON>, director of medical staff affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not supported by scientific evidence that something like this is necessary,'' <PERSON> Guild </PERSON> said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers. AIDS has struck more than 72,000 people in this country since 1979 and killed more than 40,000 of them, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is believed to be spread through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth. The resolution was passed by the committee over the objections of <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents doctors at the institution, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Women's AIDS Project and several other community organizations. Dr. <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> <PERSON> McCuiston </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the policy `` would wrongly give the impression that there is a high incidence of AIDS and HIV cases among County Hospital Workers.'' However, board member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroger </PERSON> said it is a case of a patient's right to know. `` Doctors at <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have told me they would n't let members of their families be treated by a certain doctor at the hospital -LRB- because they fear he has AIDS -RRB-, but then they turn around and come out for doctors' rights,'' <PERSON> Stroger </PERSON> said. Neurosurgeon <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouffard </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> doctor who died of AIDS-related diseases in May, was stripped of his medical privileges at the hospital in February 1987 by the county board, which cited concerns about the spread of the disease. A year later, a federal judge ordered him reinstated, but required him to wear double gloves for certain procedures.

 Residents of this celebrity enclave want a memorial to honor the memory of a not-so-rich or famous inhabitant _ a hermit known as <PERSON> Malibu </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> who spurned most offers of help. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, whose last name was believed to be either Castello or Costello, died Sept. 4, six days after he was found severely beaten and robbed. He was 96. He told police before he died that he could n't remember who had attacked him, and there have been no arrests. Flowers and cards have been placed around the tiny shrub-surrounded area behind a gas station that <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> called home. `` <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>'s devastated,'' said G.G. <PERSON> Gundry </PERSON>, a resident. `` If he'd died of old age, people would be sad but not as upset as they are now When someone is murdered like that, it makes you realize the world is changing.'' Actress <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGraw </PERSON> is among the locals who have joined i a drive to build a memorial. More than $ 1,400 has been raised toward installation of a bench and permanent plaque in his honor. <PERSON> Malibu </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s body is still at the coroner's office. Authorities say residents have expressed interest in paying for a funeral if no kin comes forward. `` There is a possibility we will have a memorial service at <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bluff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. We're trying to something together,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Malibu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malibu </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> refused handouts, leading local real estate agent <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> to once declare that if <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> ever incorporated, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> should be mayor because `` nobody can get to him _ if you try to give him even a dollar, he gets very upset.'' But <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> would occasionally accept items left at his spot. `` He was n't considered a transient or a bum by us.

 South African police killed three hijackers and arrested the fourth in a shootout Wednesday night that ended a hostage drama in which the gunmen seized a bus carrying 71 pilgrims headed to see the pope, South African officials said. One of the hostages, a young woman, was killed, and 11 passengers were injured, the officials said. The report of the shootout came from South African police headquarters. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s military government had requested South African help in handling the hijacking. Police said the shootout occurred when the hijackers tried to drive the bus through the closed gates of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>. The hijackers began shooting, and South African officers returned fire. Police said the casualties among the hostages were `` apparently caused by the wild firing of the hijackers.'' They said no policemen were injured. The shooting broke out about 20 minutes after Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>, eight hours behind schedule. The hijackers earlier had demanded to meet with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s king, <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a government official said. After nightfall, gunfire was heard at the site where the bus was parked, and flares lit up the sky. Reporters were blocked from getting close enough to the scene to determine what was happening but saw ambulances take bloodied bodies, one of them a nun, to a hospital. Police ordered journalists at the scene to disperse and then chased them away with whips. The bus was hijacked Tuesday night en route to <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>. Earlier Wednesday, bad weather forced the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s plane to land in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where he met Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> at the airport and was briefed about the hijacking. The pope then journeyed overland to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. Before the shootout, helicopters and armed cars blanketed central <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION> as 100 armed soldiers and police set up roadblocks and kept spectators at least four blocks from the bus, parked outside the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. One man escaped earlier today from the bus, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thabane </PERSON>, secretary for <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s six-man military council. <PERSON> Thabane </PERSON> said the hijackers were members of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had been opposed to the leftist government of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Leabua </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>. A number of bombings and killings were attributed to the group, which reportedly had South African backing.

<HEAD>Soldier Denies Security Chief Ordered IRA Members Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of four British soldiers who shot and killed three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in March denied Wednesday that his commander sent the anti-terrorist unit to eliminate the guerrillas. He testified before a court investigating whether members of the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> were justified in killing the guerrillas, who the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged were on a mission in this British colony. `` Our only intention was to arrest -LRB- them -RRB-,'' said `` soldier B,'' hidden from public view by a curtain for security reasons. A senior British intelligence officer has testified at the inquest that the soldiers believed the three were armed and were planning to set off a car bomb during a changing of the guard ceremony. `` -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members' -RRB- movements precipitated our action,'' he said. `` I believe with the information we were given, we did the correct thing.'' The officer testified on the seventh day of an inquest by <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzarello </PERSON> and an 11-member jury into the March 6 shooting deaths of <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 31. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrory </PERSON>, the attorney for the families of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members, suggested to soldier B that their tactical commander, identified only as `` soldier E,'' sent them out on the anti-terrorist mission `` with the impression that the suspects were too dangerous to be allowed to live.'' During questioning, the <PERSON> McRory </PERSON> challenged soldier B: `` You were told to go out and kill -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members -RRB- and the task was made so plain to you that you feared no legal retribution for your actions.'' `` No,'' the soldier responded. The three guerrillas proved to be unarmed when the soldiers opened fire on them near a gas station in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. Critics of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government cited the shootings as evidence that her government is implementing an unofficial `` shoot-to-kill'' policy against <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members believed to be on missions to attack British targets. Spanish police found a car linked to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and loaded with 141 pounds of explosives and a timing device in the Spanish resort of <LOCATION> Marbella </LOCATION> two days after the shooting. The inquest has no power of prosecution against the seven men who formed the unit that took part in the operation against the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members. If the jury hands down a verdict of unlawful killing, the <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> attorney general is expected to return criminal indictments. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to oust the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and to unite the province with the mostly Catholic republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In another incident on Wednesday, police arrested a British man when he tried to enter <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in a van with British license plates. Chief Inspector <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Viagas </PERSON> said the man, accompanied by a woman, a teen-ager and a child, was arrested after customs officials searched his white <PERSON> Leyland </PERSON> van and found a .22 caliber pistol, six rounds of ammunition and 16 canisters believed to hold tear gas and a gas gun, <PERSON> Viagas </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production rose a modest 0.2 percent in August, the smallest gain in five months, following a much larger July advance, the government said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the increase in August, the 11th consecutive month without a decline, followed a revised 1 percent July advance, which had been the strongest showing since last October. The August increase was in line with expectations and analysts said it should calm fears that the economy was overheating. With factories operating at their highest levels in eight years, there had been fears that rising demand pressures would spark an inflationary spiral. But since late March, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and economists said this strategy is working. `` The fears of overheating are dying down,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, consulting firm. `` We are not looking for a recession, but we are getting fairly clear evidence that the economy is slowing down.'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> predicted that the overall economy, which expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the first half of the year, as measured by the gross national product, should grow at about that rate in the current July-September quarter, but then begin slowing in the final three months of 1988. The August increase in industrial production, the smallest since an identical 0.2 percent March advance, pushed output at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities up by 5.3 percent over the level of a year ago. `` Manufacturing continued to grow but just did so more slowly, coming on the heels of the big July advance,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The manufacturing sector was in good health over the summer.'' The report showed that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> producers were continuing to benefit from record high demand for their goods overseas. In a separate report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the country's merchandise trade deficit narrowed dramatically in July to a $ 9.5 billion gap as a small increase in exports and a big drop in imports gave the country its smallest trade imbalance since December 1984. Manufacturing companies saw their output advance by 0.2 percent following a 0.9 percent July increase. Output at plants making durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, rose by 0.2 percent, while factories making non-durable goods had a 0.1 percent increase. Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7 million units in August, down slightly from July, but production of light trucks showed an increase. Production of business equipment, which has been strong all year, rose 0.2 percent in August and now stands 9.7 percent higher than a year ago. Analysts said this reflected a big investment push on the part of companies buying computers and other capital equipment. Production in the mining sector fell by 0.3 percent as coal production declined after a huge increase in July. The nation's utilities boosted production by 2.1 percent in August, reflecting a continuation of the summer heat wave. The various changes left industrial output at 138.2 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Will Go Along With Ban on Big Bank-Securities Mergers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday he sees no need for a blanket ban on mergers of the biggest banks and securities firms, but will go along with such a ban to win passage of legislation permitting banks to underwrite securities. Bills passed by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would permit bank holding companies to underwrite many securities. But both bills, in provisions aimed at blocking the creation of financial giants, forbid the merger of the 15 largest securities firms with the 15 largest banking companies. However, Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is reviewing the bill, said he may offer an amendment to bring the bill in line with antitrust law, which focuses on the power of merged firms in specific regional or product markets. Rep. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, ranking minority member on the Judiciary subcommittee on monopolies, said the largest banks and securities firms currently represent little more than 1 percent of their current markets. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told subcommittee members that he and fellow <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governors `` see no threat to the system if those -LRB- merger -RRB- activities were to take place.'' But he said they did not believe it was wise to press the issue for fear of hurting chances for repealing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial from investment banking in 1933. He also said he thought such large mergers unlikely. Large banks are more likely to purchase several small securities firms or start up a securities division on their own, he said. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is strongly in favor of merger limits However, Comptroller of the Currency <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, whose office regulates nationally chartered banks, said `` arbitrary prohibition on certain mergers is not ... appropriate.'' He urged the subcommittee to strike the size limits from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill and allow regulators to judge each merger individually for its effect on competition. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> branded a number of other provisions in the House bill as anti-competitive, including: a ban on corporate stock underwriting; the prohibition of banks and securities affiliates from sharing corporate names, logos, premises or advertising, and a restriction on banks ability to sell insurance.

<HEAD>Hodel Won't Force Park Service to Change Fire-fighting Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said Wednesday he wo n't force the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to change its fire-fighting policy, but he repeated his belief that the `` let it burn'' policy had been a failure and predicted modifications will be made before the next fire season. `` I think we'll just have to see what they come up with as a recommendation,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said in an interview, referring to the policy review just getting under way by the service in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies. `` I'm not planning to impose a policy.'' Comments by environmentalists and others that the `` let it burn'' policy had succeeded were `` a backfire'' by people who fear changes, he said. `` Let it burn'' is how the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> unofficially described its practice since 1972 of letting most naturally caused fires burn themselves out for the benefits they bring to forest regeneration. The policy called for fighting fires that threatened human settlement and property, significant park structures and resources, and all fires started by humans. On July 21, pressed by the worst fire season in 300 or 400 years in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the West, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decided to fight all fires because it could not be sure than any one would not get out of control. It extended that `` suppression'' policy to all its parks in August. The service has argued that the buildup of dead trees and other fuel from the 100 years of suppressing all fires before 1972 could not be burned off in the 16 years since then, and that buildup made this year's fires far worse than they should have been, resulting in fire over nearly half of the park in blazes that could not have been put out no matter when they were attacked. Some environmental groups have argued that the policy worked and should be supported, and that no one could have predicted the severity of the drought or the fires. Leaders of these supporting groups usually add that people living around <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> _ the most vigorous critics of the policy _ deserve some help for the damage done to their businesses by the decline in tourism. `` I do n't think the majority of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people would say this policy has worked and I would say the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are right,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. Asked to define a successful policy, the secretary replied: `` I'd rather define what is not successful. A policy is not successful if the result'' subjects communities in and near the park `` to extreme jeopardy and evacuations because you did n't know if you were going to be able to control the fires,'' as happened this year. He said he believed the Park Service policy change July 21 had happened `` fairly quickly'' in the light of available information. Asked whether that change was made quickly enough, he responded, `` I'm not going to engage in that kind of thing because the Monday morning quarterback never gets sacked.'' Noting that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, had admitted that in hindsight they would have fought every fire from the beginning, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said he thought <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials were not satisfied with the results of the `` let it burn'' policy either. Asked if he were trying to satisfy both critics of the service as well as the service and its supporters, he replied: `` No. I'm trying to be responsive to the best professional and technical advice.

 Cold, damp weather retarded blazes and chilled firefighters at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, and firefighters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> worked Wednesday to put out hot spots and make <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rush </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where nearly 100 homes burned, `` wind-proof.'' But experts cautioned that the West's worst fire season in decades was n't necessarily over yet. The fires that have devastated nearly a million acres of the nation's oldest national park have grown together to form a single blaze, but cold, wet weather has helped firefighters, officials said. `` It's been so cold out there the firefighters are coming in to get warm, and that's really good if they ca n't stay warm fighting a fire,'' said <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>, a fire commander at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, where temperatures had dipped as low as the upper 20s overnight. Elsewhere, firefighters worked to complete lines around a stubborn blaze in Glacier National Park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where afternoon temperatures climbed into the 70s but winds stayed relatively calm. Army reinforcements began arriving Wednesday for a final assault on the giant <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> fire in west-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Fires also continued in several other Western states, including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where firefighters Wednesday took advantage of calm weather to dig more lines around a blaze in Olympic National Park. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> confirmed Wednesday that the forest service's widely criticized policy of letting naturally caused fires burn was being revised. The fires resulting from the drought of 1988, which have charred more than 4 million acres, show that the policy `` just does n't make sense,'' he said in a television interview. About 30,000 firefighters continued to battle 32 fires in eight Western states, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. In northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, officials of the state forestry department said they were making plans to start sending firefighters back to their home stations, although the first significant pullout probably would n't take place until Thursday. The sudden brushfire that destroyed nearly 100 homes Sunday and Monday ebbed almost as rapidly as it had spread, and all but a few of an estimated 8,000 people who had been evacuated at one time or another had returned home by Wednesday. `` The top priority today is to pick up all the remaining hot spots that are left. We want to be wind-proof,'' fire operations chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> said, noting that stiffer winds are expected again in the <LOCATION> Sierras </LOCATION> beginning Friday. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, low overnight temperatures forced humidity up to almost 100 percent at times, <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said Wednesday morning. `` The weather has really knocked this down,'' he said. `` So unless the weather changes drastically, we're definitely in the mop-up stage.'' Although forecasts called for warmer, drier weather, the high winds that last week allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres each day were not expected. But <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> stressed that the fires have surprised firefighters in the past. He would not call the blazes controlled or contained. `` This is ... tricky,'' he said. All the fires in the park have burned into one another, <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said, in essence creating one fire stretching from the park's southern end to its northeastern corner In all, fires in the greater <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area covered about 1.5 million acres, including land in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and have cost more than $ 100 million to fight. With clouds that have covered the park since Sunday breaking up Wednesday morning, fire officials prepared for warmer weather that would let them see how well fire lines that have been built Sunday would hold up, said park spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Iobst </PERSON>. `` As long as things do n't get crazy here again, a lot of progress can be made by people on the ground,'' he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> southeast of the park, officials said firefighters had contained 90 percent of the 225,500-acre Huck-Mink fire complex and estimated they would control the 38,500-acre Fayette fire by Friday. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, Grand Teton National Park assistant chief ranger, said officials have started releasing firefighters from both fires.

 A man claiming he wanted to promote peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> held 11 people at gunpoint at a military recruiting center Wednesday before releasing them unharmed and surrendering. The gunman, identified as <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eloud </PERSON>, 20, of suburban <LOCATION> Henrico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was being held at county police headquarters on 11 counts of abduction and 11 counts of use of a firearm in commission of a felony, authorities said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eloud </PERSON> described himself to police during telephone negotiations as being of Lebanese descent and said he had two armed companions. The gunman began releasing his captives after two local radio stations broadcast a statement, but his goal was not immediately clear and he made no specific threats, said Sands. Slight and wearing a yellow T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, <PERSON> Eloud </PERSON> walked out of the center about 10 minutes after his last hostage, placed an AK-47 and what looked like ammunition clips on the ground, then went back inside and emerged with a pistol, which he also laid on the ground. He placed his hands on top of his head as directed by police officers, who handcuffed him and led him away. The gunman seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruiting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about 9:15 a.m, taking hostage nine military personnel and two civilians. A Marine recruiter reporting for work about 9:30 a.m. spotted the gunman through the front window and went to an adjacent store to call police, said police Lt. <PERSON> C.M </PERSON>. Schesventer. The gunman also telephoned police and remained in contact with a negotiator for the next 4 -LCB- hours. He released the first hostages, a female civilian and a high school senior enlisting in the service, about 12:15 p.m. and gradually sent out the rest before surrendering about 1:50 p.m. There were no injuries and no shots were fired, <PERSON> Schesventer </PERSON> said. Authorities declined to give the hostages' names. The recruiting station is in a strip shopping center on a heavily developed commercial street running into suburban <LOCATION> Henrico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. Authorities evacuated the stores and cleared the parking lot as about 30 police vehicles cordoned off the area. Flak-jacketed police carrying automatic weapons and shotguns took up positions in the lot and on nearby rooftops. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> stations WRNL-AM and WRXL-FM went along with a <LOCATION> Henrico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> request to air a brief statement. It was read two times about noon, when authorities still believed the gunman had accomplices. `` There is a hostage situation at Tuckernuck Square Shopping Center,'' the statement said. `` There have been no injuries. Negotiations are proceeding. The hostage-takers have so far been cooperative. They're holding an undetermined number of people. The hostage-takers' goal is peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been racked by sectarian fighting since 1975. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement condemning the action, which it called a `` senseless act of terrorism.'' `` We fervently hope that this isolated instance of violence will not fan the flames of anti-Arab sentiment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the statement from committee President <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>. `` Terrorism never has been and never will be an acceptable solution to the very real anguish and suffering of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people.''

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> suspended three <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> employees and censured three others Thursday for negligently operating what he told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was an `` unnecessarily broad'' terrorism probe into a group opposing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policies All those disciplined were lower - and mid-level employees The suspensions were for 14 days without pay. Sessions said top-level officials had been unaware the bureau was collecting information `` on rank-and-file members'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> who he said had `` nothing to do with international terrorism.'' Sessions said there is no evidence that the White House or any other government agency or outside private group attempted to influence the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe. The investigation took place between March 1983 and June 1985 when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director. Sessions became <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> head last November, after <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was named <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. Sessions, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, vowed to institute changes that would keep top bureau officials fully apprised of sensitive terrorism investigations that might impinge on constitutional rights. The <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe began in March 1983 based largely on information from a now-discredited informant in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>, alleging the group was supplying financial support to two terrorist organizations and preparing for terrorist activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Varelli's background was not checked, he was not properly and thoroughly reviewed and there was just negligence all the way along the line,'' Sessions told the committee. Sessions said that without the <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> claims of terrorist activity, there would have been an insufficient basis to investigate <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>. Committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., suggested that much of <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>'s information came from unproven allegations published in a right-wing magazine in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Sessions disciplined a supervisor and former assistant special agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office and a supervisor in another unspecified bureau, along with a field supervisor, unit chief and section chief at bureau headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. All six were given written reprimands and three of them were placed on probation and suspended from duty without pay for 14 calendar days. He did not give their names. Sources familiar with the action by Sessions identified three of those being disciplined as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Balen </PERSON>, chief of the international terrorism-global unit at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, a supervisory special agent in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters; and <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION>, a supervisory special agent in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. A seventh employee, `` whose performance would in all likelihood would have merited dismissal,'' said Sessions, has resigned. That was an apparent reference to <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>'s handler who quit in 1984, after acknowledging he had given classified documents from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files to <LOCATION> Varelli </LOCATION> and failed to pass along money that was to have been paid to the informer. `` The major turning point'' in the probe came when it was `` unnecessarily broadened'' in October 1983 to becme nationwide scope, Sessions testified. `` It remained unnecessarily broad thereafter.'' `` There was no reason to believe that all CISPES members nationwide knew of or had any involvement in support of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terrorists,'' testified Sessions. The decision to widen the investigation `` was made at a comparatively low level and ... supervisory personnel at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters who should have reviewed and analyzed this decision and appreciated its significance failed to do so.'' The investigation involved all the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s bureaus, encompassed 180 <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> chapters across the country and spawned 178 spinoff investigations, including probes of nine groups and the remainder probes of individuals, he said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents photographed protesters at peace rallies, recorded license plate numbers and investigated nuns, union members and college students. The <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe involved surveillance, undercover attendance at meetings, interviews with organization members and checks of telephone and utility company records and records of license and credit bureaus, as well as law enforcement agency record checks. Sessions said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> inspectors who investigated the handling of the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe found 31 instances where agents may have violated the attorney general's guidelines for carrying out international terrorism probes. He said 15 of them were subsequently found to be violations, including 13 deemed serious enough to be reported to the President's Intelligence Oversight Board. But the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation `` does not reflect a policy of purposeful interference with legitimate domestic political activity,'' he said. The probe was closed in June 1985 after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded the group was involved in political activities protected by the First Amendment and not involved in terrorism. <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>'s information was deemed unreliable approximately one year into the investigation, yet it continued for another year and when <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> asked why, <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said: `` There were other informants, there was still the suggestion that there would be disruptions'' by <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1984. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said the center will file a lawsuit if the bureau does n't expunge the names of those investigated The center obtained <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents early this year disclosing the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> told a news conference after the hearing that the disciplined <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> personnel should have been fired, adding that the `` level and amount of punishment'' should have been more severe. `` What we see here is only smoke,'' said <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived in this tiny kingdom Wednesday just 20 minutes before a bloody shootout between police and gunmen holding a busload of nuns and children on a papal pilgrimage. Four people reportedly died. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was to fly from <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> today but bad weather forced his chartered jet to make an unscheduled landing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the target of his criticism during his southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> tour. The pope arrived in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> eight hours behind schedule and just 20 minutes before the tense hostage drama was played out. Police said gunmen hijacked the bus carrying with about 70 people Tuesday, drove it to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, or embassy, compound and demanded to meet the pope. Authorities said the hijackers began firing after they tried to drive the vehicle through the closed gates of the embassy compound. Three hijackers and a hostage, a young woman, were killed in a gun battle with police, authorities said. Eleven other passengers were wounded, the rest of the hostages were rescued, and one hijacker was arrested, police said. The hijackers held police at bay through Tuesday night while demanding to meet <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s king, <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a government official said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, meanwhile, had intended to bypass <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on his tour of five neighboring, black-ruled nations. But his flight from <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> was diverted because of bad weather, and he spent three hours at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s Jan Smuts Airport before heading overland in a police-escorted convoy to rain-soaked <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, about 270 miles away. Members of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s military council greeted the pontiff at the border, but crowds along the route into <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION> were sparse because of the wet, chilly weather. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> did not kiss the ground in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, as he customarily does the first time he visits a country, and made no public statements there. He conferred privately with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it sent special police units into <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, at the government's request, to assist if necessary in dealing with the hijackers. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> is surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>, pilot of the pope's chartered <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707, earlier circled over <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s capital, for 30 minutes before deciding to divert the flight because of low clouds and malfunctioning radio beacons at the airport. The pope's spokesman, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was reading a book of philosophy when he was told of the problem, looked up, and said: `` This was not on the schedule.'' At <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smuts </PERSON>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> greeted the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and accompanied him into a VIP lounge while security forces deployed inside and outside the terminal. `` We consider it a privilege to assist the Holy Father,'' said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who ordered 100 meals and several bottles of wine for the entourage and had lunch with the pope. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he briefed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on the hijacking and discussed the political situation in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. South Africans were deeply involved in logistical arrangements for the papal visit to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> had been expected to cross the border to see the pope during his scheduled 48-hour visit, but the bad weather sharply reduced the flow of arrivals and huge tent villages set up to accommodate pilgrims were virtually empty. A hard, freezing rain fell as King <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> and other officials waited at the airport for hours before the announcement that the pope would come by road. Rain normally is considered a sign of good luck in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, but officials said the downpour was a disaster, disrupting the pope's schedule and wrecking entrepreneurs' hopes of profiting from the expected large crowds <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> was to be the third stop on a 10-day trip also taking the pontiff to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The aborted flight began in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has said the pope was advised by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops that this was not an appropriate time for him to visit their racially divided nation <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops have been active in the anti-apartheid movement, particularly since 17 major black opposition groups were banned in February. The white-controlled government has blamed the bishops for the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s decision to omit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from his official itinerary. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it erred in giving out a telephone number for people to call offering comments on a proposal to allow a mixture of salvaged meat and bone in hotdogs without stating the ingredients on labels. A terse `` correction'' notice by the department's information office said that all comments should be submitted in writing by Nov. 8. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> press chief, said agency officials were `` not prepared to take oral comments, so they'll have to be in writing.'' The proposal was announced by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. It would allow processors to include a mixture of salvaged meat, including small bits of bone, to be used in up to 10 percent of the meat content of hotdogs and similar items without showing the ingredients on product labels. The salvaged product, designated as MS -LRB- S -RRB-, or mechanically separated -LRB- species, such as pork or beef -RRB-, is made by grinding up ribs, neckbones and other hard-to-carve parts of slaughtered animals and forcing the mixture through sieves. Most of the bone particles are screened out, but some _ about the size of ground pepper flakes _ remain in the mixture. Current regulations permit the MS -LRB- S -RRB- to comprise up to 20 percent of the meat portion of hotdogs, bologna and other sausages, but the labels must state the contents. Processors, who asked for the exemption from the labeling rule, said they ca n't sell consumers on the idea of having such a mixture in hotdogs under the present labeling requirement. The written comments can be sent by Nov. 8 to: Policy Office, Attn: <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, Hearing Clerk, <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, Room 3171-S, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20250.

<BYLINE>GM, Ford Warn Stricter Fuel Economy Standards Would Cost Jobs</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Failure to loosen fuel economy standards for 1989 and 1990 cars will cost American jobs and may drive carbuyers into the showrooms of foreign manufacturers, the nation's two largest automakers said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, at a public hearing, urged the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to keep the mandatory fuel economy level from reverting to 27.5 miles per gallon in October. Both <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said they could not produce a mix of cars that would have a corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, at that level. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the third large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, projected it will meet or exceed a 27.5 mpg standard next year and did not speak at the hearing. The standard has been set at 26 mpg since 1986 under an exception allowed by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. The fuel-economy law, adopted in 1975 to reduce imported petroleum consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices, sets a maximum level of fuel consumption each automaker's fleet of passenger cars, on average, must meet. `` Ford's inability to meet the 27.5 mpg CAFE standard for 1989 and 1990 is not because of lack of effort, but instead is because of substantial market and economic changes,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Buist </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s director of automotive emissions and fuel economy. With gasoline prices averaging below $ 1 a gallon, larger cars are selling well as consumers look for luxury and performance rather than concentrating on mileage, <PERSON> Buist </PERSON> said. The corporate average fuel economy is calculated on the basis of sales, and public demand for less fuel efficient large cars drives the average up, the automakers said. `` Overly stringent CAFE standards restrict domestic production of larger cars and higher performance engines,'' <PERSON> Buist </PERSON> said. `` Foreign manufacturers, in particular the Japanese, are ready and willing to meet this consumer demand with vehicles built or sourced predominately in foreign countries. This could result in the loss of thousands of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs without any appreciable fuel economy savings.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> presented <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> with 5,000 letters from employees of and retirees from its <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, assembly plant, their families and labor leaders urging him to lower the CAFE standard to 26.5 mpg. A 27.5 mpg standard would force cutbacks in big-car production, resulting in layoffs in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> and elsewhere that would cost <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and its suppliers 60,000 jobs in 1989 and 110,000 jobs in 1990, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimisch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental activities executive director. <PERSON> Klimisch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has lost in its share of the market because `` we've gone too far with CAFE.'' `` It does n't do any good to put in new technology if you ca n't sell the cars,'' <PERSON> Klimisch </PERSON> said Opponents of looser standards urged <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> to raise the fuel-economy requirement to 27.5 mpg as the agency has proposed. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group, said if the standards were relaxed, `` the domestic manufacturers would virtually become importers of everything but large cars, given the projected worldwide glut of auto production capacity.'' The result, he said, would be the export of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs. The center proposed raising the standard to 55 mpg by the turn of the century, beginning at 30 mpg in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to issue a rule on the 1989 and 1990 standards within weeks. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its 1988 average fleet mileage would be 27.5 mpg or 27.6 mpg. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> projected average fuel economy of 26.5 mpg this year, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its cars would average 28.5 mpg.

<HEAD>Opposition Demands Answers After Expulsion Of Cuban Envoys</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders on Wednesday demanded an explanation of a mysterious shooting incident that led to the swift expulsion of the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ambassador and a junior envoy, who allegedly fired on a British security team. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> remains mute in the face of allegations and counter-allegations about a cloak-and-dagger intrigue which makes <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> read like a railway timetable,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs spokesman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON> The abrupt expulsion of the two diplomats and the government's refusal to comment on a host of allegations triggered charges that officials were trying to cover up an intelligence operation <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON> urged Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to explain `` the secret spider's web of espionage'' and the extent of involvement by MI5, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s counter-espionage agency. The Foreign Office stuck to its position that Third Secretary <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> behaved improperly by opening fire Monday afternoon in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> street, and said the circumstances behind the shooting were irrelevant. Both <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> and Cuban Ambassador <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Mell </PERSON> were expelled and left Tuesday. British government sources acknowledged Tuesday that <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> was being trailed by `` security agents.'' Officially, authorities said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> fired at a group of three men and a woman, slightly wounding one man. Police have interviewed the wounded man but refused to identify him and say the case is closed. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s communist government said one of the men allegedly trailing <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Azpillaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat who they say defected to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is working with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> said he was trying to force <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> to defect. Reaction in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was uniformly harsh. `` <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard amazed the world by saying that the case is closed before being opened,'' said an editorial in the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION>, which was broadcast by radio and monitored in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It is not a surprise because what happened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was one of the more calamitous joint operations of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' it added. The editorial charged the British government, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> `` have been caught with their hands in the cookie jar.'' The affair highlighted what former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said was routine surveillance of communist diplomats suspected of spying. `` The more I hear about this Cuban so-called diplomat, the more likely I think it is that he was under surveillance, and quite rightly so,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, foreign secretary in a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government before Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won power in 1979. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> added that an attempt to get <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> to defect would be `` not uncommon.'' `` There's nothing wrong with that ... the fundamental issue is that we're not having people opening fire in the streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and than claiming -LRB- diplomatic -RRB- immunity,'' he said.

 Utilities that contracted with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> purposely misled bond buyers about the need for two nuclear power plants and never intended to make good on their $ 2.25 billion bond debts, a lawyer argued Wednesday. Official statements made to entice investors to buy <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bonds contained `` a number of false promises,'' attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said in the plaintiffs' opening statement. He represents <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which has sued on behalf of 24,000 bond buyers. `` We claim, and we will prove that these false statements were made fraudulently ... and negligently,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. The defendants deny the claims of fraud, saying poor judgment may have been used, but that <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> and defendant utilities hired expert advisers and acted in what they believed were the best interests of power consumers in the Northwest. Twenty people were selected last week to serve as jurors in the huge, complex case. The trial, moved here from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state because of pretrial publicity, was expected to take months. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1957 by public utilities to build and operate major electric plants in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. In the 1970s, it embarked on an ambitious plan to build five nuclear power plants, but was plagued by cost overruns and construction delays. Only one plant was completed and is operating. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold for the fourth and fifth of those plants, leaving thousands of bond buyers holding worthless paper and spurring a host of lawsuits. The default was the biggest in the history of the municipal bond market. The two nuclear plants were never completed. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said the 16 defendant utilities, which are <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> directors, claimed there was a need for more electricity in the Northwest when there was not. They also repeatedly changed cost estimates for the plants, he said. The first of 14 bond sales estimated that the two plants would cost $ 3.37 billion, he said. That was in June 1977. In May 1981, <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said, the estimate had jumped to $ 11.8 billion, and the dates for plant completion had jumped several years. The ultimate `` ace up their sleeve,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said of the utilities, was the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state court system. `` They intended first to go to court to try to get their state courts to get them out of their promises,'' he said, adding that it worked. The default occurred after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled the 88 utilities participating in construction of the two plants had signed illegal contracts. Besides the 16 utilities with special ties to the supply system, remaining defendants include two engineering firms and an adviser to <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>. Seven other utilities settled out of court with the plaintiffs.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> bluntly warned the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' foreign secretary on Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared _ if pushed _ to move its military bases from that island nation, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials. The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> went out of his way during a closed-door meeting with Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> to stress <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s support for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government and President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, troubled by an impasse over the future of the <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not bluffing over the issue of monetary compensation `` and that there are other alternatives which have been found to be militarily and economically feasible,'' said one source. `` The secretary told him we understand the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' financial problems,'' the official continued, `` but that there are limits for us, too `` We are pretty well stretched to the edge of our limits here. There is very little flexibility left. And <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told him that while it would be extremely unfortunate for both countries, we are prepared to look elsewhere.'' The sources characterized the discussions at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as designed to reinforce a message delivered earlier this week by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> by stressing for the first time the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` really is prepared to move those bases if it has to.'' `` We do n't want to, but we will and more importantly, can,'' added one official. The sources said the leading candidate selected by military planners and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> as an alternative for the bases is <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, an island that is farther away from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> but which offers the advantage of being a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> came to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday for one-on-one talks with <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> after consulting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Tuesday. Following his visit to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he told reporters: `` There has been nothing to justify my saying that we are closer together.'' The major issue in the talks is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compensation to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for use of the bases. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has declined to provide details of the aid figures being discussed, but congressional sources and reports in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> indicate he is asking for about $ 1.2 billion annually over the next two years. This would represent a sizeable increase over the $ 180 million a year to which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been committed since 1983. In addition to cash aid, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> also is said to be seeking trade concessions, debt relief and other `` soft components,'' as <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> described them. The administration reportedly has offered $ 360 million yearly in 1989 and 1990 in addition to food assistance and other concessions for a total of just under $ 500 million. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said last week the Filipino demands were `` out of bounds,'' adding that `` we will be patient and we will be persistent'' in efforts to overcome the impasse. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has argued a substantial aid increase is warranted partly to correct what he suggests is an historical injustice, contending the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used military facilities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for more than 70 years without compensating Filipino authorities. In other countries, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided aid immediately after establishing military bases.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-8 on Wednesday to insist that former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> comply with a subpoena it issued five months ago demanding that he produce hundreds of pages of classified diary pages. The documents are sought by a Foreign Relations subcommittee investigating international narcotics trafficking. North and his attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, have resisted producing the diaries which <PERSON> North </PERSON> maintained as an official on the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He was fired from that job amid disclosures he had been involved in the secret sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and in the diversion of part of the proceeds to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, sought the subpoena after noticing heavily censored references to narcotics in copies of the diaries obtained by the congressional Iran-Contra committees He said they were relevant to his panel's investigation because of references to narcotics, to apparent links to the Contras and to the investigation itself. The full committee issued the subpoena last April 26 on a 17-1 vote. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said the committee had met some of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s objections, narrowing the scope of the subpoena to sections of the diaries containing references relevant to the subcommittee's probe and not insisting on receiving all 2,048 pages. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, continued to object to the decision to pursue the subpoena, saying it was unfair when <PERSON> North </PERSON> is facing trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here on charges growing out of the Iran-Contra affair. Some senators expressed doubt that the committee can obtain the subpoenaed documents by the time the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next month. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, urging his colleagues not to accept further delay, referred to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and said: `` Delay plays into the hands of a very clever counselor and plays into the hands of those who want to see all of this disappear.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have a `` soup-kitchen workforce'' unable to take part in the technological job market of the future unless it upgrades the critical skills of at least 12 million at-risk youth, according to reports released Wednesday. `` If we do n't -LRB- upgrade their skills -RRB- we will continue to increase the polarization between those at low income levels and those at the high income levels,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>.

Although each report pinpointed a particular aspect of programs designed to help youth overcome these social and economic problems, all agreed that the problem of ill-prepared youth was one that would come back to haunt the nation. <PERSON> Shioghan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolau </PERSON>, president of the Hispanic Policy Development Project in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, called for a fundamental restructuring of middle and secondary schools to emphasize job skills and responsibility early on.

<HEAD>Anti-Drug Effort Still Beset By Bureaucratic Infighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bureaucratic infighting means the administrative system being set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to oversee the federal government's anti-drug effort wo n't be the centralized operation sought by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a congressional watchdog agency said Wednesday. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> led two key senators to question whether the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> should spend any more money on the system. Customs has already spent $ 42 million and is seeking another $ 8 million. Six federal agencies have a role in the federal government's increasing efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Two years ago, as part of an anti-drug bill, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to develop a centralized command-and-control system to improve coordination among federal agencies. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> now operate separate facilities along the southern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border for overseeing planes and ships used to track drug traffickers. But the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> have both dropped out of the wide-ranging system originally envisioned by the 1986 law, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted, meaning the intent of the legislation may not be fulfilled. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report also noted that there are increasing congressional demands to make the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the chief coordination agency in the anti-drug effort, which would mean the Customs program would be outdated. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study raises serious questions regarding the adequacy of the Customs program and whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should continue to fund it. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report highlights a series of concerns raised by a number of senators that the Customs project has been fatally flawed from its inception,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We were led to believe that this command and control system would coordinate, not complicate, our drug programs We're throwing fuel on a fire that is out of control if we barge ahead with this system.'' Customs officials did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. But the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report quoted Customs officials as agreeing with the study's conclusions.

<HEAD>Bureau Signs Contract On Management Of Trust Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> signed a contract Wednesday to turn over management of $ 1.8 billion in trust funds to private management for the first time. The new manager, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, will take over accounting, receipt and disbursement of funds for 300,000 separate accounts from the bureau and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. The contract runs for a year, but may be renewed annually four times. If the bank remains manager for five years, it will be paid $ 21.2 million. The government would pay about $ 1 million to convert its accounting system to the bank's specifications, which will take about a year. To keep on managing the accounts in-house would cost the government $ 25 million over the same period, said bureau spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` Where we'll really gain is in the electronic transfer of funds,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. Checks being mailed from office to office now can take several days, during which money is not earning interest. The bank-operated system should enable receipts to start earning interest much sooner, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. The bureau may invest trust funds only in government securities or federally insured accounts in banks and savings and loan associations. The bank will not make actual investment decisions, only recommendations to the bureau, which retains legal responsibility for the investments. The bureau had planned to award the contract to <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, but following complaints from tribes that they had not been adequately consulted and from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and other banks that specifications had been too narrowly drawn, the bureau re-opened competition for the contract in March 1987.

<HEAD>Husband Poisoned By Wife Asks Judge To Free Her</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OZARK, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who was fed rat poison by his wife begged a judge not to sentence her to prison, but his plea was ignored by the judge, who gave the woman a five-year sentence. `` We've been married 28 years. If I ever needed her, I need her now. I ca n't even make it to the bathroom now,'' an ailing <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>, 46, said Tuesday at the circuit court hearing. Nevertheless, Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>, 47, to five years in prison and ordered her to pay restitution, court costs and $ 25 to the state victim's compensation fund. The judge suspended Mrs. <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>'s sentence pending a probation hearing. She was released on the same $ 20,000 bond she had been free on since shortly after her arrest in May. No date for the hearing was set. Mrs. <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON> originally was charged with attempted murder in the poisoning of her husband, but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of second-degree assault in an agreement with prosecutors. `` It seemed like a reasonable settlement,'' <LOCATION> Dale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> said. `` She did assault him with rat poisoning. Her husband forgave her before he even got out of the hospital.'' <LOCATION> Dale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Mixon </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>, who was hospitalized following the poisoning, refused to sign an arrest warrant. <PERSON> Mixon </PERSON> said his department signed the warrant. <PERSON> Mixon </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON> apparently poisoned her husband by putting arsenic in his food and drinking water. <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON> had been sick for awhile before his wife's arrest. He now needs a walker to get around. Mrs. <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON> had suffered a work-related accident before the charges were brought against his wife. He said it was unclear whether the accident or poison was responsible for <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>'s sickness. <PERSON> Mixon </PERSON> said his department was notified of the poisoning after <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON>'s doctor detected a high level of arsenic in him. <PERSON> Mixon </PERSON> said a possible motive was a life insurance policy on <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON> for an unspecified `` substantial amount of money.''

<HEAD>Senate Won't Pass Bill To Seize Land Adjacent To Battlefield Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wo n't pass a bill for a `` legislative taking'' of land adjacent to the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to prevent the construction of a shopping center, the chairman of the committee involved said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill 307-98 on Aug. 10, taking the 542-acre <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> tract and providing up to $ 30 million in compensation. Such a seizure of land is rare and leaves to a later court determination how much the owner should get. <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities already have approved the shopping center, which is to be accompanied by office and residential development on the tract. The controversy has galvanized many environmentalists and Civil War buffs who see desecration in the location of a shopping center next to the park commemorating the First and Second Battles of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> in the Civil War. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he intended to vote for the measure and expected to send it to the floor But the bill violates a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rule against bringing `` entitlement'' legislation to the floor outside of the budget process, and the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to waive the rule, he said. Sixty senators could vote to set the rule aside, but <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said, `` I frankly do n't think it'll pass a 60-vote point of order at this time in this session.'' Still, he told his colleagues during a discussion of the bill at a committee meeting, `` we are at least saying this is a high priority and this kind of land should not be lost.'' The ranking Republican, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said the last `` legislative taking,'' a seizure of redwood forest lands in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1980, had been projected to cost $ 349 million but would cost $ 1.4 billion. He said land in the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> area was now selling for $ 17 to $ 17.50 per square foot, so the entire tract could cost $ 413 million at the higher figure. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> noted that the committee had left the tract in private hands when it enlarged the park in 1980, deciding that it was not significant enough historically to include in the park. `` We made a mistake'' in 1980, said Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the national park subcommittee, in arguing for support of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill `` We have a necessity to understand how we got where we are,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said in arguing for the significance of the tract. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, author of the recent highly praised one-volume history of the Civil War, `` Battle Cry of Freedom,'' testified at a subcommittee hearing that the Second Battle of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> was the most significant of the war for the South, <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced Wednesday that the state finished last fiscal year with a $ 67 million surplus. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said $ 25 million had been expected and was already credited to the books for the $ 11.6 billion fiscal 1989 budget, $ 26 had to be earmarked under law for a `` rainy day'' account, and the rest may be used to fund some programs that were conditionally vetoed because of budget problems. One critic said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> achieved the surplus by cutting back on human services spending late in fiscal 1988, which ended June 30. Another, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, said any surplus would be the product of tax and fee increases, government borrowing and a `` raid'' on the pension fund. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has campaigned on his record as a fiscal manager.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A bishop and an opposition leader expressed doubt Wednesday that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military rulers will live up to their promise to punish thugs who massacred nine parishioners and burned down two churches. `` We call on God to help us surmount this bloody, ferocious dictatorship,'' Bishop <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Romelus </PERSON> of the western town of <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, co-leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday's massacre `` happened under the very nose of the army and police, and they did not intervene to prevent the bloodshed.'' The government said Tuesday night it `` regretted'' the massacre at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, when two dozen hoodlums killed nine people at Mass and wounded 77, then burned down the building as soldiers watched from an army compound across the street. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said thugs burst into the state-run general hospital Tuesday searching for a survivor of the church massacre, a 32-year-old woman, saying they wanted `` to finish her off.'' The unidentified woman and her daughter, then still in the womb, were wounded Sunday when an assailant stabbed them with a skewer. Doctors saved both. The gang left without finding the woman, the station reported Wednesday. Authorities also promised to find and punish those responsible for burning down another church late Monday night. `` It is difficult to have confidence in the promises of the military government,'' <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government has issued statements of regret in the past following mass murders and political assassinations but no convictions resulted. Five men and a woman appeared on state television boasting they took part in the massacre, which they said was directed at the Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of the army. They threatened `` a heap of corpses'' if <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> holds future Masses. The six made no attempt to hide their identity and spoke on the government network without apparent fear of arrest or reprisals. <PERSON> Romelus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s uncle and the most radical of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 10 bishops, said, `` If the leaders of the government are not responsible should n't they have arrested them -LRB- the six -RRB- immediately?'' He said the military government `` deplored and condemned and promised to arrest only after other countries made their declarations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> accused the government of allowing the massacre. `` The police stood by during the attacks,'' said a statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. `` Since there is a military post very near the church the commission can only conclude that this attack was perpetrated at least with the acquiescence of the government.'' The commission had sent a fact-finding mission to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> returned to power after ousting the 4-month-old civilian government of President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> on June 19. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> previously headed a junta which ruled this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation for two years following dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s flight into French exile

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board member disagreed Wednesday in bankruptcy court over who set the evangelist's high salary, with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> saying the board approved it and the director saying the board never acted on the matter. The dismissed TV preacher was called to the stand by attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to win a $ 52 million claim against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, and former top aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorneys want the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> to repay money they say was lost through mismanagement of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> accounts and unjustified compensation and benefits. The trial began Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. The ministry has been trying to reorganize in bankruptcy court since June 1987, three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the ministry amid a sex and money scandal involving former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. The ministry's debts total more than $ 130 million. Asked by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leggett </PERSON> who decided his 1984 salary of $ 228,000, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> replied that it was set by the board of directors. `` I have been with <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> with 15 years and the board began my salary then and any raises would have been voted up from that point,'' he said. However, earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cookman </PERSON>, district superintendent for the Assemblies of God Ministries' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> area and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board from 1980 to 1987, testified that the board of directors `` never ruled on salaries. I do n't know who set the salaries.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has been trying to regain control of the evangelical empire, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television network and the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> resort. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said outside court that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> still is interested in buying back <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, despite the rejection of his offer last week when he failed to prove he had the money to back his $ 172 million bid. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> added, however, `` We're not going to talk about any financing until we get some money, until we hear a faint rustle.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has ordered bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to find a buyer for the ministry. On Monday, he filed a report with <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> saying that he can not recommend a buyer now. He asked <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to allow him until Sept. 27 to file a motion for sale, either to a private buyer or at auction. In his testimony, <PERSON> Cookman </PERSON> said board meetings were run primarily by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, with help from the former executive vice president, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cookman </PERSON> said it was not until March 1987, when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned, that he became aware of the ministry's troubles. `` I was astonished,'' he said, to learn the extent of bonuses given to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other executives. When he first joined the board, <PERSON> Cookman </PERSON> said, he understood <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s salary to be between $ 35,000 and $ 40,000 a year. `` In 1986, I asked <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> what <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s salary was, and my recollection of his reply was $ 200,000.'' He testified that in one meeting the issue of compensation for <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> was raised, but board members were told, `` That comes under the administration of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, and is not a board matter.'' Also Wednesday, an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> auditor testified that because of a lack of documentation at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, he could only assume that some expenses charged to the ministry by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and their top aides were for personal use. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based auditor of tax-exempt organizations, testified Tuesday he could find no paperwork to prove a legitimate business purpose for expenditures including a personal 300-foot water slide at the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' Tega Cay home on <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, two Rolls Royce automobiles and hundreds of thousands of dollars <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and others got through <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> accounts. Under cross-examination Wednesday by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> conceded, however, that because of the lack of documentation, he could only assume the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> were using the cars and other expenditures for no legitimate business purpose. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> also must act on a motion filed by <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, a major <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> creditor, to shut down the ministry and auction off its assets.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises, Health Official Calls For More Aid</HEAD>

 Flood waters receded Wednesday but the death toll kept climbing, and health officials called for international shipments of water-treatment chemicals and medicines to stop a killer epidemic of diarrhea. Health Secretary <PERSON> Manzurul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> on Wednesday said there have been 319,860 official cases of diarrhea and 168 diarrhea-related deaths since Aug. 27. On Tuesday, officials reported 283,703 official cases and 150 deaths. <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> said pharmaceutical companies were working overtime to manufacuture medicines to battle the outbreak of diarrhea caused by floodwaters filled with sewage. `` <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> does not need foreign doctors but will welcome limited quantity of medicines from the friendly countries,'' he said at a news conference. `` <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> needs 75 million water purification tablets out of which it will produce 25 million units locally. We have instructed local companies to produce various life-saving drugs in double shifts,'' he said. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Elnaggar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, said most cases of diarrhea are not being reported to the hospitals. What is believed to be the worst flooding in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> history has caused 1,804 deaths from drowning, snake bites, collapsed buildings and diarrhea, according to daily reports in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers. Officials reports, routinely lower, put the death toll at 899 as of Wednesday. The monsoon flooding has affected more than 30 million people in three-fourths of this country, which is roughly the size of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The real number is impossible to ascertain, given <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s unwieldy bureaucracy and communications that were poor even before the floods Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that water levels in all major rivers were falling fast. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, authorities were pumping water from the main commercial district of Motijheel and some residential areas. But the pumping was causing new flooding in some areas where water had begun to recede. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> Wednesday to provide $ 20 million in wheat to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said here. `` This agreement represents an acceleration of our proposed level of $ 60 million for financial year 1989 to provide the government of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> needed flexibility to respond to food shortage that may occur over next few months,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Shipment of remaining $ 40 million worth of foodgrains will be determined once the full extent of crop loss due to the flooding is known,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the last two weeks committed nearly $ 154 million in flood aid to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> for meeting the emergency caused by the flooding, the statement said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s grandson said in an article published Wednesday that growing criticism of the former Soviet leader has turned into a smear campaign that is hurting him and other family members. But a second article by a well-known journalist indicated the attacks on <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, centered on the bribery trial of his son-in-law, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, is not about to stop. The journalist, <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, also shed some light on how <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> assumed power from <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> in 1964. The two articles sharpened the debate over the 1964-1982 period when <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was in power. An investigation of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era has overtaken the re-evaluation of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repression as the major historical topic under review in the Soviet press. Criticism of previous leaders, under way on a large scale in the more open atmosphere of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, is nevertheless traditional in the Soviet system, and often gives citizens an indirect clue about where the leadership wants to take the country. `` I'm 27 years old, and my independent life is only beginning, but I already feel that my surname ever more frequently has become a stumbling block in the most varied situations,'' <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> wrote in the weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News. `` I want to be just like everyone, I am just like everyone, but many do n't want to see anything in me except my surname,'' he said. He said much of the current criticism of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> for bringing in a period of stagnation and corruption, is justified, but that his grandfather also was a victim of the political system and is being unfairly blamed for mistakes of his aides. The younger <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> said tales of the family's corrupt and opulent lifestyle while his grandfather was in office were partly a result of the lack of information Soviets have about their leaders' private life, and partly a result of the actions of his aunt, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>, who he described as `` uncontrollable. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, charged in a trial that opened Sept. 5 with fostering a huge network of bribery and corruption in the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, is married to <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>. The younger <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> said he went to a normal school and did not associate with the children of high party officials. The sharp criticism of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> continued Wednesday on the pages of the authoritative weekly Literary Gazette. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, who was ousted from his job in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s years, said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was a weak man who knew only how to work the giant party and government apparatus. Soviet society must find out `` how it could happen that in such a difficult period in the history of our motherland, and in the world's history, that the weakest of all leaders who reached this position in Soviet, and perhaps in prerevolutionary times, was at the wheel of management.'' He said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> `` cultivated with almost childlike simplicity the accessories of his cult.'' He said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was a `` master of compromise'' who knew how to place his supporters in the middle and high levels of the party and government apparatus. Those surrounding <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> `` thirsted only for one thing _ that this person would live forever _ that's how good things were for them,'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said. He said that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was considered a weak and transitional figure by other party leaders who wanted to get rid of <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> because of his erratic policies. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s ouster was orchestrated not by <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> or conservative party ideology chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Suslov </PERSON>, but by former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelepin </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Shelepin </PERSON> led a group that plotted against <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> in meetings in football stadiums and other unlikely places, he said. In a key move, <PERSON> Shelepin </PERSON> successfully changed <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s personal guard when he was called back from vacation for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting at which he was replaced That tipped <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> off, and he tried to stop the flight taking him to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but he could not, <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said a speech by <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Adzhubei </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s son-in-law and editor of the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, served as impetus to call the meeting He said <PERSON> Adzhubei </PERSON> suggested that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> saw no great problems preventing reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The leaders of ... -LRB- Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- quickly expressed their indignation to their Soviet colleagues, and this served as the spark that lit the flame.'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was in debt to <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> for advancing his party career, with <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> moving up steadily in the Ukrainian party apparatus while <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was at its head. The journalist noted the two leaders' opposite approaches to policy. He said <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was bold and took risks while <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> tried to minimize risk and was very cautious.

 Ex-Olympian ice skater <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> <PERSON> Babilonia </PERSON>, despondent about recent performances, was hospitalized Wednesday after overdosing on pills, authorities said. Paramedics took <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Babilonia </PERSON> at 9:30 a.m. to <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she was treated and discharged almost four hours later in good condition, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Correia </PERSON> said. The type of pills taken and other details were n't disclosed. `` I am not at liberty to discuss the treatment,'' Miss <PERSON> Correia </PERSON> said. The 28-year-old skating star had earlier called her manager to say she was unhappy about recent performances and that she had taken a large amount of pills, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frio </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Miss <PERSON> Babilonia </PERSON>'s mother was then notified and she notified paramedics, who picked the skater up at the family's home. Despite the conversation with her manager, <PERSON> Frio </PERSON> said investigators `` are carrying it as an accidental overdose.'' Detective <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> said police received a phone call from the skater's father, retired <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON> <PERSON> Babilonia </PERSON>, who said his daughter took the pills accidentally and that it was n't a suicide attempt. `` <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> <PERSON> Babilonia </PERSON> was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for treatment of severe stomach cramps due to a reaction to a non-prescription medication,'' said her publicist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. He denied it was a suicide attempt and said the police report about the skater's conversation with her manager was wrong. `` Yes, her manager spoke to her this morning, but it was a very routine conversation,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. `` The cops are n't infallible.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Wednesday that Soviet test-launching of an SS-25 mobile intercontinental ballistic missile showed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to develop mobile strategic missiles, something he said would never happen if Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected president. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee who is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was told of the test by officials of <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION>, the joint U.S.-Canada warning system. The senator toured a <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> facility earlier in the day. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was told that the Soviets launched the SS-25 at 8:50 a.m. EDT from Plesetsk, aimed at <LOCATION> Kamchatka </LOCATION>, just across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The Soviets informed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of the launch, he said. The Soviets have two types of mobile ICBM missiles, the SS-25 and the SS-24. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not presently have mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, although two such missiles _ the Midgetman and the <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> MX _ have been under development. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intercontinental ballistic missiles presently are in concrete silos buried in the ground. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is opposing modernization of our land-based missile force, while the Soviets are already ahead of us,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The governor has already stated that he opposes flight testing of our missiles so even if he wanted to develop a deterrent, his flight test ban would prevent us from ensuring that the system would work,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Do we want someone with the governor's views sitting across the negotiating table from Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' he added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, called the MX, which he opposes, a `` sitting duck.'' He said, `` The strategic concept of the Midgetman is sound, but I question the value of spending $ 40 billion or $ 50 billion for 500 additional land-based missile warheads _ at three times the cost of the same number of new submarine-based warheads.'' It was a day in which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> continued his attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, portraying him as weak on defense and foreign policy issues. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> could never have achieved the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty `` if the nuclear freeze advocated by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been adopted,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The only thing he would have frozen in place was a dangerous, destabilizing Soviet medium-range nuclear monopoly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke to the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Kiwanis-Rotary clubs, where several hundred protesters staged a noisy demonstration as he arrived. They carried signs reading `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Cocaine, Contra'' and `` A Vote for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a Vote for Death.'' In his speech, the second this week to hit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor did not understand the need for such weapons as the MX and Midgetman missiles and for the Star Wars space-based missile defense system. The proposed defense shield, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` is a moral, superior way of defending <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like the Soviets, understands the importance of a missile defense system, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't need a primer on national security. Neither do I,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> center near <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. He received a briefing on the system, which provides a warning in the event of space, missile or air attack on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The senator saw a simulated attack by the Soviets and `` how we would handle that,'' said Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Piotrowski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> commander. The demonstration took place in the steel buildings embedded under 1,700 feet of granite at <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. The news media were barred from entering the NORAD complex, <PERSON> Piotrowski </PERSON> said, because of a federal law which bars political campaigning at military installations. At a rally later at a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> airport hangar, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was heckled by demonstrators who held signs reading `` Students Unite Against Bush-Quayle'' and who chanted, `` Where was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>?'' as he began to speak. Gesturing to the protesters, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Some of those, they keep walking around in circles. We have a message to talk about. The people that they support, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he does n't have a message, he does n't have any ideas. He does n't know where to lead this country.'' `` He got on a tank, I saw the other day,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Glad he knows what one looks like.'' The combination of heckling from the crowd and Dukakis-baiting by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> continued at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> state fair in <LOCATION> Alburquerque </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters chanting `` Go Home Quayle,'' shouted throughout <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s speech. `` As you listen to this babble over here, you ca n't help but think of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> positions,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` They have no positions. They're loud but they do n't have any ideas. `` I understand you have a balloon festival coming up the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has a lot of hot air, why do n't you invite him?''

 Confessed hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denied Wednesday that he headed the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking that claimed the life of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver and kept 39 Americans captive for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on Wednesday also accused witnesses of giving false testimony after some said he gloated over the killing of an American passenger. `` The testimony very often deviates far from the truth,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court. `` I was not the leader of the commando.'' Flight engineer <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said on Tuesday that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> pointed with pride to blood stains of murdered <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> on the airplane fuselage. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also said someone else ordered the hijacking. But when asked by Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON>, he refused to name the man he said ordered it. `` The one who gave us the orders came on board after <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> two, and took over the command,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said, referring to the second time the plane landed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said the man spoke English well and boarded the plane with Shiite Moslem Amal militiamen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was slain. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> this week identified <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as the hijacker who shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> to death. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has admitted taking part in the hijacking but has denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. The flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> was hijacked June 14, 1985 and first diverted to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Witnesses have testified that the situation became more relaxed on board the plane after the Amal militia arrived. Negotiations with the hijackers also improved, members of the flight crew said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also told the court that hand grenades carried by the hijackers had been defused. `` We did not want to blow up the plane. We were worried that someone would make a wrong move, cause the grenades to fall and explode and crash the plane,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> disputed other testimony that he had gone to the toilet of the aircraft to get arms smuggled onboard the plane. `` The other one went to the toilet. I sat in the window seat and talked with the first witness,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said, referring to former hostage <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> testified earlier that he sat next to <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and the other hijacker and that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was the one who went for the weapons. Witnesses have said they heard the crash of glass when one of the hijackers went to the toilet to get the weapons. They said they believed the weapons had been concealed in a glass container. Examination of glass shards from the plane revealed they did not contain enough lead to have foiled X-ray security checks, according to court evidence. After briefly answering questions, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court he had only intended to make a statement and was `` not prepared to answer any further questions.'' In other testimony Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Noesner </PERSON> said his office opened its investigation the day the hijacking began. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had assembled substantial evidence in the case but much of it was not released for security reasons. He said essential evidence was given to West German investigators. `` We of course identified <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as being one of the hijackers,'' <PERSON> Noesner </PERSON> said. He added the two other suspects who are still at large had also been identified and charged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was identified by pictures and that suspected hijackers <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Izzedine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwa </PERSON> was identified through pictures and `` a number of reliable sources I can not disclose.'' But <PERSON> Noesner </PERSON> told the court that fingerprints found on the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner during the investigation were not <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s. He said the plane was in poor condition and that attempts were made to clean it, apparently to get rid of fingerprints and other evidence. The aircraft was returned to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Aug. 14, 1985, nearly two months after the hijacking. Other evidence found on the airplane included `` blood stains near the door ... and AK-47 bullet hulls,'' <PERSON> Noesner </PERSON> said. The court recessed until Sept. 20, when another member of the flight crew is scheduled to testify.

 Israeli leaders on Wednesday spurned the latest overture by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who used the Hebrew greeting `` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>'' to wish Israelis a happy new year on the Jewish holiday. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops shot and wounded 20 Palestinians, hospital officials said. The army confirmed 13 casualties among demonstrators. Masked assailants in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> stabbed to death an Arab suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, used the Hebrew greeting _ the equivalent of Happy New Year _ at a news conference in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, a day after he addressed Socialist members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. In his speech, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was working toward the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and accepted all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions, including 242 and 338 which recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Reaction by top Israelis was icy. `` It is a new year's blessing calling for the destruction of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc's campaign for the Nov. 1 general elections. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told supporters at a campaign rally in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that `` the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is not a partner for talks.'' `` Seven weeks have gone by since King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'' of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> announced he was cutting his links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and handing over responsibility to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is incapable of taking up the challenge, even in words.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s leader, criticized <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> legislators for receiving <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` All of sudden, they started one more time to fall in love with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he met on Wednesday with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he was reassured by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. He said she `` objects vigorously to the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in exile.'' Palestinian leaders appeared split over <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements. <PERSON> Hathem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazale </PERSON>, a prominent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said, `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visit is a Palestinian breakthrough in the countries where the Zionist movement was born and later developed.'' But deposed <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawwa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was `` running around in empty circles.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> hardliners and Moslem fundamentalist groups oppose a unilateral declaration of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> government-in-exile because it would imply recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Israeli peace activist <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who defied <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law to meet <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> this week, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was ready to negotiate peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I believe that today ... we are closer to peace than ever before,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said. Palestinian youths on Wednesday stoned <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and burned tires in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and Shati. Troop gunfire wounded nine Palestinians in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and seven in Shati, including two teen-agers who were in serious condition, said Arab hospital officials. The army confirmed seven wounded in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and three in Shati. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lid </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, soldiers fired to disperse villagers resisting an army raid, an army official said. Three Palestinians were wounded and several Palestinians were arrested, he said. Another Palestinian was wounded in a clash in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village <LOCATION> Burquin </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Assailants dragged 30-year-old Palestinian Adli Thalga from his <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> home and stabbed him to death. He allegedly collaborated with Israeli authorities. Seven Palestinians accused of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have been killed the Palestinian rebellion began on Dec. 8 in the Israeli-occupied territories. The uprising has claimed the lives of 265 Palestinians and six Israelis. <PERSON> Thalga </PERSON> was the fifth alleged collaborator to be killed in 10 days following a call from <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising leaders to `` rid ourselves of collaborators.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> meanwhile attacked proposals raised by some <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> politicians to annex large parts of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, saying it would turn <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into `` a racist, apartheid state.'' `` Racism and Judaism do n't go together,'' he said. But <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not hand back all lands captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 They sleep on the ground after 24 hours or more of potentially deadly work, gobble cold food when they get the chance, and shower off layers of sweat-streaked dirt every few days. But firefighters say they love their jobs. It's action: carving bare-earth control lines with shovels or bulldozers, dousing flames with hoses, piloting helicopters that drop water from buckets. It's better than some boring job, they say, or just sitting around at a fire station. And, they add, their efforts are usually appreciated. A sign at an entrance to a firefighters' camp at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fairgrounds Wednesday said, `` We Love You Firefighters.'' Red hearts were plastered around the message to nearly 3,000 firefighters who began battling a huge blaze Sunday near this gold country community 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. `` I'm going to make a career out of firefighting,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, 25, who drives a fire engine during the summer for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. `` I like the outdoors and I like the action. I love it.'' <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> and his crew of seasonal firefighters from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were among state forces from throughout central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that first attacked the `` 49er Fire,'' which burned more than 30,000 acres in four days, razing nearly 100 homes. `` We worked almost 40 hours straight, from Sunday morning to Monday night. We ate C-rations when we had the time and finally got our first hot meal after we were relieved and sent to fire camp,'' said <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, who is a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> carpenter in the off-season. `` Then I got my first shower in a couple days,'' he said. `` After that long, it's always the best shower of your life.'' Like most others at the sprawling camp, <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> and his crew bedded down in paper sleeping bags on the ground, with clothing for pillows. Among those sprawled across the grass and draped on fire trucks from state, federal and local agencies were plenty of female firefighters. Forestry department seasonal firefighter <PERSON> Talley </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarris </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, said she's often asked why a woman would want to battle flames. `` I like being grimy and not sleeping,'' she said, laughing. `` We're one big happy family,'' <PERSON> Tarris </PERSON> added. Not everyone fighting fires has it as rough as the ground troops. The crews that operate helicopters, which carry water in buckets to douse hot spots, were based next to the firefighters' camp but slept 30 miles away in a motel so they would be properly rested. Even those crews do n't always take advantage of the comparatively posh arrangement, however. `` Sometimes it's more of a pain to go in -LRB- to a motel -RRB- than it's worth,'' said pilot <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramage </PERSON> of <PERSON> Redding </PERSON> `` Then we just sleep on the ground, too.''

 CBS' weekly news show `` 48 Hours'' is doing a quick switch Thursday to live coverage of Hurricane Gilbert rather than the previously planned taped report on infertility.

<HEAD>Group Claims American Who Escaped Abductors Was CIA Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A little-known group claimed Wednesday that an American who escaped abduction in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this week was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent and that he was freed intentionally. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, 25, was an American engineer who overpowered his captors after he was kidnapped on Sunday. He reportely works in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and holds a black belt in karate. The group, calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, claimed it captured <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> because he was on an espionage mission and then released him. The claims were in a note delivered to the west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> office of the Italian <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency and were accompanied by photos of <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> driver's license and his Saudi Arabian work permit. It was the first known statement from the previously unheard of group. An <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> employee said the note was found in a white envelope left at the doorstep of the agency office after someone rang the doorbell and left. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was abducted briefly with his new Shiite Moslem bride, <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Haydar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharafeddine </PERSON>, shortly after the couple wed Sunday in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s ancient city of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>. But reports varied as to how the couple gained freedom. Lebanese press reports Monday said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> used karate to disarm his captives and escape. Syrian government sources said the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troops who control east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley rescued the couple after a nightlong search and took them to the Syrian capital of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, where they were turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` In recent days, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> sneaked into the territory of our beloved country on an open spying mission for a whole month under the pretext of marrying a Lebanese,'' said the statement from the group. `` Our courageous strugglers, however, were alert. They chased him, arrested him, interrogated him and warned him to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at once. Then they freed him, hoping that the Americans will get the message that we emphatically reject their overt interference in our internal affairs,'' the statement added. It accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` harboring animosity to our nationalist causes and supporting the enemies of our people and the Arab nation.'' The statement also expressed support for Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. The language of the statement suggests the group behind it may be leftist rather than the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists believed to be holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine Americans are among the hostages, including <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest held of all the hostages, was abducted March 16, 1985 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The photo with the statement was of a driver's license issued in <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' work permit, issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Aviation. It listed him as a maintenance technician and is valid until June 29, 1989.

 Several thousand people Wednesday evacuated the marshy, flood-prone coast of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> as Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> churned into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> packing twice the power of last week's Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. `` This is very, very serious,'' said <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Curole </PERSON>, hurricane coordinator for LaFourche Parish on the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast. `` <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is a killer storm, something a lot of people have never experienced, even in this area.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, already blamed for at least 11 deaths in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, was on a path toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Wednesday afternoon, forecasters said as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a hurricane watch for the state's entire coastline. But with the unpredictable storm three days away, authorities met to review evacuation plans across hundreds of miles from the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. On the <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, beachgoers and about 3,000 residents were urged to leave by sundown and most were cooperating, said Police Chief <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> of Crystal Beach.

The ground remained water-logged, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s deputy director of emergency management, and floodwaters blocked the only two roads from <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s barrier islands and other evacuation routes. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is a much larger and more dangerous storm than <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, which hit southeastern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Friday night, flooding roads and knocking down power lines but doing little major damage. `` You've got tropical gale force winds all the way out 250 miles'' from the eye of the hurricane, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Piercy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Evacuations started earlier this week, when oil companies used helicopters and crew boats to take an estimated 10,000 workers from offshore rigs. More evacuation orders were likely Thursday morning, even if the storm's path remains uncertain, authorities said. `` You can not evacuate people at night and you ca n't evacuate people when the winds and rain have already started,'' said <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, police Lt. B.D. <PERSON> Spradlin </PERSON>. Grocery and hardware stores were swamped with shoppers and lumber and water supplies were reported in short supply throughout the region. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> residents lined up 10 to 15 deep at check out lanes in one hardware store where plywood for covering windows was the hot selling item. A caravan of cattle trucks jammed a two-lane road out of coastal <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, where purebreds graze in the lush marshland. In <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, school was canceled for the rest of the week. In the nearby beach resort of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aransas </LOCATION>, officials handed out emergency passes to residents leaving town, to control access and prevent looting in the event of a disaster. Most of the damage would be to homes and low-rise buildings, which are generally designed to withstand winds of up to 90-100 mph, said <PERSON> Kishor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and an associate at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> could easily cause damage in the neighborhood of $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion if it hits the right place,'' <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U-Haul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkhart </PERSON> described the scene at the self-service rental center in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> where his office is located `` It's almost like a mass panic situation,'' <PERSON> Kirkhart </PERSON> said. `` We have so many people calling and coming in here that we had to start a waiting list, and it keeps growing before we can get more equipment in.'' Because of a shortage of lumber, he said, some <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> residents have driven as far as <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> to rent trucks and trailers, bringing plywood back with them to board up homes prior to evacuating.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Wednesday wished <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` Happy New Year'' in Hebrew, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials dismissed it as a public relations ploy. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also got a message from another quarter Wednesday _ King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said that since his kingdom cut ties with the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on July 30, it is up to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to solve their own problems and they have no one to blame but themselves if they fail. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, addressing <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, a controversial Israeli radio personality and peace crusader, said at a news conference earlier Wednesday: `` I ask you to tell all Israelis and ... all Jews ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>' on this occasion of the Jewish New Year `` When I say <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>, I mean ... in particular a peaceful New Year,'' said the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` A peaceful New Year for all of our children, for all of our peoples, for the whole of the Arab region.'' Jews throughout the world at sundown Tuesday ended celebrations ushering in <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, the Jewish new year. Speaking in Arabic through interpreters, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> addressed reporters on the last day of a two-day visit to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> at the invitation of the body's Socialist group. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the willingness of European and other governments to recognize a provisional Palestinian government on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> would influence a decision to establish such a government. He urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be `` more fair'' towards the Palestinians. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to stand for justice and fairness and should not just think of electoral considerations,'' he said. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s New Year greeting was a `` stunt.'' `` It's very nice to say ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>' in front of a group of journalists, but it would be more constructive if in his speech yesterday there were some concrete change in policy,'' the official said. He was referring to a meeting Tuesday in which <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s socialists that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision to cut its ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> would pave the way for an independent Palestinian state. Israeli officials reject such a state. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s gesture would not change the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to holding talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` We will not be misled by the lip service of Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and seeming gestures like wishing ` <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON>' to our people,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, will make a final decision next month on a provisional government or place the occupied territories under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> trusteeship King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s remarks came during a taped interview with the `` World Monitor'' television program in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In the interview, broadcast Wednesday and monitored in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said he did not believe a `` Jordanian option'' now existed in dealing with the Palestinian question. The monarch said that while <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> remained `` committed ... to the cause of a just and durable peace ... as far as the Palestinian dimension is concerned, the Palestinian problem is in the hands of the Palestinians.'' He said he hoped that the Israelis now `` would realize that there has to be a facing of reality and ... come up with their contribution for the establishment of a just and good peace in the area.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would attend an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference only if asked to do so by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ `` and we'll have to look at it then. When asked if he thought whether <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization was moving in the right direction, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> replied, `` Well, there is certainly no other quarter to blame if they fail to do so.'' He said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> claims to be the sole legitimate representative -LRB- of the Palestinian people -RRB- and I believe it's going to be up to it to prove that this is the case ... Ideally it should be a simultaneous kind of recognition: <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> recognizing the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and their rights on their soil, and ... the Palestinians acting in a way that would recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist on its soil.'' He said that if the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands continues to a point when all hope is lost, `` then it's downhill and into an abyss ... nobody can forecast what can happen.''

 South African police Wednesday attacked hijackers holding a busload of pilgrims going to see Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and said three hijackers and a young woman hostage were killed during the rescue. Eleven passengers were wounded, the remainder were freed and a fourth hijacker was arrested, South African police headquarters said. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> government officials said 71 hostages were in the bus. The military government of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, a black kingdom that lies inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s borders, requested South African help in handling the hijacking. There was no immediate government statement on the shootout. Police said the shootout took place when the hijackers tried to drive the bus through the closed gates of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, or embassy, in <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>. Reporters were barred from the area at the time of the shootout, but later they saw the bus, its windows shot out, lying wrecked in the high commission courtyard just inside the gate. South African police said officers returned fire after the hijackers began shooting. Police said the hostage casualties were `` apparently caused by the wild firing of the hijackers.'' They said no policemen were injured. The shooting broke out about 20 minutes after the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>, eight hours behind schedule. The hijackers earlier demanded to meet with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s king, <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a government official said. After nightfall, gunfire and explosions were heard at the site where the bus was parked, and flares lit up the sky. Reporters were blocked from getting close enough to the scene to see the shootout, but they saw ambulances taking casualties to a hospital. Police ordered journalists at the scene to disperse and then chased them away with whips. The pope arrived in this mountain kingdom after an overland journey from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, where bad weather forced his plane to make an unscheduled landing. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> met Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> at the airport and was briefed about the hijacking before leaving for <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said there were about 70 hostages, including eight nuns, 36 children, 16 women and 10 men. One nun is from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and the rest of the hostages are from <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thabane </PERSON>, secretary for <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s six-man ruling military council. One man escaped Wednesday from the bus. Armed security forces from both <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> surrounded the bus. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> authorities had asked for help with security and that South African personnel were `` in attendance to render advice.'' <PERSON> Thabane </PERSON> said the hijackers belonged to the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He said the government `` has no intention of meeting the demands of terrorists.'' The state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said a man claiming to be a spokesman for the guerrilla group telephoned its <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, office and denied responsibility for the hijacking. The four hijackers posed as pilgrims when they boarded the bus Tuesday at the start of its journey from rural <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, said police commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingiswayo </PERSON>. They then took over the bus, announced they were from the <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and said anyone who resisted would be killed, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers were armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and two grenades. The radio said the hijackers had gone to the British mission because <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the former colonial power in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, was training the country's army and police force. Their request to meet High Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was refused. The radio said the hijackers asked Wednesday that a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest be taken to the bus. Unofficial sources said they believed the priest would open negotiations between the hijackers and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s military rulers. About 100 soldiers and police set up roadblocks with armored cars and kept spectators four blocks away. <PERSON> Gervase </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevasse </PERSON>, deputy British high commissioner, said the bus pulled up outside the high commission Tuesday evening. He said the hijackers asked to enter the compound but were rebuffed. The <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was opposed to the leftist government of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Leabua </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>. Several bombings and killings were blamed on the group, which reportedly had South African backing. The guerrillas left the mountain kingdom after a January 1986 coup deposed <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> and installed a military government more favorable to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. They reportedly have been seeking to restore relations with the military rulers. A nun at the Papal Visit Office, Sister <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Brassard </PERSON>, said the bus came from Quacha's <PERSON> Nek </PERSON>, a remote town in southern <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. The country is surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, a nation of about 1.6 million people, is officially a constitutional monarchy but is ruled by the military council in consultation with the king. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> achieved independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1966.

 <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, widow of slain rock star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, dismissed author <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s controversial version of the couple's life together and apart as `` totally fiction'' Wednesday in a nationally broadcast radio show. `` These people in this book are not us. It's not <PERSON> John </PERSON> and me,'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said in her first broadcast comments on `` The Lives of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'' biography. `` It's unfair he's been assaulted and ca n't hit back. The rare appearance Wednesday night by <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> was prompted by <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s 719-page biography of the ex-Beatle which presents him as an anorexic, bisexual, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> does n't fare much better: <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> presents her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s death and had several affairs while they were married. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> also charges she was responsible for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s 1980 marijuana bust in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and was just as intent on a divorce as <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> denied virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> friends and employees that <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION>'s book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes `` For some reason this book is attempting to rob both <PERSON> John </PERSON> and I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to,'' she said shortly after the broadcast opened with <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s song `` Gim me Some Truth.'' `` It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license. I do n't see <PERSON> John </PERSON> in there ... It's a very dramatically described something, but it's not about <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>. `` It's totally fiction.'' The one-hour broadcast was taped Aug. 28 at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Lennons </ORGANIZATION> lived _ and <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> still lives _ in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The broadcast coincides with the book's official release date, which was also on Wednesday. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was fatally shot by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> outside the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, 1980. The <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One Network; spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON> said a total number of the stations picking up the broadcast was not available. Appearing with <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> were <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s sons, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> is interviewed by long-time associate <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON>, described in <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION>'s book as a spy for <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON>. `` It is for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies, untruths ... The whole thing is just sickening,'' said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON>, who also denied <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s stories about <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> as a terrifying father. <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> read excerpts from the <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> book to <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON>, who then responded to the allegations made by the author point by point. She denied <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was a homosexual; denied he was using drugs while living at the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> with his son, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>; denied he had become a reclusive rock' n' roll <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 1970s, but rejected <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s assertion that she had a $ 5,000-a-week habit. The book already has drawn angry responses from friends of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>; <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, who denied one anecdote involving a violent <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> smashing a painting in <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s home, has urged a boycott of the book. After <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>'s rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900 telephone numbers to vote on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> book is an accurate portrayal of the <ORGANIZATION> Lennons </ORGANIZATION>' life. Results were not expected until Thursday. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> book, has previously written controversial biographies of comedian <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Blues in the Night' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It's hard to get through the night when your man has done you wrong and then gone. So wail the three lonely ladies of `` Blues in the Night,'' a minor musical meditation on the blues that opened Wednesday at off-Broadway's Minetta Lane Theater. The show is a recast, slightly revised revival of the musical revue that had a 53-performance run on Broadway in 1982. This new version had some success in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before resurfacing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a cast that includes <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leilani </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and, from the British production, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. Despite the classy performers, it's difficult to work up much enthusiasm for the show. `` Blues in the Night'' is a strange, anonymous musical with a one-note message and characters that rarely connect with each other, much less the audience. Its women, worn down by men and by life, are identified only as the lady from the road, the woman of the world and the girl with a date. They occupy separate rooms in a cheap hotel in some unknown city. The time is the late 1930s and the hour, of course, is after midnight. The songs are distinctive, most of them well-known classics, but the themes they express are basically the same. The numbers, expertly played by a five-piece band perched above the hotel setting, usually fall into two categories. There's the bluesy lament for all those men who got away, and dirty, double-entendre ditties like `` Kitchen Man'' or `` Take Me for a Buggy Ride,'' performed with gusto by the formidable Miss <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. Each member of the cast _ including <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> as the evening's generic man _ gets a song or two in which they shine. Miss Woods pretty much tears down the place with <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s `` Wasted Life Blues,'' hitting an intensity that's rarely matched by the rest of the production The singer also sasses her way through a vaudeville number called `` New Orleans Hop Scop Blues'' that demonstrates her Olympic-class sense of timing. As the all-purpose woman of the world, the cool Miss <PERSON> Pressley </PERSON> is a revelation. A sleek, sexy songstress, she projects elegance and high style. She can move too, particularly in the old <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> number `` Stompin' at the Savoy'' and in a wild, defiant `` Take It Right Back'' that concludes the first act. Miss <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, as the stereotypical girl on a date, has a harder time because she has the least interesting songs, particularly a bland version of `` Willow Weep for Me.'' When she is allowed to torch her material, particularly a song like `` Reckless Blues,'' the woman can sizzle. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s role is even less defined. He wanders in and out of these melodic tribulations. Occasionally the performer even comments on these down-and-out dames, particularly in a sardonic number `` Wild Women Do n't Have the Blues'' or on himself in a song like <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s `` I'm Just a Lucky So-and-So.'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Epps </PERSON>, who created and directed the show, has boxed the musical into a corner. The songs pile on top of each other, allowing for little emotional variation. Their sheer number gives the evening the blues. `` Blues in the Night'' is best savored for the individual star turns. Taken as a full evening of theater, the production proves to be a tad wearyin'.

 A 24-year-old artist from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> was shot to death Wednesday near the campus of an art institute in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> where she came to study a week ago. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> was shot at least once in the chest as she struggled with a gunman who had demanded her purse while she was walking home about 1 a.m., said police Deputy Inspector <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last Wednesday and enrolled for her first semester at the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to pursue a masters degree in fine arts. The prestigious school's campus sits amid historic mansions, renovated town houses and middle-class apartment towers, but it also adjoins <LOCATION> Bedford-Stuyvesant </LOCATION>, a predominantly poor neighborhood with a high rate of violent crime. Ms. <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON> spent the summer with a brother in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, working three jobs to save money for school, her mother said. `` <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> was just pursuing her dream,'' of studying art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said her mother, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrape </PERSON>, in a tearful telephone interview. Ms. <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON>, a 1987 Notre Dame graduate who spelled her name differently from her parents, had just finished her first night working as a waitress at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurant, said manager <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shay </PERSON>. Detectives believe she took the subway to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and was one block away from the apartment she had rented with three other students when she was approached, <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON> said. `` There was some kind of a struggle between the fellow and the victim, she had shouted out ` Leave me alone,' when he fired one shot, hit her in the chest, and escaped with the handbag,'' <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON> said. During the commotion, a resident of a nearby building had yelled out the window at the gunman to ` Leave her alone,''' <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON> added. `` It was just shortly after that that he fired the shot.'' The handbag was recovered nearby, and it was not known if anything was taken. <PERSON> Shay </PERSON> said he hired the student artist Monday. During her first shift, `` she did mention to someone here that it was a culture shock moving from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' the restaurant manager said. `` It's embarrassing as a New Yorker to have someone come from out of state and meet an untimely death at a young age,'' <PERSON> Shay </PERSON> said. `` It does n't say much for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the people of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON> is survived by her mother, and father, <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrape </PERSON>, and four brothers and a sister, who ranged in age from 22 to 32 years of age.

<HEAD>Israel, Hungary Agree To Restore Diplomatic Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> agreed Wednesday to gradually restore diplomatic ties that were severed 21 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European nation, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reported. The agreement came after a meeting between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Hungarian Prime Minister <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and television said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, reached at his <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> home, refused comment on the reports. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> Wednesday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> agreed in principle to the gradual restoration of ties, but did not set a timetable for upgrading diplomatic representation. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, along with all other Soviet bloc countries except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured lands of the bloc's <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. In the past two years, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and some of its allies sought improved relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have exchanged consular delegations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> resumed low-level diplomatic ties last year, and opened interest sections, the lowest form of diplomatic representation, in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in March. In May, Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> made a surprise visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and said the Hungarian government wanted to expand economic ties with the Jewish state. In 1986, trade between the two countries totaled about $ 22 million. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s state secretary for church affairs, made a five-day visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last week and met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. After his return to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` reinforced <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interest in further developing relations with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and said my visit reflected an ongoing improvement in <LOCATION> Hungarian-Israeli </LOCATION> relations.'' He added, `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> -RRB- could see no reason to prevent the development of relations in all fields, including the diplomatic one.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s private two-day tour of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is the first visit by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister to a Soviet bloc country other than <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> since 1967. On Thursday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, was scheduled to meet with Jewish leaders and visit a synagogue in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. About 80,000 Jews live in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and about 240,000 Jews of Hungarian origin live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deputy chief of staff, ended a three-day unofficial visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to discuss ways to improve military cooperation between the two countries, Hungarian state television reported. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, reportedly the highest-ranking American army officer to visit the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country, held talks with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Szucs </PERSON>, deputy chief of staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and met with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacsek </PERSON>, chief of staff and deputy defense minister, the report said. According to Hungarian television, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> `` inquired about the Hungarian defense doctrine and -LRB- conferred on -RRB- possibilities to further develop ties between the armies of the two countries.'' `` With the political improvement between -LRB- <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- possibilities have opened up for better -LRB- military -RRB- ties'' the television report said, without further elaboration.

 Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo remained in the lead by a slim margin Wednesday as the recount continued of ballots cast in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary race. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> election officials said they would announce results Thursday. `` It's a very tedious process, step-by-step, vote-by-vote,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Markell </PERSON>, Woo's deputy campaign manager and a recount observer. He said he expected the counting of ballots to go into the early morning. Woo's opponent, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, was unavailable for comment, said staff member aide <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>. `` He's out,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` And I hope he's having a good time.'' After recounts in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s other two counties, results did not change from earlier certified ballots that gave Woo an 88-vote lead over Beard. The recount was requested by both candidates on Monday after it was discovered a clerical error gave Beard 2,800 votes too many. Beard had claimed victory after Saturday's primary, but found himself trailing after the mistake was found and votes were counted from nine precincts that had not reported immediately after the polls closed. Woo and Beard are seeking the party's nomination for the right to challenge Republican Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the November election. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> did not have a primary challenger. Beard thought he had won with 22,418 votes to Woo's 19,624. By Monday night, the unofficial statewide tally showed Beard with 20,133 to Woo's 20,221. The 2,800-vote mistake occurred in the 23rd representative district in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where about 280 Democrats are registered. Beard received 28 votes there, but the votes were recorded as 2,828 in the computer at the county's department of elections, according to the county elections director. Woo, 51, is a physics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, and was elected elected lieutenant governor four years ago. Beard, 49, has been chairman for job creation commissions under the past four presidents.

 Jamaican-Americans rallied quickly to their hurricane-devastated homeland's aid, and hundreds of doctors and nurses and tons of supplies Wednesday waited for clearance to fly to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area, home to the nation's largest Jamaican community, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> health clinic began accepting food, clothing and bedding for shipment to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, and several local <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> groups set up relief funds. Dozens of the 50,000 to 60,000 Jamaicans living in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> flocked to the Jamaican Consulate in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, waiting nervously for word of conditions back home. Others staffed makeshift relief supply centers, gathering tons of food, medicine, clothing, and building materials. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> promised to fly supplies to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> for free. But word of the wreckage Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> left in its aftermath made islanders doubt any relief effort would bring their country back. `` <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> was beautiful. Now they ca n't even recognize it,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, waiting for the chance to bring food and medicine to his family in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. `` I almost want to laugh,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` It's something you ca n't believe but you just have to accept it. It do n't make sense to cry.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> told his nation <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was the island's worst natural disaster ever. The Jamaican community of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which puts on reggae music festivals and has its own clubs and radio shows, often is overshadowed by larger Latin American communities here. But the community is closely knit and maintains strong interest in its homeland, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` They did not wait for the storm to hit before they began organizing themselves and when they met with consul general they already had things under way. The response has been marvelous. It's always so where our country is concerned,'' said <PERSON> Lancelot </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the consulate's information officer <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> added that the Cuban community also is contributing to the relief effort, and Spanish-language radio stations broadcast appeals for help. A Telex from the Jamaican government said blankets, sheets, cots, tents, medical supplies, water, and nonperishable items are badly needed. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> for the Jamaican <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION>, said hundreds of doctors and nurses were ready to travel to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> as soon as the government requested medical assistance. <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the relief division of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that it had already provided $ 55,000, and was asking member churches to raise an additional $ 100,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said the federal government was sending relief supplies totaling $ 396,000 by military aircraft from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The supplies include 360 rolls of plastic sheeting, 200 tents, 3,966 water jugs, 18 water tanks, 10 chain saw kits and 9,600 cotton blankets. Partners of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, a group of 60 countries including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and nations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> announced it had set up a relief fund to help the people of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> is not like <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. People do not have insurance. It will all be their expense,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` If there's any help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can give, we're going to need it.'' The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> Action Lobby, an organization encompassing numerous groups of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> immigrants, began drawing up plans for a `` major fund-raising event'' _ as yet unspecified, said its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> regional president, Dr. <PERSON> Waldaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. A hurricane relief task force from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Jamaican community, estimated at 300,000 to 600,000 people and concentrated in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, intends to meet Friday with Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and Saturday with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said.

 A minister who helped arrange meetings of street gang members aimed at ending violence was accused in a warrant Wednesday of masterminding a plan to take out $ 125,000 in fraudulent student loans. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was charged with 15 counts of grand theft, 13 counts of forgery, and one count of conspiracy to defraud. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, 24, who helped arrange two much-publicized gang `` summit meetings'' this summer, did n't respond to a telephone request for comment. Seven others charged in the case are accused of taking out student loans and turning the money over to <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who promised them $ 3,000 each, District Attorney's spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said Wednesday. A criminal complaint filed Tuesday accused <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> of arranging a scheme to take out government-insured student loans from a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags have sold more briskly since Republicans `` began restoring pride'' in the country in 1981. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stressed support for some weapons and muted earlier opposition to others as he sought to blunt attacks on his defense credentials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also touted smaller than expected trade deficit figures and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused the Republicans of opposing `` every single effort'' to reform the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, while their managers fleshed out details on the campaign debates that are expected to be pivotal in the close race for the White House. Officials said that vice presidential candidates <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would hold their only debate of the fall on Oct. 5 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was fixed as the site of the second and final Bush-Dukakis debate on either Oct. 13 or 14. The two contenders for the White House square off a week from Sunday in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in their first debate of the campaign. Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` I've been looking forward to it.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, which was to have hosted a debate Wednesday night, and taunted the vice president for his refusal to make it a date. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't ready today after seven and a half years as vice president of this country, how can we expect him to be ready on Jan. 20, 1989?'' the Democrat said. Public opinion polls in recent days have shown <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holding a single-digit lead, and Democratic aides said privately they did n't look for much change in the 10 days before the debates begin However, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC News released Wednesday showed the two candidates essentially tied, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading 48-45. The survey of 1,092 likely voters had a three-point margin of error. The survey concluded two days after the recent surveys. The vice president said some polls were good and others were n't. `` They cancel out.'' And he did, wooing Hispanic and Asian voters in a tour of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the biggest prize with 47 electoral votes. The vice president said joblessness among Hispanics has fallen almost twice as fast under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as when the Democrats were in the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was `` new pride in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' demonstrated by the performance of a flag-making company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Under the Democratic administration of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, he said, `` They were n't selling that well.'' `` Well, since we began restoring pride in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, business has been booming,'' he said, without naming the company. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he opposed a grape boycott being led by farm workers union official <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> and said that was a big difference between himself and the `` liberal governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' Standing in a field in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, surrounded by fruit crates, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted figures showing that the trade deficit fell to a smaller than expected $ 9.53 billion in July. `` We are moving in the right direction,'' he said. Capping the day in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was feted at a colorful rally in a <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> park, but about 400 demonstrators gathered in Union Square across the luxury St. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> hotel where he was to deliver a speech. At one point before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived, protesters began spilling out into the street, crossing barricades, stopping traffic and the city's famed cable cars. Police led several away and at least one person arrested. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters passed out anti-Bush fortune cookies in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hosts countered with a huge fortune cookie containing the message, `` November brings good fortune.'' `` Only one person _ only one person can carry <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s peace and prosperity into the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, describing himself as that person. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added a few well-aimed barbs at the Democrats during the day, when he said the opposition was to blame for `` economic and foreign policy nightmares.'' `` The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's memory lane, it starts to look like ` Nightmare on Elm Street,''' the president said on a campaign trip to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, portrayed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as weak on defense matters, said in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he would use force `` when it's necessary to protect our territory, our citizens or our vital interests, to meet our treaty commitments and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks.'' He offered no specifics, nor did he reply to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s challenge _ repeated during the day in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ to say whether he favored the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983 or the bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1985. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> listed the Stealth bomber, the Trident II sea-based missile, the advanced cruise missile, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, a new attack submarine and a new anti-tank weapon as systems he favors. He criticized the MX missile, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors, as a `` smoke and mirrors'' proposal. His speech also reflected the softening in his earlier adamant opposition to the proposed Star Wars space-based defense shield. He repeated his statement from last week that he wants $ 1 billion a year for continued research and would consider deploying the system under some circumstances. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has opposed the Midgetman missile in the past, but in his speech said `` the strategic concept ... is sound but I question the value of spending $ 40 billion or $ 50 billion for 500 land-based missile warheads.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also charged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with neglecting conventional weapons, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> sounded a similar theme as he donned a leather flight jacket and fired up a single-engine trainer at an airplane museum. `` Under this administration, <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has been promoted and our conventional forces have been neglected,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who was a World War II bomber pilot. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured the NORAD missile warning center in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and later strongly defended the Star Wars program as a `` moral, superior way of defending <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> abandoned an effort to expand federal coverage for Medicaid abortions in the face of strong opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in July had voted 73-19 to allow federal financing for Medicaid abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest, but it backed down on Tuesday in a bow to political reality. Under current law, federal spending for Medicaid abortions is permitted only if the procedure is needed to save a woman's life. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its support for that policy last week, and in the process rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal for rape and incest exceptions. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had promised to veto a $ 140 billion spending bill containing all the fiscal 1989 money for the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and Education if it came to him with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s abortion provision.

 New devices that automatically deliver heart-starting electrical jolts and can be operated with little training could save many of the 400,000 Americans who die each year of cardiac arrest, according to a new report. The machines are sophisticated versions of the defibrillators that doctors and paramedics have used for decades, but so automated that they are much easier to use. When attached to the chest, the device will check the victim's heart and deliver a shock if it finds he has suffered cardiac arrest, a disastrous interruption in the heart's blood-pumping rhythm If given soon enough, the shock almost always restarts the stalled heart.

 <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> did n't. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> did. Getting scandal-entangled women to bare all is a major coup for men's magazines, which pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to titillate. Besides dangling six-figure fees, such magazines as <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> and Penthouse wine and dine these formerly obscure women and offer the promise of nationwide publicity. The reason is simple: scandal sells. `` Women, or even men who are at the center of a storm, of any kind, are always best-sellers,'' said Penthouse publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON>. When Indiana Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was chosen as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, <PERSON> Penthouse </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> rushed to resurrect features on <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, the comely blond lobbyist who accompanied <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and two other politicians on a golf outing eight years ago. Playboy's November issue includes new coments from Parkinson, claiming <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> propositioned her on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> weekend, and a nude photograph of Parkinson taken in 1980. Penthouse's story, also for November, includes fresh remarks from a 1981 interview about an alleged dalliance with Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, as well as statements about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` The idea behind this is to get somebody who's in the public eye ... and show something about that person that you ca n't find any place else,'' said <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrman </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> publishing executive and now chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s journalism school here. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the former church secretary whose sexual encounter with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> evangelist's downfall last year, got her second Playboy feature in the September issue. Her first spread appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s November 1987 issue, featuring several nude photographs and <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s version of what happened with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The issue sold more than 5 million copies at newsstands, about 1.5 million more than usual. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> contends Penthouse offered her $ 12 million to appear. She chose instead to tell her story to <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> for a rumored $ 1 million. `` Playboy approached me and Penthouse -LRB- too -RRB- pretty much when the story broke,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, 29, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, where she's working in radio. Penthouse, she said, `` was making a lot of promises that they could not keep. The money was endless. I mean it was ridiculous.'' Playboy contends <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and an agent first approached the magazine, which <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> denies. Regardless of who made the first move, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges she was a big catch. `` If there is another magazine out there that we feel competitive with ... we try to get our offer on the table first, and I think there was probably some of that that went on with <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, managing photo editor for Playboy. Penthouse struck it rich with its July issue, featuring the woman at the center of the scandal involving televangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. The magazine includes explicit photos of <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> showing the things she contends <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> asked her to do in a motel room. The <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> issue sold out in five days, selling more than 4 million copies, double the normal newsstand sales, according to Penthouse officials. <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> and an attorney for <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> declined to reveal how much she was paid, but it was rumored to be $ 75,000 to $ 100,000. <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>, jailed in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> on an unrelated prostitution charge, was not available for comment. Her attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Weymann </PERSON>, explained her motivation. `` Primarily, she was trying to get out of the life that she had found herself in. There was the motivation of not only the money, but also to set the record straight of exactly what happened,'' he said. Scandals, especially those involving sex, are guaranteed hits for magazines because the public wants `` to see the naked woman who played <PERSON> Delilah </PERSON> to whatever <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> of the moment,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> photographer. <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON>'s photographs of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the non-typing secretary and ex-mistress of former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, wound up in Hustler magazine. Nude photos of <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> also appeared in Penthouse and <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>. But capitalizing on scandals can be tricky, said <PERSON> Nancie </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, editor in chief of Playgirl magazine. `` You have to get to people at the right time. You have to pay them a lot of money. You have to hope it's still a scandal when the magazine comes out. `` There's always the concern that it might be exploitive, that you might be taking somebody involved in a sex scandal and giving them more limelight than they deserve,'' she said. Often, posing nude is a way for women linked to scandal to create or advance careers, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. But why would someone like <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, ex-wife of former <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Congressman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, want to bare her body to millions? `` I thought it would be a hoot, a funny thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, 38, who appreared in Playboy in April 1981 after her husband's bribery and conspiracy conviction in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Abscam investigation. `` People caught in the midst of turmoil, you do a lot of uncharacteristic things,'' said <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, now living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and pursuing an acting career. `` I never anticipated the criticism.'' She said a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reporter and his wife persuaded her to pose, and <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> says it willingly agreed. `` There is a curiosity about these people that the other news media pick up. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> was everywhere,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- we had her story, and we had glamorous nude photographs of her.'' The issue featuring <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> sold a little more than 6.2 million copies, more than a million over normal sales of the time. `` It was one of our biggest sellers,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> says she does n't think Playboy exploited her troubles to make a buck. As far as men's magazines making money off the scandal, she said, `` What else is there? It sells. ... The sensational grabs people.'' That's why <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Penthouse </PERSON>, offering six-figure payoffs, hotly pursued <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, whose relationship with former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> doomed his presidential hopes, and <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the blond <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> secretary who helped <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> shred and alter documents about arms deals in the Iran-Contra scandal. `` <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> I think we were close to making a deal with at one point,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` Nudity was discussed. She just walked away from it. There were several conversations with her, lunches ... but no deal was made. Why she turned us down, I do n't know ... `` Fawn Hall ... would have certainly been a cover -LRB- story -RRB-, would have sold well,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Playboy would not disclose their offers, but <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> said Penthouse offered Rice about $ 350,000 and Hall $ 250,000 `` because anybody in the country would want to read'' about them. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Plato </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON>, said he understood the interest in his client. But `` the money did not tempt her,'' he said. `` She's too much of a lady ... and she's not going to try to capitalize in any unseemly way.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> could not be reached and her <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McAliley </PERSON> was vacationing and unavailable to explain why she rejected the offers. Should she or Hall have second thoughts, it may be too late. `` The timing is all-important,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` Right now, I do n't think either of them have much value.''

 The term paparazzi comes from a private joke by film director <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellini </PERSON>. Paparazzo was the name of an aggressive celebrity photographer in <PERSON> Fellini </PERSON>'s 1959 film `` La Dolce Vita.'' But according to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, the famed Italian moviemaker found the Italian name in the 1901 English novel `` By the <LOCATION> Ionian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>,'' by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Giffing </PERSON>, which <PERSON> Fellini </PERSON> read while making `` La <ORGANIZATION> Dolce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vita </ORGANIZATION>.'' In the book, Mr. <PERSON> Paparazzo </PERSON> is an innkeeper. There is no Italian word `` paparazzo,'' and the common plural for the photographers, paparazzi, was invented.

<HEAD>Public Television Brings `Thin Blue Line' Wide Audience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` The Thin Blue Line,'' the documentary movie about a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> murder that has audiences buzzing, owes its origin to an unusual source _ public television. The film, playing in selected theaters across the country, is among the latest fruits of an innovative financing deal created by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s `` American Playhouse'' series. The arrangement, by which <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> helps pay production costs in exchange for first television rights, has yielded some of the most critically acclaimed independent films in recent years, including 1983's `` Testament,'' 1984's `` <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON>,'' 1985's `` Smooth Talk,'' last year's `` Stand and Deliver'' and now, `` The Thin Blue Line.'' `` I do n't think any of those movies would have happened without ` American Playhouse,''' said <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, the series' executive producer. In an age of soaring production costs and diminishing underwriting, the `` American Playhouse'' formula stands as a cost-efficient programming breakthrough. For the investment of about $ 500,000, <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> not only obtains movies costing as much as $ 4 million, but it also enjoys all of the publicity the movies generate in their theatrical runs. `` The Thin Blue Line'' is a case in point. The cinematically inventive documentary, directed by <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, centers on a prisoner's 12-year effort to clear himself in the murder of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer. As <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> tells the story, there are a number of questions about the guilt of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, serving a life sentence for the 1976 murder of officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. The possible culprit, as the film implies, is drifter <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a career criminal who was the star prosecution witness against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The movie has gathered glowing reviews, fairly brisk box-office business and a petition drive aimed at clearing <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' name The documentary will not appear on PBS for at least a year _ that, too, is part of the deal. But if it continues to receive the acclaim it now attracts, `` The Thin Blue Line'' will arrive on public television with a built-in audience and be a hit. `` The biggest problem that we have is n't that we do n't have good programs,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>' senior vice president for programming. `` We have terrific programs. It's that nobody ever knows about them. ... Every once in a while, though, we do one of the these -LRB- movies -RRB-, and the word gets out. So it's a great way of getting some attention.'' At the start, public television stations were somewhat less impressed with the concept. `` When we first released ` Testament' and ` <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON>,' the stations were actually quite upset because both films were very well-received,'' said Law. `` And the stations knew they had invested money in the movies and yet it was playing down the street from their station, and they could n't put it on the air. `` And we kept saying, ` Listen. This will pay off. These two titles will be known to people when we put them on television.'.. And ` Testament' and ` <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>' had twice ` American Playhouse's' normal audience The financing idea was born, in part, out of the inability of `` American Playhouse'' to attract the kind of talent its producers hoped it would lure. `` A lot of very interesting writers and directors who we thought might come running did not,'' Law said. `` What they dreamt of spending their time and talent on was feature films, not television. They very much grew up in that generation where the Golden Age of television was not part of their background. The television that was part of their background was something not really worth the time or effort,'' Law said. One upcoming project on the `` American Playhouse'' movie schedule is `` Bloodhounds of Broadway,'' starring <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> and costing around $ 4 million. `` If I were making ` Bloodhounds of Broadway' just for television, there's no way I could have ever got it made,'' Law said. `` But since it was going to be a feature film first, I could go to feature film sources for financing who would not normally finance something for television.'' And, in the end, the viewers of `` American Playhouse'' enjoy the savings.

<DATELINE>PACK CREEK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Across 20 feet of ankle-deep water, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON> stares at a brown bear sow. The bear stares back. She scratches her side, then lunges at Land. He fills the shrinking gap with a pink cloud of hot-pepper aerosol, a sort of natural tear gas, and the bear wheels back to her side of the stream. Again she scratches. Finally she ambles off across the tidal flat. Land backsteps up the gravel spit he was defending, then turns to the three people waiting a dozen steps behind him. `` She did n't mean it,'' he says. `` She was n't serious.'' Land shrugs off such confrontations as part of his job with the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game, enforcing an uneasy truce between man and bear at one of the few places where the species willingly meet. Pack Creek flows into a narrow ocean inlet from a steep valley on <LOCATION> Admiralty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. The island boasts the greatest density in the world of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> brown bears, a larger version of the grizzly species. Late each summer, about 30 bears congregate at <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, splashing through the shallows after spawning salmon and grazing in the surrounding meadow like a herd of cows. The interlopers, game officials say, are the increasing numbers of wildlife watchers whose eagerness to capture bears on film is crowding this corner of wilderness. Pack Creek is one of only three observatories in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> where people can readily watch brown bears. The two others are so popular the state has a visitor limit at one and a lottery for permits to the other. Now <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> is being overwhelmed. Up to 60 people a day hunker on the gravel spit. Yachts congregate offshore; <PERSON> bush </PERSON> planes buzz in and out steadily. In 1981, 100 people came to <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. Last year the visits topped 990. Until this year visitors and bears chased each other around the meadow at <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, the people in pursuit of photographic trophies, the bears guarding prime spots on the salmon stream. But gradually, the bears have grown bolder, and less intimidated by humans. They have chased people off the spit and carried away packs and food. Biologists learned from maulings at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and other parks which once had garbage dumps that bears become most dangerous when they associate people with food. `` We think we have a bomb there and it's ticking,'' says <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director for the <ORGANIZATION> Admiralty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> backs a plan, designed by the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and state game officials, to designate the spit as human turf and leave the rest of <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> to the bears. The authorities hope the boundary will keep people from being mauled and bears from being killed. A few bear-watchers are furious. `` The bears are all used to people and they're busy fishing. They do n't mind you,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillinghast </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> attorney who visited the creek one recent weekend. <PERSON> Tillinghast </PERSON> said it used to be easy to come away from <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> with a standard prize: `` Mom and cubs with a 50-millimeter lens.. and you did n't have any babysitter from Fish and Game watching you either.'' The bear that lunged at Land _ called `` Pest'' with reason _ prompted the new rule. In 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> letter file grew fat with reports of bold advances by bears along the creek, mostly Pest: _ Three wildlife watchers reported Pest circled them chomping and growling, then jumped toward them. She was turned away by hot-pepper spray. _ A <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> man told the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> he was chased into the loft of a woodshed. `` The only reason that I did not shoot was that there was a similar problem yesterday'' and the bear did not attack, he wrote. _ Tourists abandoned a pizza on the spit while fleeing from an approaching bear. A researcher recorded the bear's reward, down to the cheese hanging from its snout and paws. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> staffers at <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> pleaded with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to do something. `` None of us wants to see Pest killed, but we feel some action must be taken soon to prevent more incidents,'' they wrote, suggesting the creek be closed to people. In July 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game announced Pest would be killed. When the anticipated roar of protest came, they began work on the less drastic plan adopted this year. Enter <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, an irascible 88-year-old who loathes government officials on principal and who has become a rallying point for others opposed to this particular government plan. Price built his cabin and floated it onto the remote banks of <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> more than 30 years ago. In the decades since, he has shared the creek with dozens of bears and raised orphan cubs. `` It burns me up,'' Price says of the new rules, which he feels allow game officials to harass the animals. `` I ca n't say what a bear's worth. I ca n't say what a bear's good for. But I know they were here before we were.'' He reports little conflict with the bears that wander into his cabins and woodsheds. Price calls them tame and says he was injured by a bear only once, when he mistook a strange animal for a familiar one and was swatted on the shoulder as he approached. Price believes the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and Fish and Game have trumped up tales of danger so people will believe they need official protection at <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. Then in the name of safety the agencies can charge admission and turn the creek into a money-making <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, he says. Price knows the bears by name and lineage and becomes distraught at thoughts they might be shot or relocated. State and federal officials have said that if the boundary system does n't work they will relocate Pest and, if she returns to <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and causes trouble, she'll be killed. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> hopes to exercise some crowd control, too, by limiting commercial tours, which now account for more than half the visitors. Officials are considering a fee to cover the government cost of monitoring <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, estimated at more than $ 20,000 a year. They say there's no intent, as Price suggested, of making a profit. Someday, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> predicts, there'll be need for an observatory where hundreds of people can go to watch the bears' annual fishing binge. But it wo n't be at <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. `` If there are such viewing areas,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says, `` they probably should n't be in wilderness.''

<HEAD>Southern Baptist Moderates Huddle on Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Restraint tempered desperate words at a strategy session of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> moderates about `` where we go'' in a denomination now run by fundamentalists. `` We are Baptists in a denomination that has stopped being Baptist,'' said <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> <PERSON> Godsey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mercer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The 900 moderate leaders of the coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, made no move at their meeting in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, last weekend to quit the 14.7-million-member denomination, although some speculated it eventually could happen. For the time being, however, participants took lesser measures, launching such independent projects as alternative Sunday school lessons and theological education. They keenly lamented the control achieved by fundamentalists over the denomination, the country's largest Protestant body It `` is wounded and just may be mortally wounded,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Lolley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said, `` We now exist in a state of grief, grief over loss of our mother denomination.'' Its historic principles `` are in eclipse,'' <PERSON> Godsey </PERSON> said. `` In the midst of these dreadful and frightening shadows of denominational eclipse we huddle together to find reassurance and light enough to sustain us.'' The three-day meeting was called after fundamentalists last June won denominational rule for the 10th straight year. They insist on a literal view of the Bible as `` inerrant'' _ free of error historically, scientifically and religiously. Moderates allow for diverse interpretations. The fundamentalist wing gradually has gained sway over church institutions through the appointive powers of a succession of fundamentalist presidents, the latest being the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Sizing up the present status of moderates, the Rev <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, told the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> meeting, `` We have been put out of the house. The game goes on, but we do n't get to play.'' The alliance has 36,460 members, including individuals and member churches, in 38 states. Its board voted to publish independent adult Sunday school lessons beginning in January, for those dissatisfied with materials put out by the denominational <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The alliance also decided to support a House of Baptist studies at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a Methodist institution in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The moderates alloted $ 30,000 to support various causes purportedly spurned by the fundamentalist administration, such as peace making, housing for the poor, women in ministry and the doctrine of priesthood of the believer. Moderates criticized several recent denominational actions under fundamentalist control, including: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s prohibition of support to female pastors or divorced persons as missionaries. _ The foreign mission board's dismissal of a missionary, the Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Willett </PERSON>, accusing him of `` doctrinal ambiguity'' for not holding a literalistic view of some miracles. _ A funding cut for the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, a religious liberty watchdog agency in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> involving eight Baptist denominations. _ Tightened control over the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, resulting in resignations of the president, most top administrators and some faculty. The alliance's interim executive director, the Rev. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization is not planning a new denomination but also is not ruling out that possibility. `` The future is uncertain,'' he said. `` The alliance will remain active in its support for Baptist principles and the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> heritage of freedom until what we perceive as designed, concentrated, calculated oppression is relieved. `` We are simply trying to provide an arena for people who have been selected out, prevented, prohibited, blackballed by those in power to have a place to stand and can have some free air to breathe.'' A straw poll at the meeting found 90 percent of the participants favored some change in relation to the denomination's `` cooperative program'' through which various agencies are financed. Several particpants favored continued support for that unified budget, but also creation of foundations to finance causes not backed by the denomination but deemed important to moderates. Others favored `` designated giving'' only to chosen denominational programs, with moderates putting other funds in escrow until fundamentalists agree to political changes in bylaws that enable factional control. The proposals were to be considered at an alliance board meeting scheduled for Nov. 28-29 in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter the skyline of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, previously dismissed as sterile and nondescript. Even homegrown architect <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, whose glass towers and soaring atriums for years defined <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and who in the past criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office building planned for downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> started last fall with the opening of the 50-story <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> building. Officially called One <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, it is a slender, post-modern tower of stone with tall arched entryways and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high, eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern. Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words like `` gracious,'' `` truly wonderful,'' `` serene,'' `` imposing'' and `` glamorous'' to describe the tower. `` It certainly projects a vibrance to the rest of the world,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, vice president for economic development with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just beautiful. Everybody's just staggered by it. The tower is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of the city's tallest buildings. Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going up in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper complex was altered to complement the rose-colored <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> tower. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON>, whose firm designed the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> building with design consultant <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, wo n't take credit for transforming <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s skyline. But he said the city's image, as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change. `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has been looking for its identity,'' <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` It's an historical city -LRB- but -RRB- its architecture and image is not strictly historical. You think of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and you think of ` Gone With The Wind.' Now, there is an attempt to come up with a visual image. `` We all know <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, but you do n't think of its buildings,'' he said. `` Like in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Empire State Building; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> building; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> TransAmerica </ORGANIZATION> building. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> does n't have that. It's moving toward that, very definitely.'' <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Another planned project grouped in the `` Son of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'' building spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section, a complex of three office buildings and a hotel being developed by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the excitement over the nearby <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, its architects, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ventulett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stainback </PERSON>, redrew the plans to use rose glass above rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire. The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, whose imprint is already deeply felt in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, primarily through the <ORGANIZATION> Peachtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the towering cylindrical Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>'s new building is slated to begin construction next year and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> as the Southeast's tallest building Unveiling the design in May, <PERSON> Portman </PERSON> said it was `` respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern architecture.'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durfee </PERSON>, a professor of architecture at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, said completion of the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> tower signaled the acceleration of a change in the look of the city that began a decade ago. `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was pretty much plain vanilla,'' he said, `` with no development of architectural significance.'' <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON> echoed that appraisal, saying, `` It was pretty nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you -LRB- to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> -RRB- blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you would n't have a clue where you are.'' <PERSON> Durfee </PERSON> said that 10 years ago, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was groping to form an identity and had no demand for the type of buildings now are going up. Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office buildings, <PERSON> Durfee </PERSON> said, and corporate sponsorship of building projects has changed the rules of skyscraper financing. Some say that all the building activity simply makes good business sense. `` Sure, there's competitive prestige. Good architecture is good business,'' said <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartshorn </PERSON>, chairman of the geography department at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist in urban affairs. A good-looking building, he said, `` is easier to sell to the financing people as well as the tenants.'' <PERSON> Hartshorn </PERSON> said he expects the new projects in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will bring special recognition. `` I think it's going to open some eyes,'' he said. `` We have prestige with our cultural buildings, but I do n't know that our office buildings are that distinctive nationally. `` These are n't just ultra post-modern. They're classic. They're different.

<HEAD>Greek Island of Patmos Holds Out Against Nudity and Nightclubs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PATMOS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nightclubs and nudity are banned on this island where tradition holds that St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> wrote the New Testament's Book of Revelation in a cave overlooking the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Under a special government decree, <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> has a unique status among <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s 200 or so inhabited islands as a `` holy island'' still dominated by its 900-year-old Byzantine monastery. `` We prefer our visitors to be pilgrims rather than ordinary tourists and we would like them to respect our tradition,'' <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON> <PERSON> Isidoros </PERSON>, who heads the 30-member community at the Monastery of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Theologian, said in an interview. But plans for an airport coupled with widespread publicity for the monastery's 900th anniversary celebrations are expected to bring mass tourism to <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> in the coming years. The tranquillity of <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION>, a rocky outcrop in the Dodecanese group of islands with around 2,000 residents, attracts wealthy Greeks and foreigners who have restored scores of traditional mansions clustered beneath the monastery's gray fortress-like walls. Many have given donations to the monastery, to help maintain its library of rare manuscripts and early books, along with a collection of priceless icons _ portraits of saints painted in gold and bright colors. `` <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> is still a place apart, with a unique atmosphere. Unlike other islands, a conscious effort has been made to protect it,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Constantinides </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> antiques dealer with a family home there. Signs in Greek, French, German or English scattered around the island's beaches point out that nudity is not allowed. One disco operates on a remote bay, but the narrow alleys around the monastery fall silent by 10 p.m., even in summer. `` People sometimes go topless on the beaches, but ... on the whole the rules are respected,'' said <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyrozis </PERSON>, the island's doctor and also its mayor. The development project planned by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s state tourist organization EOT, together with the monastery and town authorities, calls for construction of an airport, zoning for new hotels and bungalows and improved harbor facilities. `` Past experience shows that once an island gets an airport, mass tourism is very difficult to avoid,'' said <PERSON> Eleni </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonou </PERSON>, who heads the project. `` But an airport is essential because it serves the islanders first.'' More than 30,000 visitors come to <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> every year, but two-thirds of them arrive aboard cruise ships that steam away before sunset after a few hours' stay. On an island too barren to grow its own food, visitors are the only source of income apart from fishing. `` There's a delicate balance to be kept between God and mammon on this island,'' Mayor <PERSON> Kyrozis </PERSON> said. `` There has to be tourism, but not so much it kills what we have to offer.'' Trained for a more secluded life, the monks say it's already hard work taking turns to supervise the tourists swarming through the monastery museum, its frescoed chapels and stone colonnades. `` The sheer numbers of people coming through mean that we're exhausted by the time the season's over and there's time to get on with our own tasks,'' said <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON>, the monastery librarian The tourists also crowd into the Monastery of the Apocalypse, built over the cave where <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> supposedly wrote his visionary work while exiled on <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> around A.D. 95. `` It's historical fact that St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> was on the island,'' said <PERSON> Athanassios </PERSON> <PERSON> Kominis </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of Byzantine studies. `` The tradition that he wrote Revelation there is certainly more than speculation, but not quite certainty,'' Patriarch <PERSON> Dimitrios </PERSON>, spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> worldwide, plans to lead Orthodox, Roman Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churchmen in a two-day international pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> Sept. 25-26. It celebrates the 900th birthday of the Monastery of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1088 by a Byzantine scholar, the Blessed Christodoulos with special permission from the Emperor <PERSON> Alexius </PERSON> <PERSON> Comnenos </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Texas Experts Downplay Impact of Recent Oil Price Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A few years back the prospect of $ 14 a barrel oil sent shivers down many a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> spine, but state economists and oil analysts are shrugging off the possible effects of the recent slide in oil prices to near two-year lows. Optimists might attribute the change in attitude to a diversification of the state's economy since the great oil bust of 1986. But analysts say the main reason for the change is that oil companies have grown so lean since then that prices would have to drop considerably further to wreak more short-term havoc with the industry and the state's economy. Oil futures slipped below $ 14 per barrel this week before surging back a bit after King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> called for better cooperation among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. The October contract for delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 7 cents to settle at $ 14.56 a barrel on Tuesday. The October contract had skidded as low as $ 13.75 during Monday's trading, marking the lowest level since Oct. 29, 1986, before rebounding. On spot markets, crude prices also are below $ 14.50. Despite the dwindling `` upstream'' profits from drilling and production, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> refineries are profitably working around the clock. And the integrated oil companies have streamlined enough to make up for the low price of crude with the relatively firm price of refined products. `` The energy industry is just as important as it once was, but if you look at the region and the composition of industry, it's a much smaller share,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Michot </PERSON> <PERSON> Foss </PERSON>, senior associate at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s Rice Center. `` Not that the others have grown so much, but because the oil industry has gotten smaller.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy has grown less dependent on oil tax revenue: the state had a $ 113 million budget surplus in the 1988 fiscal year despite continuing problems in the oilpatch. In fiscal 1987, the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had to raise taxes to cover a $ 5.7 billion deficit and meet a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> figures indicate the estimated statewide civilian workforce in oil and gas extraction declined by 57,700 jobs between December 1985 and December 1986, to 184,500 from 242,200. The <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area lost about 160,000 jobs of all types during the first major drop in oil prices in 1982-83, and an additional 130,000 jobs disappeared in the 1986 price plunge, officials said. `` Our short-term dependency on oil during this recovery, oddly enough, is not that great. But the state's long-term dependency is significant,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Perryman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' gradual economic recovery, he said, has been driven primarily by export industries, including petrochemicals, paper, aircraft and electronics. `` I think that a year from today, if the price of oil stays at that level, the economic outlook in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will be lower than otherwise,'' <PERSON> Perryman </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't think we're going to have any significant problems unless the price drops below the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> production levels of $ 11.50 a barrel and stays there.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Proffitt </PERSON>, a spokesman for State Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, also said a sustained depression in oil prices would hurt the state economy, but the industry's importance had declined in recent years. He noted that oil and gas revenue accounted for only 9 percent of state economic activity, compared with as much as 27 percent at one time. The comptroller's office reported $ 490.5 million in oil tax revenue during the 1988 fiscal year and projected $ 531.7 million in 1989 revenue. The estimated figure may have to be lowered if prices continue dropping, <PERSON> Proffitt </PERSON> said. Many analysts predict continuing softness in the market, although there is widespread belief that current low levels are temporary. However, there is fear that even short-term dips could have a chilling effect on the industry and score a psychological blow to the optimism needed in a recovering economy. `` I've already seen some indications of companies making decisions that are a little more conservative than they would have been otherwise,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, senior consultant at the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Purvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gertz </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This price drop is certainly nowhere near the same magnitude as what happened in 1986, but I think it's reminding people of that,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who is predicting moderate price increases in late 1988. `` Some people were starting to get a little complacent with the price up a little bit, and this is a reminder that that low price atmosphere is certainly still with us.''

 Boxing champ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s image has taken some lumps outside the ring in the past few weeks, and some advertising consultants say it may cost him lucrative commercial work. `` Nobody wants to lose the customers they already have, and all the negative stuff with him is a way to lose customers,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolmer </PERSON>, who heads a firm that advises advertisers on signing celebrities for commercials. Since dispatching <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> in a 91-second bout for the heavyweight chasmpionship in June, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has gone through a rancorous court battle with his manager, engaged in a street fight with a former opponent and survived a car crash that one newspaper reported _ and <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> denied _ was an attempted suicide. Those incidents offer a contrast to the cheery and confident guy who appeared in three <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepsi </PERSON> commercials this past summer, in which the soda maker touted <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepsi </PERSON> as `` undisputed champs.'' In one of the ads, the champ took a soft drink from the refrigerator while his wife, actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, playfully snapped a towel at him. The ads were so popular that <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ran them for two months instead of the one month originally planned, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said the Tyson ads were last run in late August. The company now is using ads featuring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup yachtsman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>. He said recent publicity about <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had no bearing on the decision to quit using the Tyson Diet Pepsi ads. `` They had run their course,'' <PERSON> Mackenzie </PERSON> said. He said there never had been any talk of a longer-term relation with <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, who reportedly was paid $ 1.25 million for his work. But <PERSON> Kolmer </PERSON>, who was not involved in negotiating <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s appearance in the ads, speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> had an option to continue to use Tyson in its ads but chose not to do so `` In effect, he has been fired. They can phrase it any way they want to,'' he said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s manager, said the reports about <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had hurt the boxer's image, but insisted that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had been a `` victim of circumstance'' who would be able over time to improve his image. <PERSON> Cayton </PERSON> said that meanwhile, he had `` put on hold'' his talks with a battery maker and an electronics company about having <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> appear in commercials for them. He refused to identify the companies. `` I'm not pushing at this time,'' <PERSON> Cayton </PERSON> said. `` It's not the best negotiating atmosphere. I want this unfair wave to subside before I proceed.'' <PERSON> Cayton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> is `` the best fighter in the world today'' and said he was confident <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> `` will go on to bigger and better things in every area.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> signed one-year contracts within the past few months to appear in ads in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Suntory </ORGANIZATION> beer and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> vehicles, <PERSON> Cayton </PERSON> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Redmont, Wash.-based video games maker, signed <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> 13 months ago to a two-year contract to appear in ads for `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s Punch-Out,'' which has proven one of its best-selling products. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said there had been no discussion of canceling the agreement. He said the Tyson game was not currently being advertised, however, because the company normally pitches only its new releases with advertising. <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanktree </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celebrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said she views <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> as `` a celebrity who has transcended his sport'' and expects he will weather the recent controversy. `` His career is by no means over as an endorsement candidate,'' she said. But <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON>, who advises advertisers on use of sports celebrities, said `` the advertising industry by nature is a conservative industry.'' `` Certain behavior may be more acceptable in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> than it is in the heartland,'' he said. `` We are advising clients to proceed with caution.''

 A professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has developed what the school says is a faster way of measuring food deterioration, which could reduce the need for preservatives and help cut food manufacturing costs. The method combines previously known scientific tools with computer technology and lets researchers measure food shelf life within hours, compared with the weeks or years it used to take, school officials said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> has applied for a patent for the process, which can be applied to dried goods such as cookies, fruit, breakfast cereal, instant coffee and milk powder, said <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. The roots of the process date to more than 10 years ago, when <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, an internationally known food-packaging expert and long-time <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> professor, found a way of measuring how food absorbs potential carcinogens from packaging. His findings were applied worldwide. He began using the same technology five years ago to find out how food breaks down, and since then has been working on the problem with a team of almost 20 graduate students. The key to determining shelf life is discovering how the water interacts with food, he said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 74, illustrates his case with the bagel, which turns hard after a few days but regains its softness when toasted. The starch and proteins push out the water and crystalize, hardening the food, but heating the bagel reverses the process, he said. `` This is part of the research I've been doing, to see how the water redistributed itself,'' he said. The technique _ known as inverse gas chromatography _ essentially measures a product's potential for absorbing and losing water. Samples are put in a chromatography column, a sensitive instrument that measures how the water interacts with the food, and a computer is used to quickly analyze the resulting data. `` It's a kind of tool for the development of new products and also to do quality control on existing products,'' <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said. By knowing how long food will last, manufacturers can offer consumers fresher products and reduce costs and waste. They also may be able to reduce the use of preservatives, <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> researchers say. `` It wo n't eliminate the need for preservatives but it will give a better feel for when a preservative is needed,'' <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said. The accuracy of current methods of determining shelf life varies, scientists say. Methods range from putting items on a shelf and waiting several years to see how long they last to accelerating the aging process by raising the temperature. `` My method works in standard temperatures but I use very small amounts of material and an apparatus that's very sensitive so I can measure very small rates of change,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone, millions of dollars worth of food are lost to spoilage each year, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s research center in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Other scientists declined to comment on <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s technique on the grounds that they did not have enough information. `` I've never heard of anything like this before,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research leader in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` It sounds very original. It also sounds very difficult, but perhaps promising.'' <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clydesdale </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, said `` I think it's an interesting application -LRB- of the technology -RRB- but it is n't going to change the color of the sky.''

<HEAD>Nation's Biggest Grocery Chain Braced Against Takeover Threats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest grocery chain, has proposed a $ 3.8 billion restructuring plan to shield itself against any hostile takeover bids. The Cincinnati-based company said Tuesday it was considering a plan that would make <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> an unattractive takeover target by raising its stock price, loading it up with new debt, placing 20 percent of its shares under control of its employees and selling off parts of the company. The proposal followed news that the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> received federal antitrust clearance to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock and pushed <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shares sharply higher. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock soared by $ 11.75 a share to $ 51.25 in heavy trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Under the restructuring, shareholders would get a one-time cash dividend of $ 40 per share and would receive long-term bonds worth another $ 8 a share, while retaining their <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> common stock. Based on its 78.57 million common shares outstanding, it would cost about $ 3.15 billion to pay the dividends. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> also would have to borrow another $ 630 million to cover the bonds. `` By continuing as an independent company, the interests of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate would also be protected,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s directors will meet `` in the very near future'' to vote on the plan, company representative <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said. Directors met in emergency session Friday to prepare the protection plan only hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> they could buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock without violating anti-trust laws. The <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> have launched a number of major raids against grocery companies and other retailers, including unsuccessful but profitable hostile bids for <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, Supermarkets General and Stop n' Shop. It was not known how much <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> own, although they must disclose when they acquire 5 percent or more of the company's outstanding shares. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> clearance was the first official sign of the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION>' interest in <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, although <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock has has traded heavily over the past five months amid rumors the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> and other potential acquirers were interested in the company Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> reported sales of almost $ 18 billion in 1987. It operates 1,317 supermarkets nationwide as well as 900 convenience stores, and employs 170,000 people. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said it will repay the debt incurred in the restructuring using cash flow from operations, reducing expenses and selling assets. In a 1986 restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> sold its chain of SupeRx retail drugstores, and <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has worked since July to sell off its unprofitable chain of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Choice supermarkets and liquor stores in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Analysts said the proposed restructuring, if undertaken, probably would be enough to scare off any would-be hostile buyers. The dividend portion of the plan alone would cost $ 377 million a year in interest, assuming a rate of 12 percent, estimated <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Flyg </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, Ohio-based grocery chain that competes with <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. That would exceed <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 pre-tax income of $ 315.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> could raise between $ 800 million and $ 900 million from asset sales, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON>, vice president of the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Rotan-Mosle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Legislation to impose tougher economic sanctions on white-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is under examination by a sharply divided <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, with opponents saying the bill would limit the options of the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was expected to approve the sanctions bill on a narrow, party-line vote today, supporters conceded they had neither the votes to shut off debate on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor nor to override a near-certain veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should the bill pass. The bill, intended as a follow-up to a set of milder sanctions enacted over a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto in 1986, would require an end to most trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business investment from the racially divided nation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved similar legislation on Aug. 11. Republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunity last week to vote on amendments as some <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators said changes might make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose. The 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition of senators from both parties. But only a few Republicans have indicated they are ready to support a stronger set of sanctions, with some contending that a trade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to encourage <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to end the country's system of forced racial separation and control known as apartheid. They also said that adopting the sanctions bill now would foreclose the options of the next president whether he be Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who opposes sanctions, or Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who favors them. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also opposes the legislation, contending its passage might disrupt U.S.-mediated talks among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> aimed at South African withdrawal from the territory of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means of sending a strong signal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing to pay a price to end the apartheid system. They said the issue is a moral one, not political, and that sanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violent revolution inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by moving that country toward multiracial democratic rule.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> has sold his 15 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 137 million, the latest in a string of asset sales by the billionaire takeover strategist. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, sold 7.23 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a major food services company, for $ 19 apiece on Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Drapkin </PERSON>. Last Friday, <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> MacAndrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Technicolor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> film processing business to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Carlton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 780 million. In addition, <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> reportedly has agreed to sell his <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cigar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to a leveraged buyout group for $ 125 million. The moves, which reportedly have raised <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s takeover warchest to about $ 2 billion, have fueled speculation that the accomplished takeover strategist was looking for major targets. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, who acquired Technicolor in 1982, won a bitter takeover fight for <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and has made several, unsuccessful overtures to <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> since late 1986. He has developed a reputation as a builder rather than a speculative corporate raider, boosting profits at <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> and Technicolor during his stewardship of those companies. The sale of a 15 percent chunk of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> also has raised speculation that the food services company might be a takeover target. Stock in <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s fast food chains among others, rose $ 1.62 -LCB- to $ 20.62 -LCB- a share in heavy <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday. <PERSON> Drapkin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> was supportive of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> management, and had not sold his <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> shares to the company.

<HEAD>July Deficit Lowest in Nearly Four Years, Dollar Jumps</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today reported the lowest monthly trade deficit in nearly four years, inciting a hectic rally in the dollar, easing interest rates in the credit markets and boosting the Republican presidential campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the merchandise trade deficit shrank to $ 9.5 billion in July, the lowest monthly imbalance since December 1984 and substantially better than many economists had predicted. The 28 percent improvement reflected a small increase in exports and a big decline in imports. It was certain to cheer Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been trying to deflect charges from Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that the nation's soaring deficits reflect major flaws in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic program. But the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also revised upward its June deficit figure to $ 13.2 billion from $ 12.5 billion, which would be the biggest gap since the February shortfall of $ 14.4 billion. Money traders scrambled to buy dollars after today's report was released, sending the currency sharply higher in value against the West German mark and Japanese yen. In the bond market, a sensitive indicator of inflation and the economy's direction, the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose more than $ 7.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount and its yield fell to 8.98 percent from 8.99 percent late Tuesday. Bond traders were primarily reacting to the big shrinkage in imports, which suggested the economy may be slowing down and thereby easing fears of inflation. The trade report was issued prior to the opening bell on Wall Street, but stock traders already had assumed there would be good news today and drove prices up late Tuesday, encouraged by remarks from <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary designate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing that he expects the trade deficit to decline at a `` surprisingly fast'' pace over the next few years. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that the deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade, shrank to $ 33.3 billion in the second quarter, a 9.8 percent improvement from a first quarter imbalance of $ 36.9 billion. It was the biggest quarterly improvement since a 20.1 percent drop in the final three months of last year. The current account covers trade in merchandise as well as trade in services, which primarily reflect the flow of investment earnings between countries. In other markets Tuesday, oil prices advanced, driven by a rise in wholesale gasoline prices, which soared on news that refineries and oil platforms were threatened by a hurricane approaching the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The contract for October delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 7 cents to settle at $ 14.56 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed up 1.19 cents at 43.81 cents a gallon. Elsewhere, the government released a state-by-state report on unemployment in which <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> emerged as the best job provider for its residents. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> slipped from first place to 10th in the past year among states with the lowest unemployment rates. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> posted an unemployment rate of 2.3 percent in July, with just 6,900 of its workers lacking jobs, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 3.6 percent in July, a full percentage point higher than the same month a year ago.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, suffering sluggish sales and still recovering from the high cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> takeover, reported a $ 100 million loss in the second quarter. A representative of the Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the loss was due to continuing weak retail sales and the costs associated with its $ 8.8 billion takeover of Federated last May. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s second-quarter loss compares with $ 30 million in earnings, or 32 cents a share, in the same period last year. For the period ended July 30, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> reported in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing it had interest costs of $ 132.1 million related to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile takeover of the retailer. Its sales in the period dropped to $ 970.5 million from $ 2.4 billion in the year-ago period, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said previously that costs associated with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s unsuccessful takeover fight contributed to a $ 128 million loss at <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> in the first quarter Despite the lower overall sales, three of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s divisions posted increases in revenue, while two reported declines, due mainly to `` mediocre ready-to-wear sales,'' the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdales </ORGANIZATION> showed a .7 percent increase in sales during the period, Atlanta-based <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s gained .8 percent and Miami-based <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s advanced 1.5 percent.

 The stock market rolled up a broad gain today, responding to better-than-expected news on international trade. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.27 to 2,095.31 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 774 up, 217 down and 446 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 32.10 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's trade deficit shrank to $ 9.53 billion in July from a revised gap of $ 13.22 billion the month before Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a July figure in the $ 11 billion to $ 11.5 billion range.

 Oil futures prices surged in early trading today on a string of bullish factors, including news that a hurricane threatens <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude production along the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coast. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the October contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, was quoted 57 cents higher at $ 15.12 a 42-gallon barrel shortly after the market opened, from Tuesday's settlement price of $ 14.56. Contracts had traded between $ 14.33 a barrel and $ 14.70 a barrel Tuesday after Monday's whiplash session in which prices dropped to a near two-year low of $ 13.75 before rebounding to settle at $ 14.49. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery zoomed 1.94 cents a gallon in early trading to 45.80 cents from Tuesday's close of 43.81 cents a gallon. The October wholesale heating oil contract also was up sharply, trading about 1.22 cents a gallon higher than its close of 41.83 cents a gallon on Tuesday. `` This could be one of the wildest trading days with all the news,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Analysts said today's market was continuing the bullish sentiment started Tuesday on concerns that refineries and oil platforms were being evacuated in anticipation of the approaching storm. `` If the hurricane hits the Gulf coast, there's concern about short-term gasoline supplies,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said that although Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> had not damaged the Gulf oil fields, between 600,000 and 800,000 gallons a day of gasoline could be lost if production was halted to wait out the storm Meanwhile, this morning's market also reacted strongly to an announcement by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> that the cartel's pricing committee had set a meeting date of Sept. 25-26 The announcement generates hope that the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> will call for a full meeting of the cartel to set production limits and curb the ouput that has flooded world oil markets and eroded prices, analysts said. Meanwhile, oil brokers were saying this week that the recent dip in oil prices had not affected retail prices yet but by winter consumers could realize some benefits at the pump. `` If we see another $ 2 slide in -LRB- oil -RRB- prices, then consumer gasoline prices could be expected to go 7 to 8 cents lower when it's all over _ by Thanksgiving,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Other oil brokers said that if crude prices remained between the $ 13.50 and $ 15.50 levels in the next several weeks, retail gasoline prices could decline by about 2 cents a gallon

<TEXT>
 Somebody at the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forgot to look at the calendar _ and the goof could cost the government as much as $ 100 million in taxes. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> confirmed today that it was one day late in filing a notice of appeal in an important case _ an appeal that some legal experts expect the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would have won. An agency spokesman disputed the estimate of what the error could cost. On May 26, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> entered a decision holding that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> was wrong in requiring <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to pay tax currently on customer security deposits. Under the law, the agency had 90 days to appeal, a period that ended Aug. 24. The notice of appeal was filed Aug. 25. `` Underscoring this embarrassment is the fact that the service prevailed in the only appellate decision addressing the issue presented in the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T case,'' reported Tax Notes, an authoritative tax journal. The publication noted a previous appeals court verdict in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> case involving security deposits paid by gas customers. A similar case, involving deposits paid to <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has been appealed by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the error in the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T case, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said today, `` IRS has no intention of abandoning its position on customer deposits.'' Tax Notes estimated the goof could cost $ 100 million in disputed taxes and interest. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> contended, however, that because the issue is essentially one of when taxes should be paid, the potential loss would be less.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its star high-yield bond trader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> have issued wide-ranging subpoenas for evidence to defend themselves against the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s massive fraud case. Notice of some of the subpoenas, filed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court, reflected the investment firm's intention to undertake an aggressive defense against the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> civil charges announced last week after a nearly two-year probe stemming from the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. Unlike restrictive pretrial fact-finding rules for defendants in criminal cases, defendants in civil suits enjoy broad subpoena rights to seek testimony and other evidence used in the accusations against them. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and three other employees of the firm were accused by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> of scheming with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to profit on insider trading, manipulate stock, cheat clients, keep phony books and other fraudulent acts. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> suit also named <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, his son <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and a Posner-controlled company, <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Those subpoenaed by the defense do n't yet include <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the one-time Wall Street speculator and imprisoned insider trader who negotiated a plea-bargain cooperation agreement with the government and implicated <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the others It was unclear why the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> team of defense lawyers have not yet sought testimony from <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flumenbaum </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> attorney identified as the lead lawyer in the subpoena notice, did not return telephone calls for comment. Regardless of whether <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s testimony is sought, lawyers familiar with the case have predicted the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, which has been conducting a criminal probe of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, would likely move to nullify any <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> subpoena on grounds it could compromise the investigation According to the defense notice filed in court, those subpoenaed include investment businesses once linked to <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, several <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> art galleries once patronized by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, as well as the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of Fried, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, which helped negotiate his plea agreement. Defense lawyers also are seeking any audio or video tape recordings held by the government in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case. There has been speculation that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> secretly taped discussions with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> while cooperating with the government in 1986, before the announcement that he would settle <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> insider trading charges by paying $ 100 million in illicit profits and fines, as well as plead guilty to a criminal charge. The court notice did n't identify other recipients of subpoenas. But the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified people it said were familiar with the case as saying they included numerous potential witnesses, including former employees of Boesky-controlled organizations.

 The public wants larger, more powerful cars, and tighter fuel economy standards would result in lost jobs, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today in a federal hearing on the gasoline mileage rules. `` This regulation flies against the basic forces of economics,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimisch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental activities executive director. `` The consumer is reacting to gasoline prices which are lower than anyone expected, so the consumer does not rank fuel economy as a top priority.'' Environmentalists, also testifying at the hearing, said in a news conference Tuesday that looser fuel-economy standards would contribute to environmental damage, including a warming of the global climate. The hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was taking public comment on a proposal to set the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standard at 26.5 miles per gallon to 27.5 mpg. Without the new rule, the standard would revert to the 27.5 mpg voted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. It has been set at 26 mpg since 1986 under an exception allowed by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. The fuel-economy law, adopted to reduce imported petroleum consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices, sets a maximum level of fuel consumption each automaker's fleet of passenger cars, on average, must meet. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s customers choose cars in part based on gasoline prices, and with the price at the pump running below $ 1 per gallon in much of the nation, car buyers see little value in features that save fuel, <PERSON> Klimisch </PERSON> said. Should the standard be placed at 27.5 mpg, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would be forced to cut back on large-car production at its <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, plant at a cost of 60,000 jobs to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and its suppliers in 1989 and 110,000 jobs in 1990, <PERSON> Klimisch </PERSON> said. Car buyers, faced with a shortage of higher-powered <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars, would buy from foreign automakers, buy light trucks that come under different standards or drive older, less fuel-efficient cars longer, <PERSON> Klimisch </PERSON> said. Eventually, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> might be forced to increase the percentage of foreign-made parts in its cars to meet the demands of the marketplace, he said. The automaker estimates it might be able to meet a standard of about 27.1 mpg without job losses, but to make sure of that, in light of the uncertainties of sales forecasts and test results, it needs a standard of 26.7 mpg or less, he said. A coalition of 20 environmental groups called for stiffening of the standards to avoid contributing to global warming. `` If you liked this summer's heat and droughts, you'll love the results of this policy,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, international program director of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` In view of what the scientists are telling us about global warming, it is hard to imagine a more irresponsible proposal.'' Researchers have predicted that manmade emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will raise the average global temperature significantly during the next century, causing changes in weather patterns, crop growth and increased sea levels from polar melting. Carbon dioxide tends to trap heat in the atmosphere rather than allowing it to radiate back into space, a phenomenon called the `` greenhouse effect.'' Automobiles account for about 25 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emissions of carbon dioxide, <PERSON> Stoel </PERSON> said. `` If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto fleet could be brought up to an average of 45 mpg by the year 2005, this one action would reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carbon dioxide emissions by about 15 percent,'' he said. Loosening the standard from 27.5 mpg to 26 mpg would increase carbon dioxide emissions over the estimated 106,000-mile life of each affected car by about 1.6 tons or 4 percent, according to figures presented by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The copper-mining town of <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION> has come to symbolize the birth of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s nationalist spirit in the 82 years since a bloody strike pitted Mexican workers against an American mine owner. Today a new generation of Cananea miners says a government plan to return the nationalized, but debt-ridden copper company to the private sector is like selling a historical landmark. `` This is a national patrimony. We feel it in our souls,'' said <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, general secretary of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> 65, representing 3,000 workers at <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state. Under a plan to reduce government subsidies and help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> overcome its severe economic crisis, the administration of President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has sold many nonessential state-owned companies, most of them money losers. The sale of the <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION> mine would be by far the biggest transfer undertaken, but it now appears a final decision will be up to <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, due to take office as president in December. Since the failure of a $ 910 million bid by <ORGANIZATION> Protexa </ORGANIZATION>, based in this northern industrial city, the development bank handling the sale said the government has received no new offers. In a written response to a list of questions directed to its <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> headquarters, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiera </ORGANIZATION> bank said Cananea now could be sold as a package deal along with another <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> copper mining operation, <ORGANIZATION> Mexicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cobre </ORGANIZATION>. Unofficial reports say the government will ask for $ 2 billion for the two mines, but <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> said that the union opposes the sale. `` They can sell a company, but they ca n't sell workers,'' he said, adding that some potential buyers want to purchase the mine without the union contract. The <ORGANIZATION> Cananea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was founded by American entrepeneur <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> in 1899. According to `` The Labor Struggle in Cananea 1906,'' published by the <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state government, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> ran the mine as an American fiefdom. `` The Mexican workers at <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION> were discontented because of the inequalities that existed between them and the foreign workers at the same company ... They also found themselves restricted, almost without exception, to the most arduous and worst paid jobs,'' the book said. On June 1, 1906, 2,000 Mexican miners rallying under the slogan `` Five pesos -LRB- then $ 10 -RRB- for eight hours work'' went on strike. On June 2, according to the book, `` North Americans barricaded in the main offices ... fired indiscriminately at the Mexicans.'' Mexican police and soldiers aided by <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rangers </ORGANIZATION> put down the rebellion June 5 and jailed its surviving leaders. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Trueva </PERSON>, a writer who is compiling a history of the Cananea labor movement, said estimates of the death toll range from 11 to more than 100, including Americans. The Mexican dead are remembered throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> each Labor Day with shouts of, `` We will not forget the martyrs of Cananea.'' Although at least 25 labor strikes broke out between 1905 and 1908, the Cananea strike often is credited with sparking the Mexican labor movement and with helping to launch the Mexican Revolution of 1910. In <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION>, a town of 25,000 people today, a local junior high school is named `` The Martyrs of 1906'' and two monuments stand in memory of those who died. The Mexican government, which has controlled the operations since the 1970s, launched a multimillion-dollar expansion project before the onset of the economic crisis in 1982, said company spokesman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>. Those expenditures, steady devaluations in the peso and the low price of copper on the international market helped put <ORGANIZATION> Cananea </ORGANIZATION>'s total debt at the equivalent of $ 1 billion today, according to company figures published in the August national business magazine Expansion But now the improvements are complete, the price of copper is back up over $ 1 a pound and Cananea's sales are soaring. In 1987 the company had net earnings of $ 23.3 million on sales of $ 186.5 million, a 300 percent increase from the year before, according to Expansion. <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> estimated production this year at 125,652 metric tons of pure copper. <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> said the government has treated workers better than any of the private owners, who he said `` carried off everything and left us nothing.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON>, `` Now that it's making money they want to sell it. We hope they do n't find any buyers.''

 The stock market edged upward today in a lukewarm response to better-than-expected news on international trade. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points in the early going, showed a 3.20 gain at 2,086.24 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 702 up, 561 down and 539 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's trade deficit shrank to $ 9.53 billion in July from a revised gap of $ 13.22 billion the month before Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a July figure in the $ 11 billion to $ 11.5 billion range. Of particular note, brokers said, was a substantial drop in imports. That was taken as a sign that the momentum of the domestic economy was slowing in response to recent credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. A moderation of economic growth would presumably allow the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to pursue a less restrictive credit policy, encouraging steady to lower interest rates.

<TEXT>
 American business is picking up a strong message: You can sell to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It may not be easy, but it's not impossible. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is heavily promoting an export drive as a major component of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's strategy to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, especially with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which had a $ 60 billion surplus in trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. The dollar's drop over the past three years has helped by making Japanese goods more expensive to buy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but if the Japanese do not buy more U.S.-made products, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit will never disappear. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> led executives of 25 American consumer-products companies to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over the past week to promote their entry into the Japanese market. The trip appears to have met with some success. `` The experience has been very enlightening, to say the least,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastpak </ORGANIZATION>, said of his look at the fashion luggage market in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We never really intended to get into exporting in this stage of our development,'' he said, describing his Boston-based company's growth as averaging 35 percent a year for 11 years while concentrating mostly on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for fashionable bags. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said his company had noticed some Japanese travelers had bought <ORGANIZATION> Eastpak </ORGANIZATION> goods and then reordered. `` We thought at first we were selling because of style but were over-priced,'' he said. But after spending a few days looking at the market in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, he said, `` I was very surprised to find we are very price-competitive.'' The Verity-led mission was <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' first trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. `` This has opened up a brand new horizon to us, and we're going to be back as often as it takes.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' reaction to Japanese price levels is typical of first-time <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors. Calculated in today's devalued dollars, everything is expensive here. But the Japanese are used to current prices in yen, since this country has negligible inflation, and many people have incomes high enough to sustain luxury buying by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards. At a meeting with reporters last weekend, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said he was leading the trade mission to alert more American businesses to the opportunity in exporting. American companies are not oriented to the world market because they think they are doing well enough in the big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, he said. `` If you feel we're hand-holding, you're right,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. He said he hoped to see the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit down 15 percent to 20 percent in 1988. `` That is what our export-promotion program is all about,'' he said, predicting that in the coming years the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy will be driven by exports. Some significant improvement in trade has already been registered, according to the latest figures released by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit shrank to $ 9.5 billion in July, the lowest monthly imbalance since December 1984. The dramatic 28 percent improvement in the trade deficit reflected a small increase in exports and a big decline in imports. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said he was disappointed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> construction companies had not shown much interest in the opening that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bargained hard to win on major construction projects in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But he predicted they would jump into the market when they saw Japanese contracts going to other foreign countries. During <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s week-long mission, the <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> jewelry firm opened a shop in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, makers of recreational vehicles, got a lavish promotional party for its linkup with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which will market Iowa-manufactured Winnebago vehicles in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Other companies on the mission had meetings with potential Japanese distributors and sought openings for products ranging from furniture and sporting goods to yachts, processed foods and pet foods. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> says recent trade promotions have succeeded beyond expectations. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> of the embassy's agriculture trade office said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food show this summer drew 6,000 visitors when 3,000 to 4,000 had been expected. Sales made at the show totaled $ 7.5 million and exhibitors projected sales would increase by $ 133 million in the coming year as a result of the show, she said.

 Share prices finished higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market shrugged off the report of a narrowing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in July. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 8.8 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,765.1. Volume was 394.6 million shares, compared with 369.2 million shares traded Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank to $ 9.53 billion in July from a revised $ 13.34 billion gap in June. Many analysts had been looking for a deficit of about $ 11.5 billion for July. Experts said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shares failed to react to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade news because there are still grave concerns facing the British economy, particularly its own trade deficit problem. `` The subdued response to the figures can only be attributed to the fact that institutional sentiment remains unenthusiastic towards the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> market,'' one analyst said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a director at <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WoodMac </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said interest rate concerns continue to weigh on the British market. `` There were some worries in the back of people's minds that with the dollar surging and sterling under pressure, there might be another round of interest rate increases to lift the pound,'' he said. Several market watchers said traders in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> found it disturbing that Wall Street did not sustain an advance on the trade figures. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorrk </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was up only 2.31 points to 2,085.35 by the close of trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 Following the lead of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, several major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines have sharply reduced their air fares to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced a new round-trip restricted fare of $ 298 to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The new fare represents a 41 percent cut from the airline's previous lowest fare of $ 508 for the same route, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said Wednesday. In addition to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` Super Eurosaver,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said it also is offering new `` Eurosaver'' fares to 22 other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities that are up to 30 percent cheaper. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> quickly said they would match the new fares in the markets where they compete with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it was studying the possibility of fare cuts, but had made no decision. The reductions are designed to stimulate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passenger traffic to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which has suffered recently from the dollar's decline against major foreign currencies. In addition, Ms. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said, it is part of a strategy for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> to move away from the use of travel consolidators, who buy large volumes of discounted tickets from airlines, mark them up 10 percent to 20 percent and then resell them to travel agents and consumers. `` It is part of a strategy to move away from the consolidators, offering a competitive product directly to the public and through the retail travel agents,'' she said. The $ 298 Pan Am <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> fare can be used for travel only on certain days of the week, and the first day of travel must be between Oct. 16 and Dec. 7. Travel must be completed by Dec. 15. The non-refundable tickets must be purchased 45 days in advance, except for those bought before Sept. 30. `` Eurosaver'' fares to other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities must be purchased 30 days in advance and within 48 hours of making the reservation. They also are non-refundable. The cities include <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit shrank to $ 9.5 billion in July, the lowest monthly imbalance since December 1984, the government said today in a report that sent stock prices higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the dramatic 28 percent improvement in the trade deficit reflected a small increase in exports and a big decline in imports. The latest trade deficit was certain to cheer Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been trying to deflect charges from Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that the country's soaring trade deficits demonstrate a major flaw in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic program. The July deficit was substantially better than economists had expected. The government did, however, boost the June deficit to $ 13.2 billion from the originally reported $ 12.5 billion. The June deficit was the biggest trade shortfall since a $ 14.4 billion deficit in February, a figure that had sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling by 100 points. The July deficit had the opposite effect. By early afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was up more than 7 points. At one point in the first hour of trading, the average had risen more than 17 points. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed the report, telling an audience in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, that it was `` very good'' news. He added: `` The message is going out to every corner of the world: When <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> goes into the market to compete, we play to win. Others may talk; we deliver.'' Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said in a statement that, `` compared with the same seven months of last year, exports surged 28 percent while imports rose less than 10 percent.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment firm, predicted that the deficit figures would likely remain in the single-digit range in coming months as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers continue to reap the benefits from the decline in the value of the dollar. `` Our exports continue to climb because our goods are cheaper and imports are declining because we have finally found a price high enough to stop consumers from buying imported goods,'' he said. A weaker dollar, in addition to making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products cheaper on overseas markets, makes imports more expensive for American consumers. For the first seven months of this year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit has been running at an annual average of $ 137.5 billion, down 19.3 percent from the record $ 170.3 billion deficit suffered in 1987. The significant narrowing in the trade deficit this year has been a major factor behind the economy's better-than-expected economic performance. Analysts said that more than half of all economic growth this year is coming from the narrowing trade gap. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports are booming as the weaker dollar has made <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods competitive once again on world markets, a factor that has helped push factory operating rates to the highest level in eight years. The $ 9.5 billion July imbalance between exports and imports was only the second single-digit deficit in the last three years and was the lowest since a $ 8.03 billion deficit in December 1984. The deficit had declined to $ 9.76 billion in May. The July improvement reflected a big 8.9 percent drop in imports, which declined to $ 35.99 billion from a record June figure of $ 39.50 billion. Exports were up by a smaller 0.7 percent to $ 26.5 billion, keeping them near the record levels they have been at for the last several months. The big drop in imports came primarily in big-ticket capital goods, which dropped by $ 1.2 billion to $ 8 billion. This category had risen sharply the previous month as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies had looked abroad for the equipment needed to expand their own production facilities. Also dropping sharply in July were car imports, which fell by $ 803 million with almost all of that decline coming from a drop in shipments of cars from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. On the export side, the improvement reflected increases in a variety of products, led by a $ 600 million rise in sales of capital goods. As usual, the country suffered its biggest deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a $ 4.4 billion imbalance, which was unchanged from June. The deficit with Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> rose to $ 2.3 billion from $ 1.9 billion in June. The deficits with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were unchanged at $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion, respectively. With the release of today's report, the government resumed a practice abandoned in 1979 of simultaneously reporting the import figures with the cost of shipping and insurance removed. Using this system, the deficit for July would have been an even lower $ 8.07 billion, down from a June imbalance, minus shipping and insurance, of $ 11.7 billion. The monthly merchandise trade figure for July was the second good report on trade in as many days. The government said Tuesday that the deficit in the current account for the April-June quarter shrank by 9.8 percent to $ 33.3 billion. This report includes not only the trade in merchandise which is reported on a monthly bass but also trade in services, mainly the flow of investment earnings across borders. In a second upbeat report today, the government said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production posted a moderate 0.2 percent increase in August reflecting in part the boom in manufacturing caused by foreign sales.

The dollar inched up in the morning and was trading at about 1.8550 West German marks when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in July was $ 9.5 billion, considerably narrower than the $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion gap that the market had been expecting. The dollar shot up almost two pfennigs and then subsided slightly to about 1.8700 marks before rising again late in the day. Dealers said the dollar's rise was curtailed by fear that the central banks would seek to knock the currency down. Those fears were followed by unconfirmed reports later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had stepped in to sell dollars. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar soared against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6750 to buy one pound, cheaper than late Tuesday's $ 1.6965. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8783 West German marks, up from 1.8470; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up from 1.5600; 6.3915 French francs, up from 6.2935; 2.1155 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0845; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up from 1,380.50; and 1.2223 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2307. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.38 Japanese yen to close at 133.45 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it gained further to 134.55 yen. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 421.75 a troy ounce, compared with $ 420.00 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to $ 421.50 from $ 421.00 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 76 cents to close at a bid of $ 423.45. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.53 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $ 6.46.

 British film producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> said Wednesday he has formed a four-year joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and other international investors to back his next six major feature films. The announcement came about a year after <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, who has produced such films as `` The Killing Fields'' and `` Chariots of Fire,'' resigned as chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> after completing only 15 months of a three-year contract <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, 47, left the studio after <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> merged <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and brought <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> in as president and chief executive of the combined operation. During his brief tenure in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> reportedly clashed with members of the entertainment industry establishment. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>'s own company <ORGANIZATION> Enigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, the partners in the joint venture are <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest mass communications company; <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION>, the venture capital unit of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference, <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> refused to disclose the exact size of each partner's stake, saying only that `` We regard ourselves as equal partners.'' He will produce the films through Enigma, which will have a production fund of $ 50 million in addition to income it makes from its films. The venture intends to make movies aimed at a broad international audience. `` We all share a perspective which tells us that films can and should be made for the international marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Semel </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Asked if he would continue his efforts to cut production costs, which proved unpopular in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> said, `` One thing I've learned is to try and resist ideologies. The producer said he intends to cast `` the best people for the best films as possible.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> said, `` He can make hit films with both unknown and known filmmakers.'' <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> said he expects the venture to release its first film in the autumn of 1990. The venture's movies will be distributed worldwide by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> with two exceptions. Fujisankei will be responsible for video and television distribution in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> has acquired the British satellite television rights. The Fujisankei group includes the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> television network and the <ORGANIZATION> Sankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspapers and publishing companies.

 The stock market moved higher today in a lukewarm response to better-than-expected news on international trade. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points in the early going, showed an 8.35 gain at 2,091.39 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 766 up, 544 down and 568 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's trade deficit shrank to $ 9.53 billion in July from a revised gap of $ 13.22 billion the month before Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a July figure in the $ 11 billion to $ 11.5 billion range. Of particular note, brokers said, was a substantial drop in imports. That was taken as a sign that the momentum of the domestic economy was slowing in response to recent credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. A moderation of economic growth would presumably allow the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to pursue a less restrictive credit policy, encouraging steady to lower interest rates. The dollar rose in foreign exchange following the trade report, and interest rates fell in the credit markets. But stock traders shied away from bidding up stocks aggressively, suggesting that the market was still not over its late-summer malaise.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today confirmed the nomination of investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to serve as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary during the remaining four months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The 92-2 vote installed <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> with time to spare before a meeting late next week in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> of finance ministers from the world's industrial powers. Senators of both parties were anxious for a strong vote of confidence to strengthen <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s hand in the meeting of the G-7, as the finance ministers' group is known. `` If we did not confirm <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, he would go with a little bit of a cloud over his head to an important international meeting. Nothing could serve the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the country more than to give <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> a unanimous vote of approval,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said shortly before the vote. Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D., sounded one of the few discordant notes, voting against the nomination after criticizing <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> for saying during his confirmation hearing that the federal government could grow its way out of the budget deficit. `` Mr. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> says, ` Do n't worry, we'll grow out of it.' Well the truth is different and the truth will out,'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev., also voted against the nomination <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, upon being sworn in, will be the third <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary to serve under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who later became White House chief of staff, held the cabinet post from 1981 to 1985, turning it over to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is expected to do little more than serve as a caretaker this year, he would be the most likely candidate to serve as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary if Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had voted 15-0 on Tuesday to recommend confirmation of the popular former senator. At the committee hearing, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> promised he would reassure the G-7 of his intent to continue the economic cooperation policies of his predecessor. The steady decline of the value of the dollar since September 1985, coordinated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its economic allies, has been credited with reviving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales abroad and reducing the trade deficit this year. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> delivered generally upbeat remarks to the committee on the prospects of narrowing both the trade gap and the federal budget deficit. He even managed to get credit for a stock market rally late in the day. Responding to senators' concerns that the trade deficit still was too large, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> urged them to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies time to respond to the fall in the value of the dollar. `` We have to give the system a chance to work. My prediction is that the trade deficit is going to come down and one of the surprises of the next two or three years is how fast it will come down,'' he said. Analysts cited the comments as the reason for a last-minute surge in the price of stocks, which had been slightly lower for much of the day. Traders apparently interpreted the remarks as hinting that the government's report on the July trade deficit would be favorable. It was. The government reported today that the deficit shrank to $ 9.5 billion, the lowest in nearly four years. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also said growing overseas investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has risen as foreigners purchase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets with the dollars they earn from selling goods here, can be taken as a sign of the economy's strength and of foreigners' faith in it. On the federal budget deficit, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> praised both the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for their efforts, which have whittled the deficit from $ 220 billion in 1986 to an estimated $ 150 billion this year. `` I do think we can grow our way out of this,'' he said, adding at another point, `` I see no reason at this moment why taxes have to be raised.'' Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., urged <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to offer more than `` platitudes'' on the budget <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> declined to recommend specifics, but promised to present <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with new ideas for reducing the deficit by the end of the year. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, gave <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> a warm endorsement, even though <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is a close adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is a friend and former colleague and in my opinion is a man who is well qualified to be treasury secretary,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` It's a big job, a tough job, but you're used to tough jobs.'' In his latest government assignment, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> headed a presidential task force that studied the causes of the October stock market crash. His report called for greater regulation over some aspects of the markets and was met with a cold shoulder by the administration. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said market reforms put in place since the crash have been `` on the right track,'' declining to criticize the administration for not doing everything his commission advised. `` I'm not sure we were 100 percent right. We did our work in 60 days,'' he said. On another matter, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said federal savings and loan regulators have as much as they can spend for now on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescues and he said he saw no reason, for now, for a taxpayer bailout of the industry. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s great-grandfather founded electric utilities that later became part of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and his grandfather started a precursor of <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, now a division of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The family also founded <ORGANIZATION> Purolator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 58, is co-chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an old-line Wall Street investment firm, which he joined in 1954 after receiving a master's degree in business from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> In 1982, he represented <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> for eight months in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by appointment, filling the seat of Democrat <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had resigned following his conviction in the Abscam influence-peddling scandal.

 A federal judge today approved the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers under a joint operating arrangement granted earlier by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON>'s decision approving the partial merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News came a month after the deal was temporarily put on hold by court order to give opponents a chance to mount a legal challenge. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said the stay issued last month blocking the merger will be allowed to expire at 7:15 p.m. EDT Saturday. `` The court finds that the attorney general was not unreasonable in finding that the Free Press _ a newspaper that has incurred and will continue to incur losses that would already have led to its demise were it not owned by a large corporate parent _ is a failing newspaper,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, who represented the plaintiffs, would not comment on the decision and would not say whether he planned an appeal until he has had an opportunity to read the opinion and consult with his clients. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a group of readers and advertisers in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, had contended that the Free Press, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was not a failing newspaper entitled to anti-trust exemptions under the 1980 Newspaper Preservation Act. The group noted that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> approved the joint operating arrangement before he left office even though an administrative law judge and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-trust division had recommended against it. Opponents of the partial merger, represented by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, argued that the Free Press and the News had each cut advertising and circulation rates to drive the other out of business The publishers' willingness to suffer losses for several years was sustained by the knowledge that the two dailies might eventually qualify for a joint operating agreement merging the two publications' commercial operations, the opponents contended. But <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` was not unreasonable in concluding that the Free Press was primarily motivated by competitive aims, not a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, in its recent business strategies.'' The judge dismissed the plaintiff's argument that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s findings were flawed because he accepted the factual findings but not the conclusions of the administrative law judge `` It is not clear that the attorney general disagreed with the -LRB- law judge's -RRB- fact findings as much much as his inferences derived from facts.'' The administrative law judge's finding `` shows that the prospect of a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> played at most a secondary or supporting role in the newspapers' motivations,'' <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> maintained in court last week there was no evidence of collusion between the Free Press and the News, purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, several months before the two papers sought the joint operating agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has threatened to close the morning <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which has lost $ 100 million over the last nine years, unless the partial merger was allowed to go forward. At a hearing last week, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area would lose 2,200 jobs if the Free Press closed, compared to the 600 to 800 layoffs that would result from the consolidation of the two newspapers' business, advertising and circulation departments. Under the proposed joint operating agreement, the papers would maintain separate editorial staffs to put out separate daily editions. Combined editions would be published on weekends. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said the Free Press was powerless to cut losses by raising its prices unless the News first raised its circulation and advertising rates. The News, which has also sustained significant losses, was determined to drive the Free Press out of business if a joint operating agreement was not approved, he said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> had a daily circulation last year of 638,720 daily compared to the News' 678,720. On Sundays, the News held a slightly larger lead _ 839,319 to 724,342.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mostly Higher On Hurricane Fears, Export Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on new export demand and speculation that Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> posed a threat to crops, analysts said. Analysts said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s record-high winds and heavy rain were not likely to cause serious damage to soybean crops in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> since few of those fields are near the Gulf Coast. But storms spawned by the hurricane could play havoc with corn and soybean crops in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where a summer drought has weakened the stalks of many plants, analysts said. Corn also benefitted from Tuesday's news that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 350,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn from private exporters, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Wheat futures were supported by reports that <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had bid for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. `` The wheat market is acting very well and adding exports adds strength to it,'' he said. At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.12 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.85 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 3 cents higher with September at $ 2.68 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 5 cents higher with September at $ 8.81 a bushel.

 The stock market overcame some early hesitancy to reach a five-week high Wednesday, responding to better-than-expected news on international trade.

 Money traders scrambled to buy dollars Wednesday after the government announced the sharpest trade-deficit drop in nearly six years, driving up the currency's value despite <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> intervention. Gold prices declined marginally in late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after rising abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted bullion at $ 429.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 10 cents from the same time Tuesday. Currency-market analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the July trade deficit narrowed to $ 9.5 billion in July, about $ 3 billion below expectations, incited a wild dollar buying spree that overwhelmed central-bank attempts to moderate the rise through small bursts of dollar selling. `` They just plummeted the foreign currencies against the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakubzak </PERSON>, fund director for managed accounts at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based currency futures trading concern. `` There was some Fed selling of dollars, but traders just ignored it.'' The 28 percent June-to-July deficit decrease was the biggest improvement since a 35.7 percent narrowing in September 1982. It gave the country the lowest monthly imbalance since December 1984, when the deficit was $ 8 billion. Traders interpreted the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report as a strong signal that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s appetite for imports is waning, thereby reducing inflation prospects and strengthening the relative worth of the dollar vs. other currencies. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.38 Japanese yen to close at 133.45 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it gained further to 134.55 yen. By the time trading closed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 134.27 yen, vs. 133.37 yen late Tuesday. The dollar soared against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where sterling fetched $ 1.6750, vs. $ 1.6965 late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sterling was quoted at $ 1.6793, cheaper than its $ 1.6941 level late Tuesday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with levels late Tuesday: 1.8770 West German marks, up from 1.8534; 1.5817 Swiss francs, up from 1.5608; 1.2241 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2283; 6.3875 French francs, up from 6.2950; and 1,398.75 Italian lire, up from 1,383.50. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday: 1.8783 West German marks, up from 1.8470; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up from 1.5600; 6.3915 French francs, up from 6.2935; 2.1155 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0845; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up from 1,380.50; and 1.2223 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2307. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 421.75 a troy ounce, compared with $ 420.00 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to $ 421.50 from $ 421.00, and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it rose 76 cents to $ 423.45. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery fell 20 cents to $ 421.30. Silver rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market to $ 6.53 a troy ounce vs. $ 6.46 Tuesday.

<HEAD>Alcoa Announces Profit-Sharing Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said Wednesday that 7,000 salaried employees in its domestic aluminum operations will participate in a profit-sharing plan beginning this year. Officials said the plan would create a profit-sharing pool when the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations exceed a return of 6 percent on assets. They said employees would share 17 percent of profits above this threshold. <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> officials said individual payouts will vary with profits and the number of employees involved. The plan is retroactive to Jan. 1, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> said the payout could amount to about 7 percent of each employee's base salary if second-half 1988 profits equal first-half profits. In contract negotiations three weeks ago, the company offered a profit-sharing plan to union employees that would amount to up to $ 1,300 for blue-collar workers, based on <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>'s expected 1988 profits. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> union </ORGANIZATION> said it rejected the plan as inadequate and said it opposed the company's plan to extend it to salaried, white-collar workers. On Aug. 24, the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers unions broke off early negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> after rejecting offers that included profit-sharing, an immediate ratification bonus, annual lump sum bonuses, an improved medical insurance option and increased pension benefits. <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said the talks ended because <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> `` would not address several key issues,'' including wage and pension increases. The unions sought new contracts to recover concessions negotiated in 1986, when the aluminum industry faced difficult economic times.

<HEAD>Latin Americans Pledge New Initiatives on Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations Wednesday pledged to take the initiative in solving their debt crisis as they began an annual round of talks on regional economic problems. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 26-member Latin American Economic System -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SELA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, called for a new approach on the region's $ 410 billion debt which `` does not mean decreeing a moratorium or creating a debtors' club.'' He said it could mean reaching agreement on a common negotiating framework which would include linking debt payments to export income, limiting interest rates and paying according to the market value of the debts. `` SELA must take a serious initiative regarding the foreign debt,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> told delegates at the opening of the technical meeting of <ORGANIZATION> SELA </ORGANIZATION>'s 14th Annual Council. The three-day ministerial level meeting begins Sept. 19. `` We are convinced that the solutions to the region's problems will not come from abroad. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must make a united effort to generate its own initiatives,'' he said. He also recommended that <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> use its annual $ 65 billion in imports from industrialized nations as a negotiating tool to `` equalize'' trade in the face of growing protectionism. `` Everything the region exports is negotiated, but what we import is not negotiated. This form of commercial relations must change,'' he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s call for greater regional action comes as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which begin their annual assembly Sept. 27 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, admit that their market-oriented approach to solving the Latin American debt problem has not had the desired results. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> lends to debtors which agree to adopt austerity policies to promote economic stability. But Latin American debtors claim that the policies limit their ability to grow out of their debts. In its 1987 annual report, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> notes that the debt burden was a key factor in causing Latin American economies to shrink by 1.5 percent overall last year. `` There remains much to be done to relieve the weight of the debt and restore world growth,'' <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said in the report's introduction.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advertising company <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a Soviet government agency said Wednesday they had agreed on a joint project to help Soviet and Western companies reach each other's markets. The joint venture is expected to begin work here next January with a staff of six, including two Americans.

The Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet organization also will provide similar services to Western firms trying to crack the Soviet market. `` If earlier it was enough for them to have several reliable contacts in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to strike a deal, now they have to choose among hundreds of Soviet enterprises and foreign trade firms,'' <PERSON> Deomidov </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> said the new venture will be owned and managed jointly with a board of directors having equal representation from each partner.

<HEAD>Largest Shareholder Seeks Control, Sale Of Zenith</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, frustrated by the company's steep losses in recent years, announced plans Wednesday to seize control of the company and sell it. <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor group with a 6.1 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, said it planned to wage a proxy fight to reduce the size of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors from 10 seats to six and to replace three of the six directors with its own nominees. `` Our decision is based on the firm conviction that direction is needed to ensure the board's compliance with the collective will of the company's shareholders,'' the dissident group said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s board. Spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> officials had not seen a copy of the lawsuit, `` so it is inappropriate to comment.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the last remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television manufacturer, has been fighting a losing battle against low-priced imported televisions. Despite the success of its highly regarded computers, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> suffered multimillion-dollar losses for the past three years, including a loss of $ 19.1 million last year on sales of $ 2.36 billion. The company's stock gained 12 -LCB- cents Wednesday in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, closing at $ 21.75. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON>, general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that the group would seek written consents from shareholders to undertake its plan. He said <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON> had filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> challenging a provision in <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s articles of incorporation that requires the unanimous consent of all stockholders for an action initiated by written consent to be effective. Brookhurst claims the provision violates <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> laws guaranteeing the right of stockholders to take action by written consent, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit of $ 400,000, or 1 cent a share, on sales of $ 574.1 million in the first quarter of 1988, but had a second quarter loss of $ 12.1 million. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> has said repeatedly since April that the board was exploring `` all options'' for returning the company to profitability, including selling its television-making consumer electronics unit. But Brookhurst, formed by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihasz </PERSON> specifically to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> stock, said it no longer could tolerate the board's apparent inaction or its strategy of cutting costs while waiting for television prices to stablilize. `` In our view, this can lead only to increased debt, lower earnings, inadequate cash flow and more serious financial difficulties,'' the partnership said in its letter. `` Other major shareowners have expressed to us their agreement with our views and frustration with the board of directors' continuing failure to enhance share value. <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ihasz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> would be the three Brookhurst nominees to <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s board, <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON> said. The partnership proposes to retain directors <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaicks </PERSON>, none of whom work for <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, and to dump <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurthrie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON> said.

 Businessman <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> has been elected to the board of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, where he joins his brother, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, the communications giant announced Wednesday. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, better known as <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>, stepped down in March after serving 19 months as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Postmaster General. It had been speculated widely that he eventually would join the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> board. The <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> brothers already have considerable economic ties. They serve as co-chief executives of <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a tobacco, real estate, insurance and hotel conglomerate that is CBS's biggest shareholder. In addition, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> is president and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>'s election to the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> board at a regular board meeting was announced by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> founder and chairman. In a statement, <PERSON> Paley </PERSON> was quoted as saying the new board member has `` broad experience in business and public affairs and he should be a most valuable addition to the company.'' His election boosts membership on the board to 14 from 13. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> board has operated with 13 members since September 1986 when <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> was ousted as chairman and chief executive following a dramatic boardroom battle. At that time, the board made <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> acting chief executive and <PERSON> Paley </PERSON> became acting chairman. Four months later, the board deleted the word `` acting'' from their job titles. Under <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has trimmed costs, sold its magazine and records divisions and seen its television network fall to third place last season for the first time in the prime time ratings. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> has installed new executives at the head of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting and news operations and has vowed to put the network back on top in the ratings.

<HEAD>Struggling Movie Company Gets $80 Million Loan from GECC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will get 15 percent of the stock in struggling <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in return for an $ 80 million loan aimed at helping the movie and television company service its heavy long-term debt, the companies announced Wednesday. The loan, which <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> intends to repay with proceeds from the planned sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Marvel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, allowed the company to redeem $ 141.5 million in long-term debt. The new $ 80 million loan brings to $ 115 million the credit from <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> to New World. `` The debt restructuring is a cornerstone of the turnaround for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, co-chairman. The latest debt transaction, combined with two similar moves earlier this year, reduced <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term debt from $ 285 million to $ 55 million. Interest costs, which had been crippling <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, will be cut from more than $ 33 million a year to about $ 6 million a year, <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said. Marvel, which makes comic books such as `` Spiderman'' and `` The Incredible Hulk'' and cartoons, has attracted numerous bidders, but a sale agreement has not been reached, <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said. New World lost $ 7.9 million in the first quarter of this year, but is banking on the debt swap and potential earnings from new TV shows and movies, including `` Crime Story'' and `` The Wonder Years,'' a new show which won an Emmy Award. The company's most recent movies, `` 18 Again,'' `` Dead Heat'' and `` Wrong Guys,'' did not do well at the box office.
