<HEAD>Savings and Loans Had Record Withdrawals in December</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Savings and loan customers withdrew a record $ 8.1 billion from their accounts in December, evidence, economists say, that the industry is being squeezed by higher interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates 2,955 federally insured savings and loans, said Friday that December marked the eighth consecutive month of net withdrawals, reversing the tide of deposits that poured into S & amp; Ls following the 1987 stock market crash. Meanwhile, in other developments: _ <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, in an interview, confirmed published reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> put together a contingency plan last weekend in the event that the announcement of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for the savings and loan crisis triggered depositor _ The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> said it has taken control of six more savings institutions, bringing to 10 the number of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls brought under the agency's jurisdiction since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave it that responsibility on Monday The December withdrawals, topping the one-month record of $ 7.0 billion set in November, occurred at a time of mounting publicity about S & amp; L problems. Regulators closed or merged 75 institutions that month. But <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, attributed the development to interest rate movements rather than to nervousness by S & amp; L customers. He said customers are turning to money market mutual funds and other investments because S & amp; Ls are resisting pushing up interest rates as fast. However, he predicted S & amp; L deposit rates likely would be forced higher as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> tightens credit in an effort to dampen inflation. `` Boy, that's hard on the bottom line,'' he said. `` This does not bode well for thrift earnings.'' Indeed, one member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, dissented from a policy-making board's decision in December to push interest rates higher on the grounds that could aggravate S & amp; Ls' problems Her opposition to higher rates was revealed in minutes released Friday of the Dec. 13-14 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. However, economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> said the president's effort this week appears to have bolstered confidence in savings institutions. `` If you look at the stock market, they look at this whole process as being a net plus,'' he said. `` Thrift stocks have risen in the last few days because I guess they feel the problem is being addressed.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the bank board, attributed a large share of the December deposit flow to a single, healthy institution which shrank its deposit base by $ 3.4 billion as part of a deliberate strategy of substituting lower cost borrowing. He also noted that money normally flows out of savings accounts in December as people spend to celebrate the holidays. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, in an interview Friday, said administration officials who he declined to name were predicting depositor runs when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his S & amp; L plan and that the president insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> have an emergency plan in place. `` I was on the other side -LRB- of the argument -RRB- but I was just as eager as anybody to have a plan in place in case I happened to be wrong,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which insures bank deposits, will take control of more than 200 insolvent S & amp; Ls in the next four to six weeks under a cooperation agreement with the agency insuring thrift deposits, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The six institutions taken over Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> are: First Federal of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, both of Little Rock, Ark.; <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; Bright Banc, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Deseret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Hoping he has put questions about his private bank holdings behind him, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> set out today on a week-long trip to the capitals of the 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> likely to be dominated by defense and trade issues. For <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, whose foreign policy experience is slight, the trip beginning in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and winding up next Friday in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is a learning experience and a warmup for a probable <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in the spring. `` It is a listening trip and it is a consulting trip,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Friday at a news conference here. `` But I am carrying a message. We want to make it clear the way to approach the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relationship is with prudence and with realism. We want you to know we are not dragging our feet, seeking delay for the sake of delay.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he would solicit the views of the allied governments on how to negotiate strategic nuclear weapons reductions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and what to do about modernizing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s battlefield weapons. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> hopes, meanwhile, he has put to rest a potentially ticklish problem over his holdings in <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by saying he would `` tend to be guided'' by whatever conclusions are reached by government ethics lawyers. The holding company has $ 4.5 billion in loans to Third World nations, and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as secretary of state will be called on to play a leading role in addressing the economic problems of developing countries. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he would ask for a presidential waiver allowing him to participate in such decisions. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he would also consider other options, such as selling his stock or changing the terms of the blind trust in which all his holdings have been placed in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. `` I have concluded I should seek a waiver because that gives me additional protection and helps avoid any appearance of impropriety,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, where he stopped with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for five hours of talks with Canadian leaders. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top adviser on ethics, and other government lawyers were trying to find `` a mechanism or actions that would be taken in my case to insulate me from charges or appearances of a conflict of interest.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had not talked to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, and that the President's ethics adviser had not asked him to sell the bank stock But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had raised selling as an option in talking to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmit </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who was named Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. `` I have been very careful about recusing myself from specific issues that might constitute a conflict of an appearance of conflict,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, referring to his jobs as White House chief of staff and then <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. However, he said government attorneys also told him he could participate in `` general policy determinations'' without violating ethical standards. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are in the midst of a review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. Negotiations with the Soviets to reduce long-range missiles are on hold, and the administration also faces a decision on whether to ease restrictions on technology sales to the Soviets. At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will try on the trip to promote increased defense spending by the allies even while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration tries to keep its own outlays in check. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who began his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> discussions Friday night with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, is also under pressure from the allies to ease restrictions on trade with the Soviets. Automatic curbs on technology that could have a military use were imposed by the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration to punish the Soviets for the 1979 invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviet troops are leaving, with the last soldier due out by next Wednesday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had not made up his mind, despite reports that he had decided to lift the automatic curbs. But he stressed that if the curbs are eased `` this does not mean we are opening the doors to technology transfers.''

<TEXT>
 With two years remaining in World War II, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON> composed his harrowing Eighth Symphony, a reflection on the destruction of war. Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Solti </PERSON> brought all the flash he is know for to the hour-long piece Friday night as he led the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> surely has never met a cresecendo he did n't like, which suits this Shostakovich perfectly. As the strings and the woodwinds fade in the desolation of the score's final pages, the previous thunder of brass and percussion has left the audience yearning for peacefulness. `` In this work, there was an attempt to express the emotional experience of the people,'' <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON> wrote, `` to reflect the terrible tragedy of war.'' To convey that experience, <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON> uses all the orchestral artillery he can muster. After 15 minutes of buildup, begun darkly by the cellos and basses, the percussion lets loose like a marching band, sounding the drumbeat of the war that surrounded <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>. And what orchestra better to capture that sound than the Chicagoans? More than any other orchestra, it has managed to maintain a distinctive sound in the age of plane-hopping music directors. It's tone is bold and brash, powered by perhaps the best brass section in the world. Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON>, celebrating his 20th season as music director and his 75th birthday, still leaps about the podium with the energy of a teenager, whipping his troops to let loose. Even when the score briefly turns towards peasant dance music at the beginning of the fifth and final movement, Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> reaches for the big sound. Earlier, with a much-reduced orchestra, Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> led a warm rendition of <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>'s Fifth Symphony. <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> wrote it during a month-long stretch in 1816, when he was 19, and although it does not come close to the quality of his Eighth and <ORGANIZATION> Ninth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphonies </ORGANIZATION>, it has an almost Mozartian softness. The Chicagoans had a chance to show off their violins, especially during the three allegros. Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON>, in contrast to his `` Falstaff'' four years ago, let the sis-boom-bah rest in a piece that did n't need it.

 A blocked heater pipe spread deadly fumes through a house, killing four young men and leaving a woman in critical condition, authorities said Friday. The deadly fumes `` might be either gas or carbon monoxide, but we're leaning toward carbon monoxide,'' <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Greca </PERSON> said. `` It appears that they have been dead for some time, in terms of hours or days, I do n't know,'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Greca </PERSON> said. `` Somehow, the woman was able to survive.'' A flue pipe inside the living room heater and a separate pipe connecting the heater to an outside wall were blocked, causing the fumes to seep into the room, said <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>. The four men were pronounced dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said supervisor <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopecky </PERSON>. She identified two of the victims as brothers <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazek </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazek </PERSON>, 21. Another victim, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Prykop </PERSON>, 18, who was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, did not live at the house but were neighbors. The fourth victim, a 36-year-old man, was not immediately identified. Four people were found in the living room and one person in a bedroom, authorities said. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, extremely poisonous gas. Because it has no odor or color, persons breathing it usually fall asleep without realizing they are being poisoned. It results when fuels containing carbon like coal or oil burn in stoves or furnaces that contain insufficient oxygen. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Greca </PERSON> said authorities determined there was no need to evacuate nearby buildings after gas company workers shut off the supply of gas to the building.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> scorched some kitchen tiles and told his wife they fell off the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle. That, police say, was just one prop in <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s pose as an astronaut during a period of make-believe that carried him through several states, speaking engagements and marriages. Now his wife is leaving him and he faces fraud and larceny charges for taking his make-believe too far. State police arrested Hunt on Jan. 28 in suburban <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>. The 27-year-old plumber's son from <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> is accused of swindling his fourth wife and bride of five months, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, of up to $ 50,000 on her company-issued credit card without her knowledge and for taking $ 4,000 from a <LOCATION> Saugus </LOCATION> family on the promise he could get their 18-year-old son out of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. On Jan. 6, calling himself Marine Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Hunt, the fake astronaut spoke before a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a very good speaker, he entertained us. He held us spellbound for 2 -LCB- hours,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> chapter president, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, 23, a former optical engineer, also believed he was an astronaut. `` I love the person I thought I was married to,'' she said. Recalling the day he was unmasked, <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said, `` I was shocked. It was almost like watching someone die. He just dissolved, disappeared.'' Hunt is being held on $ 100,000 bail in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> jail. His case in <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was continued to Feb. 15 after a request for reduced bail was denied. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipoletta </PERSON>, could not be reached Friday, but he has said he urged his client not to speak to the news media. Investigators compiling the story of <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s alleged stories say that for the past eight years he has been fooling many people in imaginative ways _ in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Montour </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lighow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> allegedly rode around <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in a limousine seeking models for his baby powder while pretending to be a powder maker. He said Friday that he was investigating charges that <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> swindled his third wife, a local woman, out of large amounts of money. He would not elaborate. Authorities say <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> is believed to have been married to two other women. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doan </PERSON>, the owner of an air service in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was convinced by <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> that he was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter pilot. Last summer, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> chartered a jet to fly with his wife to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, allegedly charging it on his wife's credit card while telling her the flight cost nothing because he was a space shuttle pilot. In <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Oct. 8, he was granted a 10-minute interview with <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>, lord mayor of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>'s spokeswoman said the meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Mansion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the official residence, was arranged after <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON> was told <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was a visiting astronaut. The spokewoman said when <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told the lord mayor that <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was arranging for him to be married at <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON> realized <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was `` not the full shilling,'' but politely said nothing. Others were completely taken in. During Hunt's arrest, police searched the apartment and found assorted military paraphernalia, flight jumpsuits and a helmet bearing the insignia of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, a forensic psychiatrist who is an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> consultant and a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, said there are cases in legal circles falling under the category of the so-called imposter phenomenon. `` It's generally believed that people who are able to dupe others into believing that they have some professional status that's untrue, most likely suffer from antisocial personality disorder,'' said <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, who is on sabbatical in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> He said a recent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> survey found about 5 percent of adult urba men and nearly 1 percent of adult urban women suffer from the disorder. <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> said the ailment can be hereditary and that `` people who -LRB- practice -RRB- such deceptions tend not to have the same depth of emotions, of empathy and warmth, despite their charm.'' Why are so many duped? `` It takes energy, thought, mental work to be skeptical about the myriad claims to legitimacy we come upon every day,'' he said. `` It's easier to take people at their word, particularly when it conveys some status by associating with them.''

<HEAD>Experts Disagree on Whether Tax Plan Would Help Oil Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed tax breaks for oil drillers are winning an expected round of applause from the oil industry, but officials and analysts disagree over whether the measures will stem the decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production. `` I do n't think we're going to get that much more oil out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> even if these tax incentives were passed,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizen-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group that favors greater use of renewable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels. `` It's more of a political gesture to the industry'' than a plan for revitalizing domestic oil production, <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> said in an interview Friday. Industry officials said the proposed tax incentives, worth at least $ 350 million a year, would, if enacted, result in a measurable gain in oil and gas production. `` This is a very healthy step forward,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Groninger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> director of governmental affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` Tax incentives are an important component of a national energy policy.'' The tax breaks unveiled by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his budget address Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were coupled with a postponement of lease sales for oil drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coasts _ areas the oil companies consider prime drilling prospects. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was seeking to balance environmental needs with a desire to revitalize the depressed oil and gas industry, which he called vital to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, representing the nation's major oil companies, welcomed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tax incentives but said more steps would be needed, including opening up more federal lands and offshore areas to oil exploration. `` The tax incentives ... are a step in the right direction, but they alone can not stem the serious decline in domestic petroleum production,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON>, president of the petroleum institute. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production has fallen by more than 1 million barrels a day over the past three years, and last December the oil production rate was the lowest in nearly a quarter of a century. At the same time, oil demand has increased in recent years, leading to a reliance on imports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says poses security risks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected the idea of imposing a tariff on imported oil but proposed four tax incentives aimed at boosting exploratory drilling, particularly by smaller operators. The tax breaks would be phased out if the price of oil, currently about $ 17 a barrel, rose above $ 21. The tax package includes: _ A 10 percent credit on the first $ 10 million of spending, per company per year, on intangible drilling costs, those not directly associated with drilling a well, such as hauling equipment _ A 10 percent credit for spending on all new tertiary enhanced recovery projects, those that use steam, carbon dioxide or chemical injectants to increase the production rate from oil and natural gas fields _ Allow drillers to exclude a major part of their income from the alternative minimum tax _ Change oil and natural gas depletion rules that the administration says discourage the transfer of marginal wells from major oil companies to independent producers and result in the premature abandonment of producing wells The administration said the tax package was aimed mainly at the smaller producers, which traditionally have drilled the majority of new wells in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Students trying to raise money usually go in for bake sales or car washes, but kids at a high school here have come up with a service that's a hit with their classmates _ computer dating. With Valentine's Day approaching, students have been lining up in the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at lunch hour, ready to pay $ 1 for the names of three potential dates whose answers to 20 questions most closely match theirs. `` The first two days we've had people piling around the table, throwing money at us,'' student <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said recently. Computer student <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said he spent two or three months writing the software for the dating service, then distributed questionnaires. `` We're not up to Dating Game standards, yet,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. `` We have n't said it is the perfect date or anything like that.'' So far, the students have raised about $ 200, which will go toward computer lab equipment. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> have bigger ideas for their computer program. They hope to copyright it and market it to other schools.

 The aroma of old leather mingled with the smell of new money at the nation's largest book fair, where you could pick up a 1632 edition of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> or `` The Philosophy of <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'' bound with $ 5 bills. `` I love to lose myself in other men's minds,'' wrote <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> in an essay on books and reading, and he would have been blissfully transported at the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> International Antiquarian Book Fair, which opened Friday. Organizers hoped a record 8,000 people would browse through the centuries of writers' and bookbinders' art, not to mention buy. But the 188 booksellers from throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and seven other countries anticipated winning new devotees as well as making profits. `` Book fairs cultivate book collectors. They come here and see things they've never seen before,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, a bookseller and chairman of this year's fair. `` They love literature or see the beauty of the illustrations. ... They get into it, and pretty soon, they're hooked,'' said <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, whose necktie was printed with rows of books. `` In most cases, it's a consuming disease _ a consuming passion, that's better.'' Future collectors might catch the bug while admiring a second folio edition of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s plays, offered for $ 60,000, a painstakingly illuminated 15th century Flemmish manuscript Book of Hours for $ 35,000 or a 1482 Venetian volume of Euclid priced at $ 25,000. The most expensive item is a three-volume set of the first edition of Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, published in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1851 and entitled The Whale. It's price? A quick $ 75,000. But it's in first-class condition and a gold-embossed whale adorns the spine of each volume. Collectors on a tighter budget could choose an autographed copy of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>'s `` An Ideal Husband'' bound in gold-stamped blue morocco leather and costing $ 4,950. Even some 20th century authors command a handsome price. A first edition of <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s `` Casino Royale,'' for example, is offered for $ 1,250. Despite fears that television and videos have produced a nation of people who do n't read, dealers said growing numbers of people are becoming fascinated by _ and buying _ rare books. `` Business is better that it's ever been,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Some collectors think of their purchases as investments that will increase in value with the years. But even collectors with an eye toward possible resale buy the old and rare volumnes primarily out of love. `` The preponderance of them are buying not for investment but for just having it as something beautiful, just like having a Picasso,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. Having something rare and beautiful does n't have to cost thousands of dollars. Prices at the fair start at about $ 20, and some first editions of well-known authors such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> and <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> can be had for about $ 100. `` If you fall in love with an illustrator or an author ... from <PERSON> Elior </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> ... you'll search for the things you can afford,'' said <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, who gave up newspaper work to become a book dealer in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Cruz 18 years ago. A part of the admission proceeds from the fair, which continues through Sunday, goes to the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Environmental Impact Minimal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> study concludes that deploying huge MX nuclear missiles on railroad cars would neither interfere with the operation of the nation's rail network nor harm the environment significantly. The final Environmental Impact Statement, released Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, turned up some problems at a few of the 11 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases that are being considered as candidates for `` rail garrisons.'' But the statement insists that `` while there is a very slight potential for accidents with the deployment of the -LRB- MX -RRB- Rail Garrison System, the system would be safe and would pose negligible risk to human health and the environment.'' Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the development of a rail-basing plan for the 10-warhead MX _ a weapon he dubbed the Peacekeeper _ in December 1986. His goal was to overcome congressional concerns about the vulnerability of the missiles inside underground silos. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is now facing a March 15 congressional deadline to decide if he'll back <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan. If he does, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agrees, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to build 25 six-car trains with each carrying two MX missiles. Each garrison could house up to four trains. Because of the small number of trains involved, the conclusion Friday that the system would not interfere with commercial operations had been expected. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also went out of its way to note that training operations for crews would be conducted with fake trains that would n't carry real MX missiles. In the event of a derailment or other accident, the chances of an explosion or fire involving the missile's propellants are `` unlikely'' and for the nuclear warheads, virtually impossible, the report says. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons include safety features and control over arming mechanisms that assure there is virtually no possibility of an inadvertent nuclear detonation,'' the report states. The rail car launchers would remain inside fortified military bases unless there was a threat of war, and only then would scramble on the commercial rail network to avoid a Soviet first-strike attack, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The heaviest environmental impact would stem from construction activities at any bases selected to serve as garrisons for the MX cars, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. Those would consist primarily of increased traffic congestion, the short-term degradation of air quality and in a few instances, the relocation of inhabited buildings. Of the 11 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases reviewed, however, four would likely suffer `` significant degradation of biological resources'' if rail garrisons were built, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reported. Those four are <ORGANIZATION> Barksdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, La.; Fairchild Air Force Base, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whiteman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; and <ORGANIZATION> Wurtsmith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. Despite those findings, the impact statement offers no ranking of the 11 bases, nor does it disqualify any base from consideration. It repeats a decision made two years ago that F.E. <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, will be the headquarters and first home for any MX trains. But it noted that rail deployment has not been approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and that it is premature to select other bases. The other bases considered candidates are <ORGANIZATION> Eaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Little Rock Air Force Base in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Minot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Malstrom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Mont.

<HEAD>Study Says Trade-Zone Program Hurts US Parts Makers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional study concludes that a foreign-trade zone program intended to encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports instead is helping foreign auto parts manufacturers by giving millions of dollars in tariff breaks. `` Although originally created in order to encourage export-oriented trade, in its current form the program provides greater benefits to firms who import more parts,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a report issued Friday. The report was immediately praised by the <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accessories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s findings `` underscore our industry's conviction that the ... program is broken and needs fixing,'' said the trade association's president, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, from its <LOCATION> Lanham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, headquarters. The report recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amend the 1934 foreign-trade zone law to provide guidance on what public benefits are needed to justify such zones or subzones. Factors to be considered would be exports, imports, employment and investment. Foreign trade zones were originally created to encourage the export of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods that contain foreign parts. The program, however, has `` become a major base'' for manufacturers serving domestic markets, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, requested in 1987 by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>. and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the foreign-trade zones and their subzones in 1986 reduced tariffs on auto parts by $ 38 million The value of parts flowing through the subzones has risen explosively, from $ 200 million in 1978 to $ 5 billion in 1986, the report said. Rep. <PERSON> Sander </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the discrepancy between tariffs on parts and on finished vehicles created an obvious `` private benefit'' for automakers under the program Imported auto parts are subject to tariffs ranging from 4 percent to 11 percent. Finished vehicles are assessed at a 2.5 percent tariff rate. When vehicles built in foreign-trade zones are sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the imported parts are taxed at the lower 2.5 percent rate, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. Automakers using the foreign-trade zone program run the spectrum from the Michigan-based domestic giants _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ to foreign makers like <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> that have established assembly plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most auto assembly plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> come under the program, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the program, uses public benefit as its criterion for judging requests, that standard has not been officially adopted and applications have seldom been denied, the report said. The report recommended the public benefit standard be made part of the law.

<HEAD>Walesa Tries To Keep Solidarity In Check</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> BIELSKO-BIALA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is a man gingerly dividing his time between two types of working clothes these days: a blue suit for his talks with the government and a jacket and jeans for his union supporters. He has been meeting with both this week, a delicate balancing act aimed at winning concessions from the government and while keeping the support of the increasingly fractious Solidarity independent labor movement. Since the Monday opening of the talks, known as the round table, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has met with thousands of Solidarity supporters in three cities to explain why he agreed to negotiate with the same government that banned their union. The Nobel Peace Prize winner visited <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> on Thursday and this industrial town on Friday. Not since the heady days of Solidarity's legal existence in 1980-81 has <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> been able to so freely travel the country and openly meet with the union rank-and-file. More than 400 workers cheered when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> strode into a hall in <LOCATION> Bielsko-Biala </LOCATION>, an industrial center, for the first open meeting of the banned union here in seven years. But they voiced worry about the outcome of the talks first proposed by the government during a wave of strikes in August, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest since the martial law crackdown of December 1981. `` People have doubts. ... They do n't know what these talks are going to bring,'' said <PERSON> Miroslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Styczen </PERSON>, a veteran solidarity activist in <LOCATION> Bielsko-Biala </LOCATION>. `` Most people are really happy about the talks. But there's not complete unity,'' he said. A textile town in the <LOCATION> Beskidy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bielsko-Biala </LOCATION> was one of the strongest Solidarity regions during the union's 16-month legal existence. The Solidarity leader launched into a speech he has consistently delivered all week. He told the workers he did n't really trust the government, but that `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> badly needs agreement.'' His listeners fired back questions. `` How will you get people to join the new unions?'' asked one young worker. `` Today everybody who wants to will soon be able to organize a group,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> replied. `` How is Solidarity going to be organized?'' asked another worker. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had no concrete answer, but he assured them that authorities have made a political decision and that the union would exist again soon. He pleaded for time and urged workers to be patient and not to strike. `` We all have a moral right and arguments to strike. ... Give me a chance at the round table,'' he said. `` If it is too little, we will fight,'' he said. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> did don his dark blue suit for talks with Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> and a later meeting with faculty and students at the 14th century <ORGANIZATION> Jagiellonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> asked the students and professors to excuse him for any grammatical errors he might make, saying he was just a worker. About 2,000 students crowded the halls near loudspeakers outside the small, ornate room where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> addressed about 200 invited guests. One visitor was not allowed in _ a reporter from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>. `` Believe in yourselves and build structures that can bring <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the world,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the audience. Students were dismayed that they had been given only 25 seats in the room, and some seemed skeptical about the round table. `` People are still trying to learn what the round table is about. It's too early to tell,'' said <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertig </PERSON>, a spokesman of the illegal independent students' association. `` <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s speech lacked concrete propositions. People are n't sure how to organize or what to do,'' said another student `` As soon as there will be agreement, we will be able to work,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He did not say how long he expected it would take. The trip was grueling, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> says he must make contact with people to grasp the situation, to reacquaint himself with movement veterans and to meet the new generation of activists. He plans another trip across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next week. Traveling by car, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared tired and impatient when he arrived in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> late Thursday. More than 3,000 people jammed the <ORGANIZATION> Mistrzejowice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> near the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel mill to hear <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> speak. `` Lech, welcome, Solidarity is not underground and was not destroyed,'' said <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurczak </PERSON> of the Solidarity region <LOCATION> Malopolska </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Nobel laureate <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON> and dozens of other world Jewish leaders are coming to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help open the first cultural center for Soviet Jews in more than 50 years. While one of the leaders hailed Sunday's opening of the center as a sign of the improving fortunes of the country's 1.8 million Jews under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said it's too soon to declare an end to the problems of Jews in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Glasnost has taken hold here. The question will be, can it continue?'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, World Jewish Congress President <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON> _ a survivor of the Holocaust and 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner _ are to speak at Sunday's opening of the Solomon Mikhoels Cultural Center. About 70 Jewish leaders from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries plan to attend. The opening comes a few days after a Soviet newspaper made a major admission: that Soviet Jews have suffered discrimination for decades and that dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> destroyed Jewish culture in the country. <PERSON> Mikhoels </PERSON>, a Jewish actor for whom the center was named, was among the thousands of Jews who fell victim to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s terror. He was killed in 1948 in what was officially termed a traffic accident but what many Jews believe was an assassination ordered by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The center is located in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Jewish Musical Theater on <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the southeastern section of the capital. Its director, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluz </PERSON>, told the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that Yiddish and Hebrew classes are planned, itself a major change. The teaching of Hebrew was once punished as a crime, and several Jewish activists were jailed for religious instruction. Soviet laws bar the private teaching of religious subjects to anyone under 18, but authorities have indicated a new law on religion being drafted will ease those and other restrictions. <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> said in an interview that Soviet promises to allow the teaching of Hebrew as well as membership by Soviet Jews in international Jewish organizations `` have been couched in very diplomatic terms.'' `` We have no commitment yet,'' he said. In a report previewing Sunday's opening, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The perestroika, or restructuring drive, has altered the life of Soviet society and prompted the development of Jewish cultural associations.'' But <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> said plans for the center to have a public library, Jewish museum and art gallery could be ruined if Soviet authorities interfere. `` It is not the time to be euphoric, but to make sure the center will be free to develop cultural and educational programs. If that is what the center becomes, it will be a great and epic event,'' <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> said. If authorities step in, he said, `` we will be back where we started from.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has donated to the center an exhibit and Russian-language books about the Nazi campaign against the Jews, and has shown in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a film that accuses the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of kidnapping <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, a Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews during World War II and later disappeared. As part of his effort to improve relations with the West, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has taken several steps to address complaints that his country violates human rights. For Jews, the changes have meant a rise in emigration _ 1988 marked an eight-year high with about 20,000 leaving _ less harassment at Jewish holiday celebrations, and the opening of a private Jewish museum and library in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Chlenov </PERSON>, a member of a private group called the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the government has a long way to go. `` Jewish life in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> is in a state of crisis,'' he wrote in a brochure on the Mikhoels center. `` Official Jewish cultural institutions ... such as magazines, newspapers and theaters do not satisfy the demands of our time. The growing Jewish consciousness refuses to be compressed into an outlived framework.''

<TEXT>
 The Democratic chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees meet with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget officials next week to try to find out what they say President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1990 budget neglected to reveal: how the deficit will be trimmed. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., and his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said Friday they would not proceed with the high-level budget negotiations the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants until they get those details on deficit `` Before we go any further, we want to sit down and find out specifically where they're going, program by program,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said. The lawmakers said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 1.16 trillion spending plan was vague when it came to specifying savings, a strategy aimed at putting the pressure _ and the blame _ on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for cuts that will inevitably be unpopular. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose to give us only the good news,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said of the president's budget address Thursday night to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has left it for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the bad news.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his proposal would leave a deficit of $ 91.1 billion next year, well within the $ 100 billion target required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. He achieves that level by holding the growth in the defense budget to the rate of inflation, providing $ 309 billion in new spending; making a controversial cut in the capital gains tax rate that he says will raise $ 4.8 billion in new revenues; slowing the growth of Medicare by $ 5 billion; selling $ 3.7 billion in federal assets; and extending taxes on telephone service and airline tickets that are due to expire. But of most concern to Democrats is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to limit a collection of more than 1,000 programs _ most of them domestic _ to the $ 136 billion spent for them this year. Democrats said this meant that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was leaving the onus for finding $ 11 billion in cuts up to them, reductions that could affect programs like toxic waste cleanups, mass transit assistance, and law enforcement. `` This is not what we would call a flexible freeze,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promise to reduce the deficit by limiting spending increases to the rate of inflation. `` It's a flexible squeeze.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategy of lumping those programs together. `` There's more room for negotiation this way,'' he said. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> briefed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators and representatives on the budget early Friday, and told reporters afterward that it is time for the administration and congressional leaders to begin negotiating on a spending plan. `` The spirit is very good at the moment and we've got to build on that spirit,'' he said.

 A military aircraft crashed Friday night despite efforts of a crew member to land the plane when the cockpit caught fire and the pilot lost consciousness. One crew member was killed, officials said. The weapons specialist aboard the <ORGANIZATION> F-4 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane tried to land the craft but bailed out before it crashed on a runway at the city airport, said supervisor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Baer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s control tower Lt. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rzepka </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said one crew member was killed and the other was hospitalized. She did not know his condition. It was not immediately known which of the two on board died. Earlier, patrolman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said the pilot was in very critical condition, according to medics at the scene. He did not believe the weapons specialist had suffered serious injuries. Both men were taken to <LOCATION> Lutheran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, but a nursing supervisor there said no information would be released pending notification of relatives. Police learned about the pilotless plane, when the craft was six minutes away from <LOCATION> Baer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. The weapons specialist piloted the plane to the runway, but ejected before it landed. There was no fire at the scene of the crash and the fire in the cockpit had been extinguished, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. Capt. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, squadron flight surgeon for the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> accident board would be appointed to investigate the crash.

<TEXT>
 Supporters of laws to force broadcasters to present both sides of controversial issues say they're heartened by the refusal of a federal appeals court to consider the constitutionality of such a statute. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> ruled Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> properly used its authority in August 1987 when it repealed the so-called Fairness Doctrine. The commission had said the doctrine, written in 1949, no longer served the public interest as defined by the 1934 Communications Act and was unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds. The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> was `` exercising both its congressionally delegated power and its expertise'' when it said the law did not serve the public interest. But the court sidestepped the constitutionality question, which had been a primary issue in the court challenge. The doctrine's constitutionality is likely to be tested if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> writes the doctrine into law again this year as expected `` The big victory here is that any law that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes ... will not be presumptively unconstitutional,'' said <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, an attorney representing an anti-nuclear group whose fairness complaint against a <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, television station led to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s repeal of the doctrine. The court's decision `` leaves the door wide open for congressional action to codify the Fairness Doctrine,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, chairman of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, a constitutional liberties group. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., whose Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee held hearings on a new fairness bill Thursday, also said the court's decision gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the green light to pass the measure `` I pledge that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s ill-considered decision to repeal the Fairness Doctrine will be remedied at expeditiously as possible,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the court `` has vindicated the public's right to receive broadcast press coverage free from government interference. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would veto a Fairness Doctrine bill. Proponents have said they expect a First Amendment test in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. All three judges concurred in Friday's ruling, although there were partial dissents. In its complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, the anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said that <ORGANIZATION> WTVH </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Meredith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> station, had not presented conflicting views when the station ran a series of advertisements in 1982 that said the Nine Mile 2 nuclear power plant was a `` sound investment for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the anti-nuclear group, and <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 on grounds the Fairness Doctrine violated its First Amendment rights. But the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> denied the petition, saying the constitutional question should be left in the hands of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the courts. However, in January 1987 the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to consider the constitutional challenge. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stepped in and wrote the doctrine into law, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the bill in June 1987 before the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> repealed the doctrine. Writing for the court Friday, Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said `` The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision that the Fairness Doctrine no longer served the public interest was neither arbitrary, capricious nor an abuse of discretion.''

 Gray seals, thinned out by past hunting and chemical pollution, face a new threat this spring because warm temperatures have melted away their calving areas on the Baltic ice. The national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that 100 seals had gathered near <LOCATION> Soderhamn </LOCATION> along the central <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast, apparently in search of the ice floes where they usually bear their young. Most of the Baltic is ice-free, and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is more than halfway through the mildest winter in recorded history. An estimated 1,500 gray seals remain in the Baltic. The seals numbered about 100,000 in 1900, but were hunted through most of this century because they compete with commercial fishermen for their catch.

<HEAD>Police Call for Ban on Sale of Assault Rifles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sale of rapid-fire assault rifles like the one used last month in a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, shooting spree that left five children dead and 29 more wounded should be outlawed, the nation's police are telling lawmakers `` In my judgment, these weapons have to go,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> Friday as it opened hearings on assault rifles. The hearing spotlighted a bill being sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that would ban the sale of AK-47s, Uzis and other military-style, semiautomatic rifles as well as shotguns equipped with drum magazines that can fire 12 blasts in three seconds. Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, policeman and executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, had a blunt message for the committee. `` Our streets are becoming a combat zone,'' he said. `` Prompt and decisive action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is needed.'' On display was an arsenal of grease guns and semiautomatic pistols as well as such standbys as the semiautomatic adaptation of the AK47, long the basic weapon of Communist infantrymen from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> used an AK47 on Jan. 17 when he opened fire on 400 children on a playground outside the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Five children died and 29 children were injured as well as one teacher The hearing fell silent as <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, a teacher at the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> school, told how she and her pupils huddled on their classroom floor while shots crackled across the schoolyard and the shadow of the gunman crossed back and forth across their window. `` We hoped that he would not notice that we were there and that he would maybe think that we were at recess too,'' she said. Since then, she said, nightmares and fear of strangers have plagued her pupils. She said she has become distrustful and winces at unexpected sounds. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill is being opposed by gun groups on grounds that it would outlaw not only so-called assault rifles but also traditional hunting rifles with a semiautomatic capacity. In fact, there is no functional difference between the two, testified <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, acting deputy associate director for law enforcement of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> scoffed at the notion that there was no way to outlaw assault rifles without also banning the guns of legitimate hunters. `` It seems to me that we're smart enough to do it,'' he said. `` I can tell you -LRB- the difference -RRB- because I've had two police officers killed with assault weapons,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` Gang members love these weapons because in their drive-by shootings they do n't have to be marksmen, they do n't have to be sportsmen, all they have to do is spray,'' the chief said. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> episode showed that the AK-47 was not meant for use `` in a duck blind.'' `` We know of only one instance in which this was used for hunting,'' he said. `` When a psychopath in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> went hunting school children.'' Representatives of some of the nation's gun-owner groups argued that firearms themselves are not the problem. The <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> incident `` reflects a breakdown in the criminal justice system,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, public affairs director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Keep and Bear Arms. He urged tougher laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill conflicted with the Second Amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing citizens the right to keep and bear arms. `` It is just the kind of ill-considered legislation that the Second Amendment was designed to prevent,'' he told <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in his first domestic trip as vice president, gave a pair of speeches on human rights and democracy, singling out <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as needing improvement. In remarks to the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night, the vice president attacked <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as `` an obstacle to democracy and human rights for the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> people and people throughout the region.'' `` It is a country that has compiled a record of brutality and oppression that is without parallel in the history of our hemisphere. And it is a country whose leader has come to personify they tyranny that the rest of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is trying to cast off once and for all.'' Similarly, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attacked <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, accusing the Sandinista government of driving its citizens into exile through repression of freedom, thus causing the massive influx of refugees into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration currently backs the diplomatic efforts ongoing in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in lieu of military aid to the Contra rebels, but added, `` We will not yield in our determination to end <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s threat to democracy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> also must do better on human rights. Mentioning his trip to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last Friday, in which he warned the government and military that their sizable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid might be jeopardized if the country's human rights record did not improve, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the Cuban-American group, `` I believe I succeeded in getting my message across.'' While <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statistics show that political murders have declined from a high of 750 per month there in 1980 to 18 per month in 1988, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that figure ` is still unacceptable.'' But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> blamed the worst human rights abuses in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on the leftist guerrillas trying to overthrow the democratic government. Earlier in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reinforced the recent <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that faulted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces for excessive measures against <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civilians. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the number of civilian deaths in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were `` clearly unacceptable.'' Still, the vice president promised, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to strengthen longstanding and close U.S.-Israeli ties.

 A jury found a man guilty of capital murder Friday in the shooting and strangulation deaths of 14 family members then recommended that he be sentenced to die for the killings. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> accepted the recommendation and set an execution day of March 16 for <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> after <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> told the judge he know of no reason why he should not be immediatedly sentenced. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who already faces the death penalty in two other slayings, did n't visibly react to the verdict or the sentence but several people in the courtroom applauded. Jurors deliberated more than four hours before reaching a verdict, and three hours later announced a sentencing recommendation. They could have recommended life imprisonment with no parole. Prosecuting attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> told the jury that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> deserved the death penalty because he killed some of the victims to avoid arrest before he completed his plan to kill them all. `` Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life, `` <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> told the jury. `` That's where we are now in this case. That's old and ancient and hard. But that is what we are down to in this case.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> did not kill to escape detection. ` His motive was not to avoid arrest, but to satisfy a base, primeval and vile human passion,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said in asking the jury to recommend life imprisonment. `` And then we can say a jury stood staunch against an onslaught of publicity,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 48, has already been sentenced to die for the slayings of two people during a 40-minute shooting rampage on Dec. 28, 1987, in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. After his arrest, authorities searching his home near <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> found the bodies of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wife, his seven children, two of the children's spouses, and four grandchildren. They had been all been shot or strangled. As the jury deliberated, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said he had received <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' permission to appeal if he was convicted <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had waived appeal on his earlier conviction. In his closing statement, defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said there was no evidence that placed <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> at his home at the time of the deaths nor any evidence that he personally fired the gun he gave police when he was arrested. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> told the jury that the state was asking the jury to convict <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> on the basis of circumstantial evidence. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said that the evidence, though circumstantial, was strong, including evidence that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was driving his dead son's car when arrested, owned the gun and and had it in his possession. He also said the bodies were found at his house and that the burial of seven bodies and the hiding of two others showed that `` this was not the work of some phantom passer-by.'' During the trial Friday, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> slugged <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> in front of the jury, sending spectators shrieking and ducking beneath their seats. Law enforcement officers posted around the courtroom immediately swarmed over <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, subdued him and whisked him out a side door. After a recess, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was brought back in handcuffs, and the state completed its case early in the afternoon. The defense did not call any witnesses. `` I'm all right,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON>, who was hit on the chin as the attorneys and defendant huddled in conference at the judge's bench `` He just got me one time.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who had immediately ordered the startled jurors removed from the courtroom, brought them back before declaring a recess. `` I want you to set aside what happened in the courtroom just now,'' said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. `` This trial has gone on five days. We want to finish it if we can. You need to disregard the incident that happened here today.'' After the recess, Lt. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> of the Pope County sheriff's office read a five-page note found in <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' safety-deposit box in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> The jammed courtroom was hushed during the eight minutes that <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> needed to enter the statement into evidence. The statement was to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' eldest daughter, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>. She was killed along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. Family members say <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> had fathered the 6-year-old. `` I told you that your lack of communication with me was going to be your downfall,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> wrote. `` You have destroyed me and in time, you will destroy yourself. `` If you are trying to hurt me, then you should be very proud of yourself, because you have done a very good job of it. You have destroyed me. I do not want D. to set foot on my property. He turned you against me. You want me out of your life. I will be out of your life. I will see you in hell.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> sat with downcast eyes while the statement was read. Shortly after <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> finished, the state rested its case. After a break, the defense said it would stand on its previous motions. In testimony before the morning disruption, firearms expert <PERSON> Burwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> of the state Crime Lab in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> testified that a .22 - caliber revolver <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> handed over when he was arrested fired the bullets that killed several of the family

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he's putting the volatile issue of congressional pay raises on the back burner, delaying any new move until `` the timing is right.'' Chatting with reporters en route to this seacoast resort from a summit in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there had been `` a lot of wounds, a lot of hemorrhaging'' on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> over the pay raises. The president said that while he signed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation rejecting a 51 percent pay raise, he still believes in a substantial increase for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the federal judiciary and top government executives. Closing out the third full week of his presidency, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday: _ Gave <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> personal assurances that he would move as quickly as possible to attack the acid rain pollution problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which also has harmed <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s environment But the president gave the Canadian prime minister no precise timetables for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-burning plants, mostly in the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was `` reasonably well satisfied'' with his statements on the issue. _ Said he had not talked to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about reports that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> faces a potential conflict-of-interest problem `` I know there is nobody more ethical than <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as he headed to his family compound for a weekend of relaxation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> he is seeking a waiver from ethical requirements so he could continue to hold stock in <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a bank holding company that has lent some $ 4.5 billion to Third World countries. _ Maintained there is no inflation scare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, despite fresh producer price figures showing a full percentage point increase during January This translated into an annual inflation rate of 12.7 percent. `` I would not make assumptions based on one monthly release,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And I am not overly concerned about inflation at this point.'' He did say, however, that `` I do n't like the figures.'' _ Said that `` I'm very pleased'' with congressional reaction to the $ 1.16 trillion fiscal 1990 budget he proposed to a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged his plan did not go into detail on what areas of spending should be cut, saying `` there's a big black hole in the budget.'' But he also said that `` I did what I said I'd do: Here's what I want to do.'' He said he was `` certainly conscious of the fact'' that there would be arguments with lawmakers over spending priorities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned a relatively quiet weekend with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and other family members. He said he likely would go to church Sunday, and hinted that he might go out jogging, saying that he had been unable to get enough exercise recently because he suffered from a cold. On the lingering question of pay raises for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, judges and senior executives, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retreated somewhat from his statement of last Wednesday, when he suggested he would propose a new pay package in the wake of the congressional defeat of the 51 percent raise. `` All I can do is make recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the future legislation,'' he said. But he said that `` I do n't want to do something that'll look like I am simply trying to step into the breach and raise a problem that already has caused a great deal of divisiveness in the Capitol.'' `` That's not what I want to do,'' he said. `` I've got to rely on my people here to make a recommendation to me when I can be effective for the changes that I think are overdue,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But what you do n't want to do is come in and, when the wounded are still lying on the battlefield, and start fighting another battle,'' he said. `` Let's take a little time. ... I'm not sure the timing is right. I think we've got to let the dust settle over that battlefield.''

 A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> couple's attempt to perform one of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s `` Stupid Human Tricks'' did n't exactly go as planned, but it certainly qualified for the title. Police had to rescue <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burmeister </PERSON> after they folded themselves, naked, into a collapsible sofa bed and could n't get out. Authorities say <PERSON> Cerney </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Burmeister </PERSON> were trying to replicate a feat performed by a <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crosse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, man on `` Stupid Human Tricks,'' an offshoot of `` Stupid Pet Tricks'' on <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s late-night television show However, the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> man, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, managed to extricate himself from his spring-loaded trap. In the copycat attempt, Ms. <PERSON> Burmeister </PERSON> was only able to free enough of her body to reach a telephone and summon help. Sgt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Winona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said he was amazed that the couple could fit into a folded sofa bed.

 The meadowlark is a `` deserter.'' The magpie is `` murderous'' and `` thieving.'' So which one should be the state bird of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>? The question will be taken up by the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> this session, and emotions are running pretty high. The present state bird is the meadowlark, but Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> says it deserts the state every winter, just when residents need cheering up most. Enter the magpie, the black-and-white scavenger of the Plains. `` He's pretty; he's easily seen along almost any highway in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> even at temperatures of up to 40 and 50 below; he is no fair-weather friend,'' <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> said recently. `` He is the magpie.'' But such talk does n't always sit well with Montanans. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, a humor columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, endorsed the magpie as state bird two years ago, prompting a flock of angry letters. Magpies eat the eggs of more desirable birds and peck through the hides of cows, readers wrote.

Just as things were getting ugly, the Yellowstone Chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> stepped in and _ depending on one's outlook _ either defended the magpie or defamed the bald eagle. `` We know that in some quarters the bird is n't highly thought of,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> said, people `` just do n't realize he's in the same class as the American eagle. He eats dead things.''

 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s top trade official wants the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take the lead in resolving a trans-Atlantic dispute touched off by a ban on imports of hormone-treated meat from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 1 banned imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to comply and slapped stiff duties on a variety of European products. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to strike back with retaliatory tariffs. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the newly appointed trade chief for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged finding a solution will be difficult. `` I do n't know what can be done. What we can not do is change fundamentally our legislation -LRB- banning the meat -RRB-,'' he said in an interview Friday in his office at the headquarters of the 12-nation trading bloc. The Europeans contend the stimulants pose a health risk, a claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> disputes. American farmers use the hormones to boost growth rates in cattle. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, a former Dutch finance minister, said he intends to discuss the troublesome issue next week when he travels to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. He said he recently talked on the telephone to Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and both agreed `` we should do lots of thinking to find some kind of solution because ... nobody wants this matter to escalate.'' Still, he said, the initiative should come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think they should start. We are thinking as well -LRB- but -RRB- our possibilities are limited -LRB- since -RRB- we believe that this -LRB- legislation -RRB- is in complete conformity with our international obligations,'' he said. `` So I think some kind of signal -LRB- from the -RRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be very helpful,'' he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has received no fresh proposals from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Thursday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blocked a European demand for an international investigation of the American retaliatory measures, saying more contacts between the giant trading partners would be useful. European foreign ministers gather in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Feb. 20 to decide whether to apply counter-retaliatory measures against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The ministers threatened last month to impose high duties on imports of American dried fruit and walnuts if no progress was made in resolving the dispute. `` The actions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until now are not very encouraging,'' <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said. The ban is expected to block the import of about $ 100 million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Meat used to make pet food is exempt. Total trade between the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reached an estimated $ 166 billion last year. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> dismissed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns that the Common Market would try to build up barriers to foreign goods as it moved closer to forming a single market of the 12 countries in 1992. He said the European nations depend on trade with other countries to sell their exports and buy needed imports and have no reason to create a fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It is not -LRB- in -RRB- our interest, and it's not our intention, and it will not be the result,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sates </LOCATION> is a very good client as we are very good clients for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Sometimes I've asked myself in agriculture, ` Why is it that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is always quarreling with its best client?''' he said. `` I do n't understand that.'' Common Market members are <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A by-election Sunday is seen as a test of the damage done to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s party by a stock-trading scandal that has forced the resignation of three Cabinet members. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is battling hard to retain the party's control of a parliament seat of a member who died Dec. 23. The voting, on the southern island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>, is the first election to a national office since the scandal began last summer. Some newspapers predict the leading opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, could win, dealing a serious blow to the Liberal Democrats. Suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling have <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> facing opposition pressure to resign or to at least account for his links to the information services conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The election in <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> is viewed as an indicator of what could happen in July elections for half the upper house, where the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> hold 143 of the 251 seats. Severe setbacks in the elections would endanger <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s chances next October to win another two-year term as party president and prime minister, commentators say A poll conducted by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, shows Socialist <PERSON> Sadao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchigami </PERSON> with a slim lead over the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Kei </PERSON> <PERSON> Oma </PERSON>, the newspaper reported Friday. Two other opposition candidates _ <PERSON> Tatsuzen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Salaried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ are also contesting the seat. The uproar over Recruit began when it was discovered that founder <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> sold unlisted shares in the Recruit subsiary at bargain prices to more than 150 influential politicians, bureaucrats, journalists and businessmen before the shares began trading publicly in October 1986. Share prices rose sharply then, and some shareholders gained more than $ 80,000 in profits that were tax free because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has no capital gains tax. The scandal has cost <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> three Cabinet ministers and his popularity has plunged, prompting him to announce a review of government ethics. `` I have vowed to myself that I must honestly accept the harsh criticism ... must join hands with you, and must restore the people's trust in politics,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told parliament Friday. He called political reform his `` No. 1 priority issue.'' Many lawmakers say without campaign finance reform, nothing can be done to remove the network of obligations and expenses that traditionally link businessmen and politicians. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a gift-giving society, and politicians gain voter support by presenting cash gifts at funerals and weddings of their constituents. A typical legislator also has to spend more than $ 790,000 a year on personnel, office rental, phone and mailing costs, said <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aichi </PERSON> in a letter to his constituents. The government pays salaries of only two staff members, and no matching government funds exist to help finance campaigns. Politicians devote enormous efforts to raising money, leaning on businesses and colleagues to buy tickets to fund-raising parties. In return, business circles expect some political influence.

 Three Cuban crewmen were missing Friday and 13 others injured after their darkened, drifting cargo vessel was sliced in two by a cruise liner off the coast of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, shipping and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. None of the 1,500 vacationing passengers and 600 crew members aboard the Miami-based Celebration were injured in the pre-dawn collision, which caused only minor damage to the liner's port bow, said <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadieu </PERSON>. The 734-foot Celebration rescued 42 of the 45 crew members aboard the Cuban cement hauler Capitan <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION>, including one whose foot was severed in the accident. `` In an interview with the captain of the cruise ship, the second officer aboard the Cuban freighter said that the Cuban vessel had been experiencing electrical problems,'' Carnival spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. `` The electrical problem left the Cuban vessel without navigational lights or steering.'' A Cuban navy frigate and tug picked up the 42 rescued crew members Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency later reported that the injured passengers were being treated at the <ORGANIZATION> Comandante </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pedro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sotto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` Basically, we've relinquished our search and rescue responsibilities to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The three missing men were apparently in a cabin at the stern of the 350-foot freighter, which sank when the Celebration sliced it in two, said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The bow section floated for hours before sinking at about 10 a.m. The three missing crewmen included the ship's Capt. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazco </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, 34, along with <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> los </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyre </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 40, all of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> reported. The freighter was en route from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> at the time of the collision, the agency said. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and Falcon jet had searched the site Friday morning and cutters were on the way when the Cubans said they would take over the rescue. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials said they want to investigate the incident even though it involved a Liberian-registered cruise liner and a Cuban freighter. `` We do n't have jurisdiction, but we are expecting that <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> will grant us permission to go aboard when the ship arrives Saturday,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We want to look at the ship and talk in particular to the crew on the bridge at the time.'' The transportation board has conducted a series of hearings in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on cruise line safety. Ms. <PERSON> Cadieu </PERSON> said the cruise line and their insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, also would conduct their own probe. The collision occurred in heavily traveled shipping lanes only 20 miles off <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guarico </LOCATION> near the eastern tip of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said there was no information yet on whether the accident caused a major oil spill but said it was likely fuel tanks were split aboard the Capitan <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> when it was cut in half. The Celebration, which Ms. <PERSON> Cadieu </PERSON> said has the world's largest floating casino, was on its way back to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after a seven-day cruise that included stops at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>.

 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the leader of last week's coup, has accepted the governing party's endorsement for president in elections scheduled for May 1. Opposition leaders meanwhile planned a rally today to postpone the balloting. The acceptance Friday by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> came one week after he engineered a military coup that toppled <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s president since 1954, and left at least 50 people dead. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, was exiled Monday to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.

Scheduled to attend the rally are former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>; Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Riart </PERSON>, spokesman for the National Accord opposition coalition As ambassador, <PERSON> White </PERSON> had enraged the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime by supporting opposition groups and making pro-democracy statements that offended <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s leadership. White was beaten by Paraguayan police at <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>'s airport when, as former ambassador, he accompanied <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> as the opposition leader attempted to return to his homeland in 1986. Authorities put White on the first flight out of the country. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s candidacy was announced by <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappalardo </PERSON>, secretary-general of Government House. `` <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> offered Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> the candidacy on the occasion of the first meeting of the national Cabinet, and the president accepted,'' <PERSON> Pappalardo </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chaves </ORGANIZATION> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Argana </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> president and initial front-runner, is foreign minister. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> appointed both hours after his soldiers forced <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> out of power. <PERSON> Pappalardo </PERSON> repeated the provisional government's intention to hold elections May 1. <PERSON> Euclides </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, president of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said some opposition groups may boycott elections they are n't allowed more time to organize for what would be the first participation in elections for some. The rally was set before <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s ouster. Its initial purpose was to protest alleged fraud in February 1988 elections in which <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a lopsided eighth straight victory. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> say that under the constitution, elections must be held within 90 days. The opposition argues that the constitution is suspended since the provisional government seized power in a coup. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Ambassasdor <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Towell </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to communicate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of the new government. <PERSON> Towell </PERSON> said he stressed policies in favor of human rights and democracy and against drug trafficking. He told reporters, `` We will be judging the quality of our relations on the degree in which they move forward in all of these areas.''

<HEAD>Newspapers Report Horror Stories of Soviet Pollution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Toxic materials saturate a lake near one Siberian city to such an extent that stray dogs are regularly tossed into the water to disintegrate. A chemical plant on the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is so hazardous that employees routinely take medical retirement at the age of 45. The rate of sickness from natural gas poisoning was so high in one village that the entire town was moved away from a gas processing plant. Those environmental horror stories are just three of the items that appeared Friday in Soviet newspapers, an indication not only of the sorry state of the environment but the new aggressiveness the media has acquired for environmental reporting. Such reporting is now sanctioned under the regime of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as good citizenship rather than anti-Soviet treachery. In the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Kemerovo </LOCATION>, stray dogs that are not sent to research laboratories or converted into fur boots and hats are simply tossed into a lake filled with toxic phenols from a local chemical plant, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` After several days, no trace is left,'' the newspaper said. It was not clear if the paper was referring to live or dead dogs being tossed into the river. Pravda reported that the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Chapaevsk </LOCATION> is known locally as `` the city of young pensioners'' because the chemical factory there retires so many people when they reach 45 to 50 years of age. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s air contains double the allowable amount of hydrocarbons, and that ceilings on nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are exceeded by 30 percent. It said city water contains five to 20 times the permitted amount of fertilizers and other toxic chemicals. The paper said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> already has moved 174 factories outside the city limits in hopes of reducing its pollution problem. Authorities had hoped to move 446 factories outside the city by 1990, but it now appears that goal will not be reached until the year 2000, the newspaper said. The entire village of <LOCATION> Muzhichya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavlovka </LOCATION> has been moved away from a local gas processing plant after 76 people suffered natural gas poisoning in January, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nedelya </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Brushes Aside Reports He Will Step Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Veteran Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> sought to play down reports he will step down or call early elections in the face of union conflicts that have set off fears of sustained labor unrest. At a news conference Friday, the 46-year-old <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, appearing confident and relaxed, said the unions could not determine his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policies. Responding to rumors of his early resignation, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said: `` In politics, to comment about these things does nothing more than contribute to an increase in rumors.'' He said conflict with the unions would not affect <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s current six-month presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. `` This work will not be affected by a greater or lesser amount of social conflict,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> also pledged that his 6-year-old government would make `` a maximum effort to keep on track'' <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s annual 5 percent economic growth rate, the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The prime minister's comments came three days after the collapse of six weeks of talks between the government and unions over unemployment and pension benefits. The collapse set off fears of labor strife expected to last through the spring. `` Some political leaders have called either for my resignation or new elections,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders who propose this that perhaps I'd like to consider it, but not for the reasons that they, logically, want.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was referring to a call for his resignation Wednesday by leaders of a small leftist parliamentary coalition. The coalition believes that elections now would favor them because the Socialists have lost voter support. Elections must be held by June 1990. A poll published last week in the newsweekly <ORGANIZATION> Cambio </ORGANIZATION> 16 indicated the Socialists would receive 35 percent of the vote if elections were called now, a drop from the 44 percent they won in June 1986 elections. The Socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of Parliament. Last December the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ally, and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissions </ORGANIZATION> staged a general strike that brought <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to a standstill for 24 hours. After a nearly seven-hour negotiation session Tuesday, the unions rejected a government offer of $ 3.3 billion to broaden unemployment insurance, increase basic pensions and raise the minimum wage. They maintained their demand for increased benefits totaling $ 3.6 billion. The prime minister said the collapse of the talks `` is not just a failure for the government, but also a failure for the unions.'' He said maintaining <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s high economic growth rate was fundamental to reducing the country's 18.8 percent unemployment, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest. `` In governing, sometimes it's preferable to put at risk one's loss of popularity than to assume the risk of not taking advantage of the opportunities'' for economic growth, he said

 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> condition worsened to critical when he began running a fever, a hospital official said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, was in critical but stable condition Friday night, said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He had been in guarded condition earlier in the day. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in the hospital's intensive care unit and was still breathing with the aid of a respirator, <PERSON> Kop </PERSON> said. She declined to elaborate. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been in the hospital for nearly a month with pneumonia and bronchial asthma. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' worsened condition `` means there is infection again.'' `` I would suspect it's the lungs because of the tracheostomy,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. In a tracheostomy, a surgical incision is made in the trachea to create an artificial breathing hole. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> underwent the emergency surgery Feb. 1 to relieve a buildup of fluid in his lungs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, have been living in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ouster in February 1986.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, who rose from small-town mayor to one of the most powerful positions in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> only to see his career ruined by a sex-and-payroll scandal in 1976, died of a heart attack. He was 77. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> served 14 terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and earned a reputation as a tough, effective legislator feared by those who crossed him. But he is remembered mainly for his liaison with <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clerk who declared: `` I ca n't type, I ca n't file, I ca n't even answer the phone.'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> suffered a heart attack at home around 1:15 p.m. Friday, said his second wife, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>. He died a little more than an hour later at <LOCATION> Wheeling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby Wheeling, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said her husband was reading a book about <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> before suffering the attack. A private funeral was set for Monday. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, who was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1948, resigned on Sept. 1, 1976, halting a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigation into his affair with Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. The scandal broke in the spring of 1976, when Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, then 33, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> about her relationship with the congressman. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> initially denied the report, saying, `` Hell's fire! I'm a very happily married man.'' He subsequently acknowledged the affair, but denied Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s allegation that he was paying her $ 14,000 a year in federal money only to have sex with him After <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> resigned, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which also was investigating the matter, decided not to prosecute, citing a lack of evidence corroborating Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s account of her relationship with <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Bannock </LOCATION>, a community of 350 people in the coal fields of eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. After studying at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> universities, he began teaching history and public speaking at a high school near his hometown. He was elected mayor of nearby <LOCATION> Flushing </LOCATION>, a town of 1,200 people, in 1939, and later served briefly in the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In 1948, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> won his first term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He became chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> two years later. The former job gave him significant power within the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, because the <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> controlled everything from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurants to staff payrolls. Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> `` ran his committee with the iron hand of absolute control.'' `` He was fierce in his attack and would take on anyone in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on an issue in which he had an interest,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, dean of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s Democratic delegation in the House. `` If you did n't stand up to him he did n't have much respect for you.'' Despite <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reputation as the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> bully, many of his heavily blue-collar constituency saw him as a man who got things done, such as pushing through pensions for black-lung coal disease victims or getting official documents such as Army discharge papers and passports. Even after his relationship with Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> became known, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> won the 1976 primary for his congressional seat with 62 percent of the vote. But the scandal ended his hopes of running for governor. Two days after the primary, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> was rushed to a hospital in a coma from an overdose of sleeping tablets. He emerged from the coma in less than 24 hours but remained in the hospital for nine days. He said the overdose was accidental. After leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> returned to a 300-acre farm where he bred angus cattle and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> walking horses. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> was elected in 1978 to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where, except for an incident in which he threatened to punch a television cameraman, he kept a low profile. He lost his re-election bid in 1980, but became chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Belmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> and his first wife, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>, were divorced in 1976 after 38 years of marriage. That same year, he married <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>. In addition to his wife, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> is survived by a daughter and two grandchildren.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> arrived today in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, beginning her first official visit abroad by following in the footsteps of her late father, who cultivated close ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was greeted by about 200 screaming Pakistani residents at the city's old airport, which is used for important guests. `` Long live <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>,'' read banners carried by the crowd. `` Long Live Pakistan-China Friendship.'' In a break with normal procedure, the 35-year-old prime minister did not immediately get in a waiting limousine. Instead, she walked the line of well-wishers shaking hands and saying hi. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are very close and friendly,'' she told <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in an interview before her departure. `` My visit would give a further boost to these relations.'' This is <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s third visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She came in the early 1970s at the invitation of the late Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>, and with her father, the late prime minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on a state visit in 1976. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> became prime minister after national elections in November. Soon after she took office, she traveled to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on a personal visit to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s predecessor, the late President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, died in a suspicious plane crash in August. While in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> will meet with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders and is expected to sign two agreements of limited importance _ a barter trade agreement and an agreement on the mutual protection of investment. On Sunday, she meets Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>; on Monday she flies to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for meetings with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the issue of the Afghan war would dominate <PERSON> Bhuto </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have been the main backers of the Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are expected to discuss their next step as the Feb. 15 deadline for a Soviet withdrawal approaches. It is significant that <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> chose <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as her first official destination. Despite momentous political changes _ coups and wars in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the Cultural Revolution in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ the relationship between the two countries has improved steadily since January 1950 when <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> first recognized <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> herself, the Chinese have done a great deal in the short time she has been in office. In the three days after the general election in November, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> met with <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> three times in highly publicized meetings Given <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s close relationship with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s powerful military, the move was a clear sign of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s support of an orderly transfer of power in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, Asian diplomats said. For <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the visit comes at a time of great fluidity in its relations with the rest of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s improving ties with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> no longer make <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> a natural ally. But factors such as the close relationship with the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> military guarantee close ties for some time to come. Indeed, 50 percent of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s 400-plane air force comes from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as do 1,100 of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s 1,600 tanks, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sells more weapons to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also helps <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with its nuclear industry. The two countries signed an agreement in September 1986. Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have denied the aid has military applications, but Western diplomats say they are convinced that cooperation in this field is not limited to electricity. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was among the first countries to recognize <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was established in 1949. Relations between the two countries were very good during the administration of <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, who visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> three times when he was president and prime minister from 1971-76. The relationship improved even more under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who ousted the elder <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in a coup and had him hanged in 1979. The introduction of hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> further boosted the ties.

Bitung is about 1,440 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. `` About 25 tremors were recorded, but there were no reports of damage or casualties,'' <PERSON> Puja </PERSON> said. The National Earthquake Information Center, operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said it recorded an earthquake measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale in the <LOCATION> Taluad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 900 miles southeast of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. There were no initial reports of damage or casualties. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

Ms. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> and 10 others are living free of malignancy after receiving four new abdominal organs and being left with little or no stomach, said transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're pushing ourselves to the limit,'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said in an interview. The transplants, believed to be the first of their kind, have been performed on 10 men and three women since June at Presbyterian-University. Two patients died, one of them following a second transplant, <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. `` It's a phenomenal accomplishment,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, professor of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION>, who keeps a worldwide transplant tumor registry. `` To keep patients alive successfully with a big operation like this indicates that transplantation is really advancing.'' All 13 patients were near death and their tumors were inoperable, <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. All but the most recent survivors, including Ms. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> _ who underwent the surgery Jan. 13 _ are home. The latest transplant was performed Monday. Surgical teams removed each patient's liver, pancreas, most or all of the stomach, two-thirds of the colon, and the duodenum, a 10-inch-long section of the small intestine. The cavity was filled with a block of organs consisting of the liver, pancreas, duodenum and jejunum, a few feet of section of the small intestine. The stomach was not replaced since it is non-essential for digestion, which can be performed by intestines, <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. Because she has no stomach, Ms. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> must eat six small meals a day spaced an hour or two apart. Half a sandwich easily fills her up. `` You try not to drink with your meals because liquid takes up the space. You know when you've had enough,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, who expects to be discharged in a few days. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said the procedure is `` a mini-version'' of the five-organ transplants performed next door at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on two 3-year-olds. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, survived six months before dying in May 1988 and Rolandrea Dodge of <LOCATION> Fruitland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, died last month, six weeks after surgery. Both girls died of lymphoproliferative disease, an abnormal proliferation of lymphoids, or white blood cells, that obstructed the liver, officials said. Each had received a new liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and part of a large intestine. `` We need better tools'' such as anti-rejection medication for transplants involving the entire digestive system, <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. `` We need to be able to manage these so-called lymphoids.'' Abdominal transplantation involving multiple organs `` is not an all-or-none procedure,'' he said. `` The soundness of the surgery is exemplified by the -LRB- 13 -RRB- procedures.'' As of Dec. 31, about 1,100 people with malignant tumors had undergone liver, kidney, heart or bone marrow transplants worldwide, according to <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>. Eight months of cancer-free survival following a multiple-organ transplant is `` revolutionary,'' he said. `` What he's trying to do is ... remove the entire tumor plus all areas where it's most likely to spread to in hopes of curing the cancer altogether,'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said. `` There's one catch _ if the cancer has spread -LRB- undetected -RRB- beyond the limits of his dissection.'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said he is limiting the new procedure, at least for now, to cancer patients less than 45 years old. `` It's a limited operation at present. We have to see what happens,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Teperman </PERSON>, part of the transplant team. `` But I think it's a giant step forward.''

<HEAD>UNIFIL Officer Reprimanded For Comparing Israeli Actions to Nazis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Swedish commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has reprimanded a Norwegian officer for comparing Israeli army actions there to those of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in World War II, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> source said. The source at <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Lars-Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahlgren </PERSON> reprimanded Lt. Col. J.E. <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON>, commander of the Norwegian battalion, on Thursday. He spoke on condition of anonymity and did give any other details. <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> made the remark Feb. 2 during a private meeting between Israeli and <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> officers to discuss the expulsions of 79 Lebanese villagers from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It was leaked to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media. The Israeli Foreign Ministry initially protested <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON>'s remark, then demanded his removal after he said in a newspaper interview that the comparison succeeded in drawing attention to the expulsion of the Lebanese villagers `` In World War II my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in the struggle against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> who were trying to expel Jews from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Nowadays you behave in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> exactly as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> did,'' <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, reached by telephone, said <PERSON> Wahlgren </PERSON> called <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> to an hourlong meeting at the force headquarters in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>. He refused to elaborate. Sixty-five of the deportees were from <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>'s Norwegian-patrolled zone <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has lodged a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council against the expulsions. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 37 of those expelled were from the Sunni Moslem village of <LOCATION> Shibaa </LOCATION>, which refused to cooperate with the Israeli-supported south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> army militia that patrols the security zone with Israeli troops. The 5,800-strong <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, drawn from nine nations, mans a narrow strip north of the security zone. It has been deployed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 1978. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the six-to-10-mile-wide strip when it withdrew the bulk of its occupation army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985. The strip, which extends from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast in the west to the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> in the east, serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Inflation Inches Upward In Mexico, Capital Flight Stops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says the lowest January price rise in 11 years and the return to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of about $ 700 million in capital last month is proof its anti-inflation plan is working. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> said consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in January, the lowest for that month since 1978, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The National Consumer Price Index rose by 0.9 percent the latter half of the month, the central bank said. Higher prices for services, rents, telephones, medicines and automotive insurance rates spurred January inflation, it said. Still, inflationary momentum has inched upward in recent months, with prices rising by 2.1 percent in December. The previous highest monthly inflation rate was 3.1 percent in April. The government froze wages, prices and the peso exchange rate in February 1988 in a bid to curb inflation that reached a record 159.2 percent in 1987. Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent last year under the plan. The central bank, in its monthly publication, said an estimated $ 700 million in capital returned to the country last month. It said investors were encouraged by a gradual peso currency devaluation instituted on Jan. 1 and lower domestic interest rates. The devaluation has averaged one peso per day. Analysts have said the government adopted the devaluation to thwart investor speculation that it was planning a major, one-time currency adjustment. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s international reserves plunged from $ 16 billion in April to less than $ 10 billion by December, according to private estimates. The run on reserves was attributed to fears of currency devaluation, pre-payments of private sector foreign debts and depressed revenues from oil, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s leading export commodity.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has been trying to tidy his economic and political house before a regional summit Monday, mindful that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> needs international help to save itself from economic disaster. But the opposition said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s proposals are merely window dressing and do not seriously address the political problems at the heart of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economic crisis. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, in meetings with opposition parties, raised the possibility of reforming electoral laws, calling early elections and granting amnesty to members of deposed President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> said Friday Thousands of guardsmen were imprisoned after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> took power in 1979, and in December the government said it still had more than 1,700 guardsmen in custody and 1,300 captured anti-Sandinista rebels. On Wednesday, the leftist Sandinista government made another conciliatory gesture, allowing two former <ORGANIZATION> Somoza </ORGANIZATION> military officers to leave the country after they had spent nearly 10 years at the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> under political asylum. An 18-month-old regional peace plan, which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> will try to revive at their summit, calls for democratic reforms, amnesties for political prisoners and talks with the internal opposition in the five countries. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> goes into the summit believing his forces have all but beaten the U.S.-supported guerrilla movement, although scattered fighting still occurs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Central American nations have been demanding <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government make more democratic reforms, as promised. `` If in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> there is no democratization, there wo n't be a lasting peace,'' <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Marxist-Leninist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview Friday. `` If the government agrees to allow freedom of expression, the capitalists will start investing, the market comes alive,'' <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said. `` That's what they -LRB- businessmen -RRB- want: a guarantee.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the government failed to comply with the regional peace plan while making it appear it is seeking business and opposition support for recent austerity measures `` under the guise of a pretended economic and political agreement.'' The coalition of private business groups, labor unions and political parties also urged the government to agree to constitutional reforms to ensure freedom of expression and changes in laws that now `` guarantee Sandinista control over the results of any election.'' Elections for posts from president to town mayors are scheduled for November 1990. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> needs the injections of money that Western lending markets can provide. Those sources dried up after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed a trade embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1985, four years after the rebels began receiving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is firmly in power, but its rule could be threatened by the sharp budget cuts and layoffs it has outlined to contain runaway inflation. Inflation rates reached 20,000 percent last year and exports have fallen for five years. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> goes to the summit in dire need of foreign aid and loans for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that might be forthcoming only after political reforms. Opposition and business groups have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward the government's apparent attempts at rapprochement. `` Everybody talks about credibility,'' said <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have lied to us so many times we do n't believe them anymore.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> recently spoke of consolidating <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s `` historical victory'' over the Contra rebels and of normalizing relations with the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which he called more pragmatic than that of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 Six Tamils were killed in a clash between rival militant groups in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, and nine other people died in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists in the last 24 hours, police said today. Since early January when campaigning started for Wednesday's parliamentary elections, more than 1,000 people _ including 13 candidates _ have been killed Both Sinhalese extremists and Tamil rebels oppose the government and have vowed to prevent it from holding elections. A 12-year-old girl, <PERSON> Udanee </PERSON> <PERSON> Liyanaga </PERSON>, was killed when a bomb was hurled at a political rally Friday night in <LOCATION> Borella </LOCATION> on the eastern outskirts of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The bomb exploded as supporters of President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were lighting firecrackers at the end of the rally. Twenty people, including five young girls, were injured. Police blamed that attack and a series of shootings throughout the Sinhalese heartland on the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front, composed of ultranationalist Sinhalese, say the Sinhalese-dominated government has made too many concessions to the Tamil minority. In <LOCATION> Mannar </LOCATION>, 140 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, six Tamil militants died in a clash Friday between the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are the largest of the Tamil rebel groups that have been fighting the government since 1983 for an independent homeland. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who account for 75 percent of the population. More than 8,500 people have died in the Tamil insurrection.

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s unpredictable Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has decided to retake his post as president of the anti-Vietnam resistance, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said today. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> resigned `` irrevocably'' one year ago because of differences with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, one of the three factions in the resistance coalition. `` <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> now has resumed his post again as president'' of the resistance government, visiting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> said the 66-year-old prince conveyed his decision in a breakfast meeting today at <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s residence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. An aide to <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, contacted at the residence, confirmed the prince was again president of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION>, the resistance government. Earlier this week <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and other resistance leaders to map out strategy for peace talks to be held in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, later this month. At a Thursday news conference, <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> and his partners announced proposals for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the establishment of a four-party coalition government, which would include the Vietnam-backed Cambodian government of <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>. The resistance leaders, however, did not say anything about <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> returning to his official position. Despite <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s quitting as president, the resistance has continued to regard him as the only man with enough popular support to unite the nation It was not clear whether <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> had resolved his differences with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The prince last year cited <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> attacks on his guerrilla army as a main reason for his decision to step down as president. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> now says the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> must be part of any future coalition government. But in a statement Friday, he said, `` I solemnly declare that there is no question of letting Mr. <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> return to power.'' <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leader when the radical Communists ruled the country from 1975 to 1978, during which time an estimated about 2 million of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from executions, famine and civil unrest. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 to drive the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power. The resistance wants a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force to be put in place to ensure that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends its 10-year military incursion in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and to keep the peace after the Vietnamese leave. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which has said it will remove all its troops by September if a peace settlement is in place, opposes bringing in foreign military personnel. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it has 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> but Western estimates are much higher.

<HEAD>Drifter Sentenced To Life In Prison For Slaying Three Indian Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A drifter who posed as an <PERSON> American </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison for murdering and sexually mutilating three <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> women, a decision that was applauded by Indian activists. `` Everybody's happy,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, one of several <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> activists who were in the courtroom Friday night for the sentencing of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaze </PERSON>, 45. `` I think there is a sense of relief,'' added AIM member <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>. `` It has a tendency to restore my faith in the legal system and it alleviated some fears.'' Jurors convicted Glaze on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder in the slayings of <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullman </PERSON>, 19, <PERSON> Angeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitebird-Sweet </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 21, in 1986 and 1987. Police believe the women met their killer in taverns. Glaze showed no sign of emotion as the verdict was read earlier Friday night, but softly told <ORGANIZATION> Hennepin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedoff </PERSON>, `` I'm not the serial killer.'' <PERSON> Lebedoff </PERSON> sentenced him to three life sentences, to be served consecutively, making him eligible for parole in 52 -LCB- years. `` I have no reason to dispute the legitimacy of the findings of the jury,'' the judge said. Noting that <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> does not have the death penalty, he told Glaze it was his `` strong wish that you serve the rest of your life in prison.'' `` The horrors that we've been privy to over the last few weeks can not be undone by any sentence,'' <PERSON> Lebedoff </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing I can do to turn back the clock.'' The jury found that Glaze had killed the three women while sexually assaulting them, resulting in an automatic finding of first-degree murder under <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law. The conviction on second-degree murder charges reflects the jury's finding that the crimes were not premeditated. The 35 -LCB- - hour deliberations began Tuesday after a two-week trial During the trial, <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamblin </PERSON>, a transient, testified that he witnessed <PERSON> Bullman </PERSON>'s murder and identified Glaze as the killer. <PERSON> Hamblin </PERSON>, who said he had been drinking and smoking marijuana at the time, said he was afraid to stop the killing. Other prosecution witnesses testified that <PERSON> Glaze </PERSON> told them he had killed the women. Assistant Hennepin County Attorney <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, a prosecutor in the case, said in his closing statement that Glaze's motive was that he hated Indian women. `` He had a fury in his gut; he wanted to hurt them badly. He told people that,'' <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> said. But Glaze's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Colich </PERSON>, said the state had failed to prove that Glaze killed anyone. Glaze did not testify. He characterized Glaze as a non-violent drifter who called attention to himself by saying despicable things about women.

<HEAD>Three Fires Break Out In Manila Area, Thousands Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three mysterious fires broke out within hours of each other in metropolitan <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, leaving thousands of people homeless, police said today. The first fire broke out Friday afternoon in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s slum district of <LOCATION> Tondo </LOCATION>, touching off an eight-hour blaze that gutted about 2,000 houses, said arson investigator Sgt. <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimagiba </PERSON>. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, he said. At least three firemen and a woman suffered burns or minor injuries during the fire, <PERSON> Dimagiba </PERSON> said. He said several people, mostly children, were missing but there were no reports of deaths. Several <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers reported five people were missing and presumed to have died in the fire. Radio <ORGANIZATION> DZMM </ORGANIZATION> reported that among the dead was a looter who was beaten by irate fire victims and thrown into the blaze. The reports could not be immediately confirmed, <PERSON> Dimagiba </PERSON> said. He said firefighters had difficulty in putting out the fire because hundreds of shanties, made of cardboard and light-wooden materials, blocked many side streets. Dimagiba estimated 2,000 houses were razed in a four-block radius and up to 15,000 people had been rendered homeless by the fire because most of the houses are being shared by at least three families. `` They had to share small houses to minimize the cost of living,'' <PERSON> Dimagiba </PERSON> said. Two hours after the fire was put under control, a second fire of unknown origin began a street away and burned down four other houses, <PERSON> Dimagiba </PERSON> added. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, fire broke out this afternoon on the first floor of the a 12-story commercial building but firemen on the scene said the blaze was under control.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has agreed with advisers that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is no reason to cut military aid to the Afghan rebels, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` As long as -LRB- Afghan leader -RRB- <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> holds on, the potential and risk of Soviet activity is very much alive,'' the Times quoted an unidentified senior administration official as saying. `` If the administration took the policy decision to cut off aid because of Soviet good behavior, it would be hard to get started again if the Soviets start up again,'' the official said. The Times said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepted the recommendation to continue the aid as long as the Soviet-backed Afghan government is in power. The newspaper said senior foreign policy advisers suggested it at a Friday meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The Times quoted unidentified senior administration officials as saying that although the Soviets are withdrawing troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, they continue to leave behind large amounts of military equipment. Administration officials asserted that the decision does not reflect a change in policy, but rather a change in emphasis, the newspaper said. `` Our basic policy is support for the resistance,'' a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` Our policy remains one of positive symmetry.'' `` We never said our support to the rebels would be proportional to what the Soviets sent,'' the official added. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has repeatedly urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to discontinue aid to the rebels, especially in light of its withdrawal earlier this month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan rebels is estimated to have totaled $ 600 million last year.

 <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was sentenced to death for murdering 14 members of his family in a rampage that his own attorney said was motivated by `` a base, primeval and vile human passion.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who is already under a death sentence in two related slayings, was convicted and sentenced in rapid succession Friday, hours after he stunned jurors by attacking the prosecutor in his trial. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> accepted the jury's recommendation and set the execution for March 16 after <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said he knew of no reason why he should not be immediatedly sentenced. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 48, who was handcuffed after punching prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> earlier in the day, displayed no emotion as jurors returned the guilty verdicts at 8:30 p.m. He was similarly impassive when they returned less than three hours later with the sentence of death by lethal injection. `` Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life,'' <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said during closing arguments earlier in the day. `` That's where we are in this case. That's old and ancient and hard. But that is what we are down to in this case.'' The verdict and sentence brought a swift end to a brief trial that began with jury selection Monday and included just 18 prosecution witnesses. The defense did not present a case. In closing arguments, defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said no evidence had been presented to prove that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was at his house when the victims were killed, and said there was no evidence he had fired the gun that he handed over to authorities when he was arrested. After <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was convicted but before he was sentenced, the defense pleaded with the jury to reject the state's contention that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> killed some of his victims to avoid detection before he killed them all. `` His motive was not to avoid arrest but to satisfy a base, primeval, and vile human passion _ running amok without regard to arrest,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>. The 14 family members killed by <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> included his wife, his seven children, two of the children's spouses and four grandchildren. Among them was a 24-year-old daughter with whom <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> allegedly had an incestuous relationship. Their bodies were found by police on Dec. 28 and Dec. 29, 1987, in and around <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' house 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Autopsy reports said they had been shot or strangled, and had died two to six days before they were found. Authorities went to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> house following his arrest Dec. 28 after he shot six people, two fatally, at four businesses in nearby <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was convicted of murder in those deaths last May and sentenced to death. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> waived his right to appeal in that case and pleaded to be executed as soon as possible. The execution has been delayed, however, because of a legal challenge by an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> minister. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has consented to an appeal of the latest conviction. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> shocked court observers during a routine conference at the judge's bench Friday morning when he suddenly lunged between lawyers and struck <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON>, the prosecutor, in the chin. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> punched again, missed and was subdued by court officers. The tape recording of court stenographer <PERSON> Johna </PERSON> <PERSON> Roedenbeck </PERSON> recorded a voice saying, `` He's trying to get a gun,'' and another voice saying, `` I've got it.'' Jurors watched wide-eyed and some relatives of the slain family members dove for the floor. `` We were scared to death,'' said <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosston </PERSON>, whose daughter and son-in-law died in the murder spree. `` Our legs were like rubber. I'm glad he showed the jury, and I'm glad the jury got to see what he's really like.'' Before the trial resumed, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> he was disappointed in the defendant's behavior and asked, `` Can you give me any assurance you'll behave yourself?'' `` I can, but I do n't have anything to say,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> replied.

<TEXT>
 The last Soviet motorized unit in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> approached the Soviet border as the deadline neared for all the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s troops to leave the war-torn country, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The state radio station said in an English-language broadcast that the unit went through a mountain passage in the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> about 125 miles from the Soviet border. The report did not say how many troops or what kind of equipment were in the unit or when they went through the passage. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the rear guard of Soviet troops had reached <LOCATION> Aibak </LOCATION>, 80 miles from the Soviet border. Wednesday is the deadline for Soviet troop withdrawal set in a U.N.-mediated plan. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> indicated that with the withdrawal of the last motorized unit, troops guarding the route were no longer needed. `` The patrols posted along the highway to ensure the withdrawal of all troops will be called off,'' the broadcast said. It added: `` A small group of Soviet servicemen will remain at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport to guarantee the safe landing of cargo planes from the U.S.S.R.'' The Soviet air force has been flying hundreds of tons of flour, canned meat and other staples into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital, to help feed the poor. A Soviet officer in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Col. <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinokunov </PERSON>, has said the airlift would continue until Monday, when he and his men will leave the defense of the airport to Afghan government forces and return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>, the military chief of staff, has said the last Soviet soldier will leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Tuesday. An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in the country when the Soviet pullout began May 15. Fifty thousand Soviet troops were reported left in the country last August. <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> reported as of Friday that 39,093 Soviets had returned home from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, leaving an estimated 11,000 Red Army troops in the country. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> sent military forces to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help Afghan government forces fight Moslem guerrillas. The guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in April 1978.

 The sailboat Thursday's Child was a day behind schedule in its effort to beat the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-to-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> record set 135 years ago by the clipper Flying Cloud, but its tired crew pressed on. The yacht had been expected to arrive in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Friday, but that prediction was revised after the sloop made miserable progress in a limp, northerly breeze. Thursday's Child was 197 miles south of the Golden Gate on Friday, and could arrive here this afternoon, shoreside spokeswoman <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> said, cautioning `` it could be Sunday.'' The three-man crew was `` very tired'' after being forced into repeated tacks, <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The crew and a host of enthusiasts had hoped the boat would break the previous record by 10 days by arriving Friday. If the 60-foot yacht arrives Sunday, it would be eight days ahead of the clipper ship Flying Cloud's 89-day, eight-hour record for the 14,500-mile passage, set in 1854. Thursday's Child left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Nov. 23. Chief shoreside coordinator <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lush </PERSON> took a philosophical view of the delay. `` Part of being a sailor is taking what the wind gods will allow,'' he said. `` We will take what we can get. `` She is pure sailboat, absolutely at the mercy of the wind,'' <PERSON> Lush </PERSON> added, noting that Thursday's Child has no engine. The delay, however, could make the yacht's entry through the Golden Gate ever more spectacular. A flotilla estimated at 50 to 60 boats was waiting to greet Thursday's Child on Friday, but if it arrived over the weekend there could be hundreds in the gala fleet. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plans to have cutters in the bay to prevent watery chaos. Besides owner <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>, 44, the sloop is crewed by professional skipper <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, 54, who helped design the boat.

 An air force plane today brought to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> the first bodies of Italian tourists killed in the crash of a Caribbean-bound <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charter plane in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>. None of the 144 people believed aboard the ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 survived Wednesday's crash. The 15 coffins were taken off the Hercules C-130 aircraft at <LOCATION> Bergamo </LOCATION> airport, where the jetliner of the <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took off. A second group of about 50 bodies were scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> late today or Sunday, according to <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisegna </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. At <LOCATION> Belgamo </LOCATION> airport, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker stood by as a man knelt down, placed a hand on a carved wooden casket and burst into tears. A priest blessed the coffins, some of which carried name tags with question marks next to the names. Authorities said some victims were only tentatively identified. The charter flight, which carried a crew of seven Americans, was bound for a resort in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. It was about to make a refueling stop in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> island chain in the western <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, when it slammed into a fog-covered mountain. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash. They have said 137 Italians were aboard. Italian media today, however, quoted the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> as saying there appears to have been more passengers on the plane than previously believed. `` On that plane, there was a lot more people than what we knew. How and why will be difficult to understand,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Battistini </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate. State television reported five passports had been found that did not belong to any of the passengers on the flight manifest, raising suspicions perhaps there were some last-minute passengers. The broadcast said another possibility was the passports were of married women who used their maiden name in the document but were listed on the passenger list under their husband's last name.

 The government today banned all protest meetings intended to show solidarity with an estimated 300 black detainees waging a hunger strike to protest being held without charge. The banning order specifically prohibited a protest meeting scheduled this afternoon at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> church by civil rights lawyers who represent many of the hunger strikers. The Detainees Aid Center, a human rights group, said today that two more hunger strikers had been taken to <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, bringing to 13 the number hospitalized this week. It said the two were admitted Friday, but the hospitalization only became known today after their parents visited them. Three others were admitted Friday. About 300 of an estimated 1,000 people detained without charge are participating in the strike, which began Jan. 23 at Diepkloof Prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and has spread to at least three other cities. The Center said another striker, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Modiba </PERSON>, hospitalized Wednesday, was suffering from pre-renal failure, a serious kidney disorder. The banning order, signed by Police Commissioner <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, also outlawed all other gatherings protesting against detentions or expressing support for detainees. `` The banning is the act of frightened little men who fondly hope that the problem will now go away,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, formed by anti-apartheid activists last year. More than 40 <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> lawyers started a 48-hour fast Thursday in solidarity with the detainees. The rally banned today was to mark the end of the fast. Many of the lawyers gathered at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at 1 p.m., the scheduled start of the meeting, to advise would-be participants that it had been banned. Several dozen members of the police riot squad watched from vehicles, and a police video unit filmed lawyers as they spoke with journalists outside the church. `` The fact that the government sees fit to ban this meeting, called by lawyers to discuss problems faced by their clients, goes very far down the road towards the destruction of the rule of law in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Browde </PERSON>, a prominent defense attorney. The strike represents probably the strongest challenge to the policy of detention without trial since President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared a national state of emergency in June 1986. The state-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest and statements the government considers subversive. On Friday, he Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said he and Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> would consider joining the hunger strike. Some of the detainees have been held the entire 32-month state of emergency, during which an estimated 30,000 people have been held without charge for varying lengths of time. `` The emergency regulations have paralyzed the legal system because detainees can not challenge their detention in court,'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said. `` They have had to use this extreme method to draw attention to their plight.'' The government charged the strike was planned by outside groups, and that some detainees had been forced to join it. `` It is clear the strike is being orchestrated from outside,'' Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said in Parliament. `` It is not spontaneous, but carefully planned worldwide by these organizations,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said without referring to any groups by name. `` Most of the detainees taking part do not share the enthusiasm of these organizations.'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said the government chose not to charge the detainees because of the difficulty obtaining convictions. The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s claim of outside instigation was `` not only ludicrous in the extreme but an insult to the commitment and courage of these prisoners of apartheid. `` Support from the outside they certainly do have, no less than the support of the entire world that rejects the evil system of apartheid and its instruments of repression,'' the commission said.

<TEXT>
 A working group of 24 legal experts from the government and opposition that is part of larger negotiations on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future met today to discuss judicial reform. Representatives of the banned trade union Solidarity plan to raise the issue of the need for a more independent judiciary, said historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, opposition chairman of another group trying to work out political reforms. Meanwhile, at least one small strike over wages by transport workers in <LOCATION> Piotrkow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trybunalski </LOCATION>, a central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> provincial city of 80,000 people, continued today, Polish television said. The strike began Friday and is backed by the official trade union OPZZ. The broad-based talks, known as a `` round table,'' began with a plenary session Monday. Working groups met through the week on trade union, economic and political reform. Full negotiations are expected to last four to six weeks.

 A judge set strict conditions for a defendant in the McMartin preschool child molestation case who is about to be freed after five years beyind bars without a conviction. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> delayed the release of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> until some paperwork is completed, but told him Friday that he would have to stay away from defendants in the case and all youngsters under 14. The judge also told <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> that he would be forbidden to return to the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> area where he was reared and where the family-run preschool operated. `` If you fail to return for trial, the trial will take place in your absence,'' the judge warned. He said friends of <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s who posted their property to support the $ 1.5 million bail would lose their real estate if he failed to appear. Attorneys said <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, who had been scheduled for release Friday, probably wo n't be freed until late next week. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, who has objected strenuously to the defendant's release, said she is satisfied with the conditions set by the judge, particularly those barring him from contact with young children. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 30, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, are being tried on 65 molestation and conspiracy counts involving 11 children. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> alone is named in 52 of the charges. He is the only one of seven original defendants who has been held in prison while the case crawled through the courts. The <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case burst into the national media spotlight in 1983 with lurid tales of mass sexual abuse, devilish rituals, death threats and animal mutilations. Hundreds of children were said to be involved. But at the end of an 18-month preliminary hearing, charges were dismissed against five teachers when the district attorney concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them.

 About 500 students demanding the release of political detainees threw rocks at riot police in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> today and tried to march to a government prosecutor's office Police tossed about a dozen tear-gas grenades and dispersed the demonstrators in about 40 minutes. One dissident said at least 27 people were arrested. After a two-hour rally at <ORGANIZATION> Myongdong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, protesters shouting `` release prisoners'' and `` arrest <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>'' clashed with riot police on a narrow shopping street. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> president, has been sharply criticized recently for purported abuses of power during his seven-year adminstration. The demonstrators also demanded that the government `` tell the truth'' about the 1980 uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. The government says 200 students were killed and at least 1,000 injured in the revolt, but critics say the numbers are much higher and have demanded another investigation. Dozens of people were pushed and kicked as lines of students tried unsuccessfully to ram their way past police, who repelled the protesters with tear-gas grenades. Unlike most recent anti-government demonstrations, the protesters did not use firebombs. On Friday, the government proposed legislation that would outlaw the use or manufacture of firebombs.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> scorched some kitchen tiles and told his wife they fell off the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle. That, police say, was just one prop in <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s pose as an astronaut during a period of make-believe that carried him through several states, speaking engagements and marriages. Now his wife is leaving him and he faces fraud and larceny charges for taking his make-believe too far. State police arrested Hunt on Jan. 28 in suburban <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>. The 27-year-old plumber's son from <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> is accused of swindling his fourth wife and bride of five months, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, of up to $ 50,000 on her company-issued credit card without her knowledge and for taking $ 4,000 from a <LOCATION> Saugus </LOCATION> family on the promise he could get their 18-year-old son out of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. On Jan. 6, calling himself Marine Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Hunt, the fake astronaut spoke before a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a very good speaker, he entertained us. He held us spellbound for 2 -LCB- hours,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> chapter president, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, 23, a former optical engineer, also believed he was an astronaut. `` I love the person I thought I was married to,'' she said. Recalling the day he was unmasked, <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said, `` I was shocked. It was almost like watching someone die. He just dissolved, disappeared.'' Hunt is being held on $ 100,000 bail in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> jail. His case in <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was continued to Feb. 15 after a request for reduced bail was denied. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipoletta </PERSON>, could not be reached Friday, but he has said he urged his client not to speak to the news media. Investigators compiling the story of <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s alleged stories say that for the past eight years he has been fooling many people in imaginative ways _ in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Montour </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lighow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> allegedly rode around <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in a limousine seeking models for his baby powder while pretending to be a powder maker. He said Friday that he was investigating charges that <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> swindled his third wife, a local woman, out of large amounts of money. He would not elaborate. Authorities say <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> is believed to have been married to two other women. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doan </PERSON>, the owner of an air service in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was convinced by <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> that he was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter pilot. Last summer, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> chartered a jet to fly with his wife to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, allegedly charging it on his wife's credit card while telling her the flight cost nothing because he was a space shuttle pilot. In <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Oct. 8, he was granted a 10-minute interview with <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>, lord mayor of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>'s spokeswoman said the meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Mansion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the official residence, was arranged after <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON> was told <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was a visiting astronaut. The spokewoman said when <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told the lord mayor that <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was arranging for him to be married at <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON> realized <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was `` not the full shilling,'' but politely said nothing. Others were completely taken in. During Hunt's arrest, police searched the apartment and found assorted military paraphernalia, flight jumpsuits and a helmet bearing the insignia of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, a forensic psychiatrist who is an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> consultant and a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, said there are cases in legal circles falling under the category of the so-called impostor phenomenon. `` It's generally believed that people who are able to dupe others into believing that they have some professional status that's untrue, most likely suffer from antisocial personality disorder,'' said <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, who is on sabbatical in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> He said a recent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> survey found about 5 percent of adult urba men and nearly 1 percent of adult urban women suffer from the disorder. <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> said the ailment can be hereditary and that `` people who -LRB- practice -RRB- such deceptions tend not to have the same depth of emotions, of empathy and warmth, despite their charm.'' Why are so many duped? `` It takes energy, thought, mental work to be skeptical about the myriad claims to legitimacy we come upon every day,'' he said. `` It's easier to take people at their word, particularly when it conveys some status by associating with them.''

 A West German company today denied charges by a U.S.-based Jewish foundation that it provided chemicals for a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> plant that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say is designed to make chemical weapons. `` These allegations are categorically untrue,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimtz </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, accused <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> of supplying chemicals to the plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> of building the factory to make chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has said the plant will manufacture pharmaceuticals. <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> once owned 42.5 percent of the Degesch company, which manufactured the lethal gas used to exterminate Jews interned at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> during World War II, the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is incredible that <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION>, which as a major shareholder in <LOCATION> Degesch </LOCATION>, the company which produced <ORGANIZATION> Zyklon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION>, should once again contribute to a genocidal mission,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Landes </PERSON> of the center on Friday. `` We urge the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government not to release these chemicals or any chemicals to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> which in any way can be turned into an agent for a new Final Solution.'' He was referring to the Nazi policy of killing Jews. <PERSON> Nimtz </PERSON> said the company had delivered chemicals to a fertilizer factory in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> since 1983, but that it was more than 600 miles away from the disputed chemical plant. Referring to the wartime connection with <PERSON> Degesch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nimtz </PERSON> said: `` Not one <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> official was ever convicted of war crimes. The Degesch officials were executed.'' Customs officials on Feb. 3 temporarily halted a <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> chemical shipment to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to determine whether export licenses were required. <PERSON> Nimtz </PERSON> said at the time that the chemical, hexamethylene tetramine, could not be used to produce poison gas and did not require an export permit. He said today he expected the chemical to be released for shipment by next week. `` We have always delivered this chemical straight to -LRB- the Libyan city of -RRB- <PERSON> Bengazi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nimtz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` In the form we deliver it, it can only be used to make fertilizer.'' Another company official, who asked not to be identified, said <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> delivers the same chemical to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We have nothing to do with <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> and we are not the target of any criminal investigations in connection with it,'' <PERSON> Nimtz </PERSON> said.

 A luxury liner that sliced a Cuban freighter in two, leaving three crewmen missing and 13 injured, returned to its home port today while officials asked why the smaller vessel did n't show up on the liner's radar. The cruise ship Celebration's crew said there was no way to avoid slamming into the cargo ship, which was drifting without lights off the Cuban coast before dawn Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. `` It was not seen on radar. That's a mystery at this point,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Navigation lights on the Cuban freighter Capitan <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> went on only when the two ships were very close, he said. The 734-foot Celebration's officers tried to reverse course, but it was too late for the 350-foot cement hauler, according to <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. The Miami-based cruise ship suffered minor damage and none of its 1,500 passengers and 600 crew members was injured, he said. A large black scrape was visible on the port side from the water line to the tip of the bow when the Celebration approached its dock at the Port of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today, but <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said it looked worse than it was. Accident investigations were planned by the cruise line and its insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has conducted a series of hearings in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on cruise line safety. A team from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s marine safety office also planned to inspect the cruise ship, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> was confident the ship would clear that inspection and sail again as scheduled at 4 p.m. on another weeklong cruise. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials said they also wanted to look into the incident even though it involved a Liberian-registered cruise liner and a Cuban freighter en route from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have jurisdiction, but we are expecting that <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> will grant us permission to go aboard when the ship arrives,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We want to look at the ship and talk in particular to the crew on the bridge at the time.'' Two lifeboat crews from the Celebration rescued 42 of the 45 Cuban crew members, including one whose foot was severed, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. A Cuban navy frigate and tug picked up the rescued crew members, who were being treated at <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comandante </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pedro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sotto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The three missing men were apparently in a cabin at the stern of the 350-foot freighter, which sank immediately, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. The bow section sank hours later. The three missing crewmen included the ship's Capt. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazco </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, 34, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> los </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyre </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 40, all of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> reported. `` Basically, we've relinquished our search and rescue responsibilities to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman indicated today that party leaders have rejected a Politburo reformer's reassessment of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising Spokesman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> told Hungarian radio that speakers at a crucial Friday session of the 108-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said there should be no `` single-word summary formulations'' to reassess the past. Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> startled the nation Jan. 28 by saying the 1956 rebellion against Soviet control was `` a popular uprising.'' Officially, it was called a counterrevolution. The meeting resumed today with the media reporting few specifics. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said his assessment was based on findings of a <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> commission investigating four decades of communist rule in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Prominent Central Committee member <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, also state secretary at the foreign ministry, hinted late Friday that <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s stance was not accepted by most members Varying only slightly from the official stance, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said on television that the meeting's `` very careful assessment'' showed the revolt `` started as an uprising, some may call it a ` popular uprising,' but later on it turned into something which could be termed a counterrevolution.'' State media displayed none of their new openness in reporting on Friday's closed-door session. It was not known what was said by <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and other senior officials. <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> told a Hungarian radio reporter that almost half the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members will have spoken by the time the session ends, probably late this evening. According to <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON>, the speakers supported the basic idea expounded in a report submitted by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, which says `` one can establish order without a reform, but the reform may not be instituted without order.'' He also said <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> called for an action program for the future. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>' speech has not been published and no other details were disclosed. The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with demonstrations for a new government and demands that Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. About 20,000 Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to quell the uprising on Nov. 4, and <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was elevated to power. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> replaced him last year. Before the session, communist leaders appeared split not only over the 1956 events but also over the pace and extent of reforms. They were also disagreeing over introduction of a multiparty system demanded by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s mushrooming independent political groups. Both <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and other top party men went on record as disagreeing with <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s challenge to the official view of a counterrevolution crushed by Soviet tanks. His statement opened up public differences with other party leaders and an unprecedented debate in the state press and society about the events. The bloody end of the rebellion is a highly emotional issue for Hungarians, and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is under pressure to revise its view. Alternative political movements that have sprung up in recent months say they will not enter a coalition with the communists, as some party reformers want, if the party does not change its stand on 1956.

 Doctors today completed an abortion on a comatose woman whose husband had battled anti-abortion activists to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to become her guardian. `` It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go on with my life,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said after the abortion was performed on his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, 32. `` No other family should ever have to go through what we have gone through.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who was 18 weeks pregnant, has been at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> since a Dec. 13 car accident left her comatose. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> at 9:40 a.m. announced that the abortion had been completed. `` We are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the operation went smoothly,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s mother. `` Now we are hopeful that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s condition will improve and that we can move on to therapy for her.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> later thanked people who had supported his efforts. About a half-dozen pro-choice activists carried placards outside the hospital this morning. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION>, sought guardianship of his brain-damaged wife on Jan. 26 so he could authorize the abortion that doctors said might save her life. A judge granted his request. But the activists blocked the abortion at each court level until <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> on Friday turned down their request for a stay of the lower court ruling declaring <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> his wife's guardian. `` Tough battle but we won it,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said Friday by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We can now turn our attention to trying to help <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION> anti-abortion activist who had helped block <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s guardianship, also had asked conservative <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> to intervene because `` they are criminally assaulting her and killing her child.'' Around 6 p.m. Friday, doctors gave Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> medication that is routinely administered about 12 hours before a second-trimester abortion is performed, Ms. <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> said. She said it was unclear what effect the abortion would have on Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. `` In her condition, puncturing a pimple is dangerous,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> said. `` She's in guarded condition and the status of her life neurologically is very precarious. It's terrible _ really, really tragic.'' Outside the hospital Friday, a lone anti-abortion protester carrying baby clothing and clutching a rosary and cross was arrested for trespass after he lay down in front of the front door, Ms. <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> and police said. He refused to give his name to authorities. On Thursday, Appellate Division judges said that previous <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court decisions had established that strangers will not be appointed legal guardians unless no one in the family can serve in that role. `` <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was fully capable of handling his wife's affairs,'' the lower state appeals court said. The next day, the seven judges of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, the state's highest court, declined to review the original decision by Judge <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> that named <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> guardian of his pregnant wife. The anti-abortion activists, Short and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, were rebuffed again when <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who has jurisdiction over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, turned down their request for a stay without comment. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said they would attempt to continue the case so questions raised by the case can be resolved. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON>, expressed relief, but said the case's tragic circumstances made the legal victory bittersweet. `` Life will never be the same,'' <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> said. `` This has been such a horrendous ordeal. I hope no one will ever have to experience what we have. `` We're really torn apart. We've been up and down on a roller coaster. These people -LRB- Short and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> -RRB- have put us through absolute hell,'' he added. <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, live in <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, but have been staying with their 34-year-old son-in-law during the court battle and support his decision to seek an abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> Kleins </ORGANIZATION> have a 3-year-old child. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said that after learning at the hospital of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s decision, `` I told <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> that everything was going to be fine I gave her a kiss and came home.''

 An Afghan guerrilla spokesman said today that a meeting to form a post-war Islamic government for his homeland will reconvene, but others said deep divisions threaten the process. The 526 delegates who gathered Friday to attend the meeting included guerrillas, scholars and ministers from previous Afghan governments. But the meeting was adjourned indefinitely after Iranian-based guerrillas walked out in a dispute over representation at the meeting and on a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of guerrilla leaders. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would make many day-to-day decisions in the post-war Afghan government. <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON>, spokesman for the gathering, told a news conference in the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> capital that the meeting would resume but that he could not say when. <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON> played down divisions in the quarrelsome alliance of seven Pakistani-based insurgent groups. But guerrilla sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the factions were deeply divided over the composition of a post-war government and the role the eight Iranian-based insurgent groups would play. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> alliance, offered the Iranian-based groups 100 delegates to the meeting and six seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He was overruled by the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> alliance's four extremist parties, said <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waziri </PERSON>, political officer of <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>'s moderate <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON> said the last offer to the Iranian alliance was 102 delegates to the meeting, of which 42 would be chosen by the Pakistani alliance. There was no offer of seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The Iranian alliance also rejected that offer. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, chairman of the Iranian alliance, said earlier today his delegation was returning to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> belong to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s minority Shiite sect of Islam. The Pakistani-based insurgents are Sunni Moslems and so are about 80 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 15 million people. Officials of moderate guerrilla groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said they feared hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> radicals would try to dominate a post-war government. `` We do n't want an extremist-dominated government to be there,'' said <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>, spokesman for the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. One thing the guerrilla groups agree on is that the communist government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will fall after the Soviets complete their troop withdrawal, expected by Wednesday under an accord mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviets sent troops to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to prop up the Marxist government. About 115,000 soldiers were stationed there when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began its pullout in May.

 Two of 17 jailed terrorists whose release is the key demand of kidnappers holding American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have been released after serving five-year prison terms, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s interior minister said today <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said the two men _ <PERSON> Abdul-Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashash </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, 25, an Iraqi national; and 30-year-old <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Matar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahash </PERSON>, whose family lives in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> without official citizenship _ were released `` a while ago, having completed their prison terms.'' The pro-Iranian terrorists were convicted of a spate of bombings in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in December 1983, including the Dec. 12 attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy that involved driving a bomb-laden truck into the compound. Other targets hit in the attacks were the French embassy and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> airport control tower, an industrial center, the Electricity and <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s control center, and offices and residences of Americans. The Arab government reported five people killed, including the truck driver, and 86 wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> listed seven killed, including the truck driver. Speaking to reporters today, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said the release `` has nothing to do with the demands of extremist organizations.'' The 17 terrorists sent to <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jails included three sentenced to death by hanging, seven to life imprisonment, four to 15 years in jail, one to 10 years and the two to five years. Three others, Iraqi Shiites, were tried and sentenced to death in their absence. They all were sentenced March 27, 1984, by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s state security court. The terrorists include Kuwaitis, Iraqis and Lebanese, most belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, which is the dominant sect in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, had demanded the release of the 17 convicts in return for two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages it has been holding since 1985. Those captives are <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. Islamic Jihad also claims to be holding hospital administrator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, kidnapped on March 16, 1985, is the longest-held of 15 Westerners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> was kidnapped June 9, 1985. Captors of the other hostages _ including seven other Americans _ have not publicly demanded the release of the Kuwaiti prisoners.

 Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> arrived Saturday for her first official trip abroad and gave assurances that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, long a close ally of her country, will remain a cornerstone of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign policy. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, speaking at a banquet put on by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, said her visit had special significance in that she was fulfilling a promise made after her election in November to make <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> her first foreign stop. `` This demonstrates that the democratic government attaches special importance and priority to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s time-tested relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> received a boisterous welcome from about 200 Pakistani diplomats, residents and schoolchildren at the airport. She broke with normal procedure, walking away from a waiting limousine to shake hands with the Pakistanis. Many shouted her name and waved banners in English, Arabic and Chinese reading `` Long Live <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'' and `` Long Live Sino-Pakistan Friendship.'' The Pakistani leader will spend three days in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, she plans to meet with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and the general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will be the main focus of talks, but another topic is expected to be <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> reported Saturday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had reached agreement with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to purchase 75 F-7 jets, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> version of the MiG-21, at a cost of about $ 225 million. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is second only to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in providing military equipment to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and is now helping <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> develop its nuclear industry. Both <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have denied persistent reports the nuclear aid has military applications. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in her banquet remarks, recalled how her father, the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, made his first foreign trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1972. She said her father had sent all four of his children to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for a month in 1972, when she was a student in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on his 1976 state visit. Her speech also gave a rundown of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign policy, which generally has knitted closely with that of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was glad to see prospects of improved relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> following Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in December, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said. She said her recent talks with the Indian leader also `` helped to remove some of the mistrust that has bedeviled the <LOCATION> Pak-India </LOCATION> relationship.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also praised the warming of relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to culminate with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May. It will be the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. `` We believe that the reduction of tension and resolution of outstanding issues between the two great neighbors will be conducive to peace and stability in our region,'' she said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with common adversaries in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, have been very close since <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> became one of the first countries to recognize the Communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after it was established in 1949. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had close relations with Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, under whose rule Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father was arrested and executed in 1979. But <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was quick to support Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> after she was elected to succeed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who died in a suspicious plane crash in August. Before the banquet, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was officially greeted by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> at a welcoming ceremony inside the Great Hall of the People. On Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is to hold talks with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and meet party leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. She is also to meet <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Yingchao </PERSON>, the widow of Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>, her host during her 1972 visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She departs Sunday evening for <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where she is to meet President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. She will meet <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> there Monday.

 A restaurant that was moved from the Eiffel Tower in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has become the latest casualty of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s depressed economy. `` We're just not doing enough business now,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P.L </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bonnot </PERSON>, the restaurant's developer and chef. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is a French city with a French history.

In 1981, Le Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel was removed from its perch on the Eiffel Tower, 562 feet above the ground, when engineers noticed the tower was beginning to sag under its weight. It opened in 1986 after more than two dozen partners put up about $ 3.3 million. Last April, the partners filed for Chapter 13 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors so they could attempt to reorganize.

The reports in The Los Angeles Times and the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> raised new questions about Tower's ties to defense contractors, one of several areas that have held up confirmation of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice as secretary of defense The publications said Tower has said he advised the British firm on selling military systems to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> even though he testified to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that his work for British Aerospace concerned only non-military matters. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> apparently has not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower. The Post, citing syndicated columnist <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>, said the incidents included an episode on June 6, 1967 when Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> by an early-morning blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair. When firemen broke into his room to remove him, `` he was reportedly in no condition to free himself,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. In written testimony, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he could `` recall no actions in connection with any defense activities'' that he had done for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of British Aerospace. Tower told the committee, which has suspended consideration of his nomination until after the current congressional recess, that he worked chiefly on selling commercial jets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and also advised <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> on trade legislation and currency fluctuations. But in a sworn deposition in June 1987, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he had given the company advice on `` selling certain systems to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The statement was given in a deposition to lawyers representing Tower's second wife in their divorce proceeding, the publications reported. Tower said in the deposition that he advised the company on how to sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Legal Times reported that Tower earned $ 265,000 from British Aerospace June 1986 until last December. White House spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said today when asked about the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reports: `` We have no information on that. It's -LRB- the issue of Tower's nomination -RRB- before the committee. We wo n't comment on that.'' The reports came as the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moved Friday to refute allegations concerning Tower's use of alcohol. The doctor who performed surgery on Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> last month released a statement saying he found no medical evidence that the nominee abuses alcohol. Dr. R.D. <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON>, a colo-rectal surgeon at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Tower underwent an extensive medical evaluation, including a complete blood chemistry analysis and an abdominal CAT scan, prior to his Jan. 5 operation to remove a polyp in his colon. `` All tests and examinations that Senator Tower underwent indicated no abnormalities within organ systems that might be involved with alcohol abuse,'' Dr. <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` From a medical standpoint we do n't have any evidence that Senator Tower abuses alcohol.'' After the surgery, <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> discussed with Tower his postoperative recuperation and diet. `` I advised the senator that his normal limit of one or two glasses of wine with dinner was medically acceptable,'' <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he still has `` continuing questions overall'' about the Tower nomination, including questions about Tower's alcohol use The 63-year-old former senator says he drinks only modestly, usually a little wine. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the committee has received medical information from Tower's doctors but the panel has `` done nothing with that except read it.'' `` We made no decision about what to do with it,'' he said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and the ranking Republican on the committee, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, also said Friday that final action on the nomination is likely when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns Feb. 21 from its weeklong recess. The action, however, depends on the results of the ongoing <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` We're not saying any kind of deadline but it is certainly my hope that the week we get back the committee will take a final action on this nomination,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said after he and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> met with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he was unaware of any new allegations against Tower and he dismissed suggestions of security breaches by the nominee while he served as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms-control negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` We've found nothing on that,'' he said. Senators have said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is checking any links between Tower and defense contractors named in `` Operation Ill Wind,'' the code-name for the federal investigation of alleged corruption in the Pentagon's procurement system. Records on file at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> show that Tower received campaign contributions for his 1984 election race from at least two men who have been named in federal affidavits released in the Ill Wind case. Tower, who opted not to run in 1984, received a $ 500 campaign contribution from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employee. He also received $ 1,000 from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, a Washington-based consultant. Neither has been charged in the Pentagon case. Both donations were within the $ 1,000 limit for individual contributions. Tower also received a legal contribution of $ 500 from the <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> political action committee as did <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> when he ran for re-election in 1984. Under federal election law, the <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> could have given up to $ 10,000 to any candidate for the primary and general election. <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> merged with the <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to become <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that Tower, in his meeting with <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unaware of the campaign contributions and denied allegations that he had a drinking problem Meanwhile, The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> has removed himself from any involvement in the Tower probe. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> refused to say why Sessions, a former federal judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had recused himself.

 The first underground nuclear weapons test of 1989 was strong enough to shake some highrise buildings in the gambling city of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, 80 miles away. Friday's test, code-named <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, had been scheduled for Thursday but was delayed by snow. It was delayed four hours Friday by low cloud cover at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, a 1,350-square mile expanse of desert northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The weapon, buried 1,650 feet beneath the surface of Yucca Flat, had an explosive yield equivalent to between 20 and 150 kilotons ot <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, who was at the control center 7.5 miles from ground zero. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a telephone operator at the Regency Towers highrise apartments in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, said chandeliers tinkled shortly after the blast, but she said it was n't as strong as some previous shots. `` Some of them have been pretty noticeable,'' she said. `` There were no calls -LRB- from residents -RRB- but we're getting so used to them, we do n't get calls like we used to.'' The explosion registered 5.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said spokesman Waverly Person.

 A judge threw out hundreds of traffic tickets because a prosecutor was a few minutes late, and says he thinks he's made his point. `` Everyone is supposed to be there by 9 a.m. and that applies to the prosecutor as well,'' <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> also issued a bench warrant accusing City Prosecutor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of contempt, but dismissed it after conferring with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and deciding no deliberate contempt of court was involved. The judge acknowledged that Assistant City Prosecutor <PERSON> Sybil </PERSON> <PERSON> LeDuff </PERSON> did walk into court about 9:02 or 9:03 a.m. Friday, and said there has not been any problem with habitual tardiness on the part of prosecutors. But he said he has warned members of the prosecutor's office that he'd dismiss traffic cases on his docket if prosecutors were late. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the judge never told him personally. <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said his chief deputy clerk and bailiff both went out in the hall at 9 a.m. but could n't find anyone from the prosecutor's office <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> LeDuff </PERSON>, recently hired, was indeed in the hall, taking tickets from people who had appeared and sorting through cases to see which would go to trial.

 A jet fighter of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> crashed in a rice paddy in communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today after it ran out of oil, but the pilot parachuted to safety, official reports said. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, a relative of the pilot said he believed the officer had defected to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to see his grandmother in the southeastern province of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>. But an official at the <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> office of the state-run radio said government officials did not believe the pilot, identified as <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xianshun </PERSON>, 35, had defected. `` We believe he lost his way in the fog,'' said the official, who would only identify himself as <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. `` He now is in the hospital in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> with minor injuries.'' The radio official said provincial officials will meet Sunday to discuss <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>'s repatriation if he is not a defector. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said the F-5E jet fighter lost contact with a radio tower at <LOCATION> Chihang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 180 miles southest of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, about 10 minutes after taking off on a training flight. The <ORGANIZATION> Canton </ORGANIZATION> radio official said the plane crashed in a rice paddy in <LOCATION> Fengshun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> about 180 miles north of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province. He said it was not clear whether there were any casualties on the ground. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the plane was mangled in the crash. A relative of <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity from <LOCATION> Miaoli </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, said he believed the pilot had defected because <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> had complained about the ban on military personnel visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In 1987, the Nationalist government in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> eased the ban to allow all Taiwanese, except military personnel and government employees, to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. More than a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officers have sought asylum in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1949, when the Nationalists fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after losing a civil war with communist forces on the mainland. The latest was <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawei </PERSON>, who defected in 1983 in a trainer plane. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> received $ 40,000 from the Chinese government and use of a chauffered limousine. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> late last year abolished the system of rewards for Taiwanese military defectors. Military officials in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said 19 military personnel have defected from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since 1949. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> regards <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as a renegade province and the two are technically at war.

 Say what you will it about the savings and loan crisis, it has done wonders for the ampersand. Vaguely old fashioned, the ampersand _ that curly little symbol that stands for `` and'' _ seemed to be in a decline until the financial difficulties of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry put it on every front page. For some reason, S & amp; Ls are always abbreviated with an ampersand, just as superbowls are numbered with Roman numerals. Like everything else, the ampersand has a history. According to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, who wrote the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins, it was invented by <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiro </PERSON>, a freed slave and secretary to <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>, a Roman statesman, orator and author. <PERSON> Tiro </PERSON>'s job was taking down <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>'s dictation. <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> talked fast, so Tiro created the first known system of shorthand, including the ampersand. Tiro's `` Tironian Notes'' saw wide use in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for nearly a thousand years. The & amp; itself was just a quick way of writing `` et,'' which means `` and'' in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION>. The name `` ampersand'' is a corruption of the term `` and per se and,'' which means `` as follows.'' The Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and abandon their ampersands. The <ORGANIZATION> Morrises </ORGANIZATION> note that the ad firm of <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Barton </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Durstin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> switched to simply <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Durstin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, dropping the ampersand and losing `` part of the charm which led <PERSON> Heywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Broun </PERSON> to say that the corporate name sounded to him like ` a beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps.''' In any event, the <ORGANIZATION> Morrises </ORGANIZATION>, getting down to business, decree that the ampersand is to be avoided `` in writing of formal or semiformal nature, save for the most impromptu personal notes.'' However, the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback, even without the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis' spur of conspicuousness, says <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragdon </PERSON>, senior vice president in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> firm which does `` name development'' for companies changing their images. He said after stiff debate during a yearlong `` identity program'' for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, it was decided to abandon the `` and'' in `` PG and E,'' its old symbol, in favor of `` <ORGANIZATION> PG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E.'' `` We had to resolve once and for all how to represent ` and,''' <PERSON> Bragdon </PERSON> said. `` There were a whole variety of constituencies. Lots of people wanted ` and' and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very discrete plus sign would be modern and hip. We advocated the ampersand as an inalienable part of the name _ a beautiful, stylized ampersand.'' However, to show how short-lived these victories are, <PERSON> Bragdon </PERSON> said his own firm has changed its name, abandoning an ampersand in the process. It used to be S & amp; O Consultants. The final decision was to go with <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION>, over the objections of founder and chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohrenschalls </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> today told a huge outdoor rally celebrating the 10-year revolution that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders are disagreeing but remain committed to their `` revolutionary ideas.'' `` This is natural all over the world, but there are no disagreements over the basic policy and objectives of the revolution,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said in an address to a crowded square from a platform draped in blue and green. `` Our revolutionary ideas have not changed.'' Hard-liners and moderates in the regime are battling over how far <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should develop relations with the outside world after years of self-imposed isolation. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is willing to cooperate with any country to help rebuild the economy battered in an eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, as long as the country giving the aid `` does n't try to dominate us.'' According to police, between 3 million and 4 million people attended the rally, climaxing 10 days of celebrations for the 10th anniversary of the overthrow of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> and founding of an Islamic state by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. A 10-story high portrait of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> suspended from a crane overlooked the square, but the 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch, now in frail health, was not present. He rarely leaves his <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> residence. Three choirs of children, wearing headbands saying `` happy and blessed is the next decade,'' sang the national anthem. A squadron of military helicopters dropped leaflets calling for unity in the the postwar reconstruction. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported the crowd included 230 political prisoners freed today under a general amnesty. It said most were released from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s Evin Jail, where they were being held under sentence of death or life imprisonment. The agency did not say for what offenses the prisoners were jailed. Security at the rally was tight, with guards armed with automatic weapons patrolling and searching foreign reporters. `` After coming through hardships and battles today we feel much stronger,'' said <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, despite what he called `` plotting by world oppressor powers'' _ a reference to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants friendly ties with all countries, except the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The crowd listened quietly but shouted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' in English and waved clenched fists when official cheerleader <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazadi </PERSON> led chanting in a booming baritone. As snow started falling at the end of the rally, <LOCATION> Montazadi </LOCATION>, known to Iranians as `` minister of slogans,'' started a new chant of `` Islam is best.'' Many attending traveled through the night for final events of the celebrations. `` This is a big day for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and we want to show the Imam -LRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> -RRB- our love and support for the revolution,'' explained <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Isfahani </PERSON>, a white-bearded man who said he lost two sons in the Iran-Iraq war. `` No sacrifice is enough in serving God,'' he said. Officials said similar rallies were being held across the country to commemorate the overthrow of the 2,500-year-old monarchy. The celebrations take place amid increased public debate and criticism of the clergy-dominated government. `` Unfortunately, instead of safeguarding the values of the revolution, we shouted slogans. Instead of keeping the people involved, we isolated the intelligent and active forces, making them more and more disgruntled,'' <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s designated successor, said in an interview this week with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION>. This year's colorful celebrations _ marked by fireworks and floodlit buildings _ contrast sharply with previous years during the grueling war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20 in the war, which took the lives of 1 million Iranians and Iraqis.

 Afghan Shiite Moslem guerrillas supported by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are demanding a major voice in the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, despite opposition from more powerful, rival Sunni guerrilla groups. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> government wants to use the Afghan Shiites to exert influence in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and try to block the influence of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, according to Afghan analysts. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants to play the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> card in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said a senior independent guerrilla official, who declined to be named. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have backed the Pakistan-based Sunni groups who have been battling the Afghan government nearly a decade. <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla leaders pulled out Friday from a meeting of Afghan guerrilla leaders in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, which was held to try to form an interim government to replace <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s tottering communist regime. Sunni Afghan guerrilla groups refused to recognize an earlier agreement to seat 100 <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> representatives at the council because they wanted to reduce the number of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> delegates. Eight Shiite Afghan guerrilla organizations are based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but little is known about them. The groups are armed, supplied and trained by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and appear to be under Iranian control. Seven Sunni Afghan guerrilla groups are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with headquarters in the frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. But the much larger Sunni groups are not based primarily on religious loyalties. Occasional reports of friction and clashes between Sunni and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have come out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Iranian Revolutionary Guards reportedly have operated at times in Shiite areas of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, aiding the Iranian-based guerrillas against conservative Shiites who oppose <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary fundamentalism. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, chairman of the alliance of the Iranian based groups, said the groups are not primarily promoted by Shiite loyalties despite their religious base. The Shiite groups, he said, are only seeking equal rights for all religious and ethnic groups and an end to discrimination they suffered in the past. `` We want an Islamic government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, it must be independent and it must be non-aligned,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Shiites were discriminated against by past Sunni-dominated Afghan governments before the Communists seized power in 1978. Shiites were banned from the armed forces, most government posts and had limited educational and career opportunities, according to Afghan exiles. <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> said about 30 percent of Afghans are Shiites, but most estimates put the number of Shiites at about 15 percent, with Sunnis making up about 80 percent of the population. Shiite guerrilla groups have played a comparatively small role in the decade-long war against the Afghan Communist government and Soviet forces that supported the regime, according to most Afghan analysts. There are no reliable figures on the fighting strength of the various Sunni and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla groups. Estimates indicate Sunni fighters outnumber <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas 10-to-1. <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> said he could not provide any figures on the number of fighters the Shiites can field but said their forces had occupied large areas of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Some of the Pakistani-based Sunni guerrilla groups operate from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but their leaders complain that the Iranians obstruct operations and limit or delay supplies. Other Sunni groups pulled out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or refused to operate there because of frequent problems. <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> denied charges the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups are influenced by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, saying they had simply received aid from the Iranians. `` We are from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, we are <PERSON> Afghani </PERSON>, we will never accept interference in our affairs from any country,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has little chance of exporting its revolutionary brand of fundamentalism to conservative, Sunni-dominated <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> <PERSON> Majrooh </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors events in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But the Sunni guerrilla groups are deeply divided over sharing power, political aims and other issues and their alliance has been able to agree on very little. Even a relatively small force such as the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas could promote Iranian interests in the confusion likely to follow the expected fall of the communist regime, some analysts say. `` In a divided <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a trained and well armed force loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could be very useful to the Iranians,'' <PERSON> Majrooh </PERSON> said.

 Two money bags containing $ 365,000 fell out of an armored truck, so <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Olio </PERSON> did what came naturally _ they picked them up and took them to police. `` We did what we felt we should do,'' said Olio, 78. `` My husband's just too honest,'' said his 65-year-old wife. The Olios will receive a reward for their honesty, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said from his <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, office. `` We are very grateful to that couple,'' he said. The Olios were driving down Main Street when the bags fell out of the truck Friday. `` The driver sped up just past the Prospect Street traffic light and he must have hit a bump because a door flew open and the bags fell out,'' <PERSON> Olio </PERSON> said. The armored truck kept going but <PERSON> Olio </PERSON> turned around and retrieved the bags. `` They were pretty heavy, probably weighed 40 or 50 pounds between'em,'' said the retired mailman, who took the bags to the police department. `` Something like that does n't happen very often around here.

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> today accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of massing troops along the border to invade and later annex <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said his government had received information that Pakistani forces were preparing to attack the southern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Jallabad </LOCATION>.

 Human rights activists Saturday threatened defiance and warned of rising black anger after police banned meetings intended to support a hunger strike by 300 blacks detained without charge. Some of the strikers have gone 20 days without food, and lawyers say 13 have been hospitalized. A support committee said many were in danger of dying or suffering irreparable physical damage. The ban specifically prohibited a protest meeting scheduled Saturday at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> church by civil rights lawyers who represent strikers. The order, signed by Police Commissioner <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, also outlawed all other gatherings protesting detentions or expressing support for detainees. `` The banning is the act of frightened little men who fondly hope that the problem will now go away,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, formed by anti-apartheid activists last year. The Hunger Strikers Support Committee, a coalition established last week, said the ban `` will not prevent public expressions of solidarity with detainees. The issue is far too serious.'' `` The government's intransigence will only exacerbate the already widespread feelings of anger and alienation in the black community,'' the committee said. More than 40 <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> lawyers started a 48-hour fast Thursday in solidarity with the detainees. They had planned to end the fast at Saturday's meeting. Many of the lawyers gathered at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at 1 p.m., the scheduled start of the meeting, to advise would-be participants it had been banned. Several dozen riot police watched from vehicles, and a police video unit filmed lawyers as they spoke with journalists outside the church. `` The fact that the government sees fit to ban this meeting, called by lawyers to discuss problems faced by their clients, goes very far down the road toward the destruction of the rule of law in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Browde </PERSON>, a prominent defense attorney. About 300 of an estimated 1,000 people detained without charge have joined the strike, which began Jan. 23 at Diepkloof Prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and spread to at least three other cities. The strike is widely viewed as the most serious challenge to the policy of indefinite detention without trial since the government declared a national state of emergency in June 1986. Some detainees have been held for the entire emergency, during which an estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying periods. The government says it has not charged the detainees because of the difficulty obtaining convictions. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> alleged Friday the strike was planned by outside groups and that some detainees had been forced to join it. The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s allegation was `` not only ludicrous in the extreme but an insult to the commitment and courage of these prisoners of apartheid.'' Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools, districts and health services.

 The family of a woman who gave birth while in a coma expressed support for anti-abortion activists fighting a losing battle against a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man's effort to have the operation performed on his comatose wife. `` We should take whatever <PERSON> God </PERSON> has given us and that's the way it is,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, whose daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, was three months pregnant when she suffered a brain injury in an auto accident last June. The 24-year-old woman gave birth to a healthy boy, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, on Dec. 9. Despite a gloomy prognosis, she began to regain consciousness shortly after the birth and can now sit up in a wheelchair and hold a bottle to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s lips. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> said he spoke Friday with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, one of two anti-abortion activists who challenged the request by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> that he be appointed guardian of his comatose wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's highest court on Friday refused to let <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> intervene in the case. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> subsequently rejected their request for a stay of state court rulings granting <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> guardianship, and doctors performed the abortion today. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who was 18 weeks pregnant, has been in a coma at a hospital in <LOCATION> Manhasset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, since an auto accident Dec. 13, and has been given only a slight chance of recovering. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said physicians advised him an abortion may save her life. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> said he called Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s mother Thursday to offer information. `` I told her what transpired with <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I do n't think taking the baby is going to be any benefit to the mother.'' <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, who opposes abortion, said he was not able to talk with <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. Members of Mrs. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>'s family point to her recovery as proof that doctors can be wrong in such cases. `` They -LRB- doctors -RRB- were at one time telling us the same kind of thing,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>'s father. `` All we asked them to do is make the attempt to maintain both as best they could. Once they decided to do it, it did n't seem like a major problem.'' <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> said his daughter-in-law's life was also threatened by elevated body temperatures caused by the brain injury, and that the antibiotics used to treat the fever were a threat to the fetus. But there was never any serious consideration of trying to save one over the other, he said.

 Two days after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted by an 8-1 margin to bury a 51 percent congressional pay raise last week, Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked if he would consider a smaller increase. `` That question has been answered,'' he told reporters, referring to the rejection vote. `` I can count.'' `` Everyone wants to change the subject and move on,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who was a supporter of the raise `` It -LRB- the pay raise battle -RRB- left deep scars that wo n't be quickly healing. There's a mutual frustration with each other. Such comments are not surprising in the aftermath of the 380-48 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote, and the 94-6 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tally, to reject a raise that brought howls of protest on talk shows across the nation. As tired as lawmakers may be of the painful affair, however, at least some issues linked to it wo n't go away. Common Cause, the self-styled citizen's lobby, says it will maintain pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate the outside income lawmakers receive from special interest groups. `` This Congress can not long ignore the increasing call for ethical reform,'' said <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted two weeks ago to bar members from pocketing fees for speaking to various groups, including special interest lobbies. But it made the change contingent on approval of the pay raise. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had been planning to vote on the honoraria issue last Thursday, coupled with a plan by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to scale the raise back to 30 percent. The issue went on the back burner Tuesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> decided the public would n't stand for any raise. `` It's a major setback for reform,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., `` I thought what was needed was to increase salary, do away with honoraria and start a reform movement here. While House members are still eligible to keep $ 26,850 in honoraria, the question of outside fees has been bucked to a new bipartisan panel co-chaired by <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill. Lawmakers say there's no chance the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ where members can retain $ 35,800 in honoraria _ will give up the system without a raise, since that would amount to a pay cut. Still simmering is the issue of raises for judges and top federal executives. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' rejection of its own increase prevented raises for: 1,100 judges; 834 top executive branch appointed officials; 7,000 career federal managers, 12,000 foreign service officers and 155 generals and admirals. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> told colleagues just before the rejection, `` We are voting to continue the exodus of judges, top-level managers, and yes, creative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from government service to the private sector.'' Lawmakers have shown little interest in resurrecting these pay raises without considering their own. `` I do n't think it's a sound idea, because of the branches being equal,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> civil service subcommittee `` The forefathers did n't say we should have a lower branch.'' A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courts </ORGANIZATION> concluded 20 of the last 26 judges to leave the federal bench said pay was a factor in their resignations. From 1958-73, six federal judges resigned from the lifetime position, compared to 60 from 1974 to 1978. The loss in real salary due to inflation has totaled 30 percent for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judges since 1969, the office said. Here are other unresolved issues from the pay raise dispute, which the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics panel may consider: _ Expenses Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> invited to make a speech can wind up with a stay in a posh resort, courtesy of special interests. The panel must decide whether to follow the lead of bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, whose ill-fated honoraria reform package would likely have placed time limits on trips for a single speech. _ Non-honoraria income The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal would have: limited all outside income to 15 percent of salary; prohibited affiliation with business entities for compensation; prevented members from practicing a profession, except part-time teaching; and banned members from serving as an officer or board member on a publicly held regulated corporation. The prohibitions on business and professional affiliations are already in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules. A separate Wright-appointed panel on campaign finance reform will consider whether to eliminate the `` grandfather clause'' loophole in federal law. The provision allows <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, in office before 1980, to convert leftover campaign cash to personal use. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reform package would have ended this loophole in 1991, allowing any member holding leftover cash to retire with the money after this term. But anyone running again would have limited options, including giving to campaigns of others, donating the money to charity, or returning it to those who made the contributions.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an Episcopal priest from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, today became the first female bishop in any major branch of <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> that traces it leadership back 2,000 years to the time of Christ. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was consecrated as suffragan, or assistant, Episcopal bishop for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> diocese, a relatively obscure position that has drawn world attention because of her gender, background and liberal views. A large number of bishops attended the stately ceremony at Hynes Veteran Memorial Auditorium, and 2,000 clergy members, lay leaders, ecumenical representatives and civic dignitaries marched in procession. The chief consecrator was the Most Rev. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, presiding bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Just say I'm very proud and very happy. That's all,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` This is something that people feel very right about, very convicted about,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, an Episcopal priest and the master of ceremony. `` And we feel very blessed that we have been chosen to lead the church in new ways.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was greeted by a burst of applause as she walked down the aisle, but there was some protest raised to the consecration. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, chairman of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chapter, spoke during the time allotted for any protest. `` <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, please weigh the consequences. By proceeding with this pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious imposture, you will abandon the communion of all those churches descended from the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and you will destroy the concept of legality in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> responded by saying that such objections had been raised in advance but that the consecration was in accordance with church laws. The audience roared its approval and gave him a standing ovation. The congregation thundered out its approval after <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> asked, `` Is it your will that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> be ordained a bishop?'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became the first female bishop in a branch of Christianity that believes in apostolic succession _ that its leaders are descended from Christ's apostles. Among such denominations are the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> churches and the worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. While her appointment was opposed by some religious leaders because of her gender, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has generated controversy for other reasons. She is divorced, lacks a college or seminary degree and is politically outspoken. In her writings, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has not been shy about blasting conservatives in the church she has been designated to help lead. In an article last April in a liberal church publication, The Witness, the 58-year-old priest took aim at the conservative church <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the group's plan to monitor votes by liberal clergy members at an Episcopal convention. Her writings served to fan the controversy surrounding her election last September. The Rev. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Politzer </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> put it bluntly Friday: `` A bishop is to be a disciple of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. Her hard-line leftist position is not a moderating, reconciling position.'' <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traycik </ORGANIZATION>, editor of The Christian Challenge, a conservative Episcopal publication, said she objected more to the style than the content of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' writings. `` A lot of her stuff shows a distinct lack of charity, a kind of unseemliness,'' <PERSON> Traycik </PERSON> said. The Christian Challenge published a lengthy article in December detailing some of what the paper's editors believed were <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' more objectionable writings Among others, the publication found unacceptable <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' description of the <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> as `` divisive, defiant, deleterious and demonic ...'' But not all the targets of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' pointed pen take issue with her selection Bishop <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> represents <ORGANIZATION> Episcopalians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renewal </ORGANIZATION>, Revelation and Reformation, referred to by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as `` the new 3-R bunch.'' <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> said he voted in support of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' election. `` She'll bring a very peppery perspective,'' <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure that in the house of bishops we're going to be on the opposite sides of a lot of issues I have met her and I liked her. I wish her well.''

 A year after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to Nicaraguan rebels, the guerrilla army created with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance is stranded in an isolated mountain valley without the means to fight. Its men are keeping up their morale with intense training as they listen to the news on the radio and wonder what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy will be `` If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does n't help us, we'll go back to the early days, taking our guns from the ` piricuacos,''' said Contra fighter <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> Severano </PERSON>, using camp slang meaning `` armed dogs'' for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista army Far from Contra directorate members in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, far from the policy considerations of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the guerrillas are aware of what they call `` the situation'' that began when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid Feb. 3, 1988. Contra troops began to move out of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as their supplies dwindled, most of them withdrawing to their main base here along the <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, about 10 miles inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Although they continue be optimistic about prospects for aid, few do not know that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on `` bipartisanship'' and cooperation with the Democratic majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be a death knell to hopes for renewal. Few appear disposed to quit. `` -LRB- Nicaraguan President -RRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says we are a cadaver waiting to be buried. Well, here are 11,000 ` cadavers,' alive,'' said <PERSON> Comandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a member of the general staff who does n't use his real name for reasons of security and esprit de corps Like many Contras, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> takes heart from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economic crash and the cuts the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government says it is making in its defense budget. `` We can beat them even though they outnumber us because we're tougher, like wood They ca n't send draftees from the city after us,'' said `` <PERSON> Comandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliman </PERSON>,'' a battalion leader, his two silver-framed teeth flashing. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and others said groups of rebels still infiltrate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> despite a truce in effect since May, but the scale of the fighting has been drastically reduced. The Contra encampment now spreads for seven miles along the <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and gets larger every day as more small groups emerge from the jungle. The camps are organized by battalion, although some are beginning to take on a settled look; many have brought wives and children from `` the inside.'' A few women work as prostitutes, others have settled into rough wartime relationships. `` The movement is reinforcing itself,'' said a fighter nicknamed `` Penguin.'' A doctor said nearly 600 children were born in the camp last year. The articulate talk idealistically about why they fight; others can say no more than that they left `` because the piricuacos came.'' A few, generally among the higher ranking, were members of former Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s army and fought `` from day one.'' But there are also bricklayers, ranch workers, truckers, doctors, sharecroppers who joined when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government tried to force them into a cooperative. Some said a brother or father was arrested or tortured, and there are those who took the opportunity to shed abusive parents, family problems or a criminal past. They give themselves nicknames like `` Lightning,'' `` Point-Blank,'' `` Leopard,'' and `` Rambo,'' sometimes known as `` Gordo'' behind his back; but also `` Rabbit'' and `` Quetzal,'' an ancient Indian god of the air. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Comandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>,'' keeps his 700 men in shape with volleyball, boxing, marches and extra drills, `` what little we guerrillas know,'' he said apologetically as about 50 recruits executed a sloppy maneuver. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, at 23, twice wounded, is less than half the age of some of the men he commands. `` All that matters here is ability and leadership,'' he said. Armed guards are posted 24 hours a day, patrols move through the hills, and combat discipline is observed on trails _ marchers spread out to prevent casualties, with a rear guard yards behind. Last week there was a brief firefight with leftist Honduran guerrillas, officers said, and there is always the danger of Sandinista infiltrators seeking intelligence. Most men live in 10-by-6-foot huts with camouflage plastic roofs and walls, although some have built straw or wood walls and even small mud-and-wood houses. `` Some guys are architects,'' said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, known as `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>.'' He sticks to plastic, although it gets too hot in the sun. The most permanent structures are at <ORGANIZATION> CIM </ORGANIZATION>, Spanish initials for the Center for Military Instruction. <ORGANIZATION> CIM </ORGANIZATION>, pronounced `` seem,'' is a two-hour hike from the main camp across a jungle mountain trail three feet deep in mud when it rains. Here, even as about 600 men took tests in map reading and military tactics to qualify as officers, others worked on wooden buildings with tin roofs so that classes would not have to be held outdoors or under ponchos. `` We are not wasting our time here. We are preparing ourselves during this pause in the war,'' an instructor told about 40 officer candidates in an open tent. A kitchen turns out 900 handmade tortillas a day; there's also a small slaughterhouse and a pit with a barbed wire grill big enough to barbecue four sides of beef. Some of the beef is sold by local Hondurans at about $ 233 a head. Honduran merchants peddle everything from dandruff shampoo to cowboy boots. Baby clothes and underwear are big sellers. But there also are complaints ranging from drunken driving to rape, although most confess there is much less thievery and lack of discipline than they thought there would be. `` You know that when somebody kills somebody down here, all he has to do is join the Contra and he's safe,'' said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, whose son just opened a tire repair store in <LOCATION> Danli </LOCATION>, 55 miles from the Contra camp and the nearest large town. The trucks <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> services are carrying food paid for by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid program that provides a monotonous but steady diet of beans, rice and tortillas, with occasional meat. Some officers worry about the camp's children. Boys above the age of about 10 work as camp aides; girls work in the kitchens, as do most of their mothers. `` We would like to have AID -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- give us some pencils, chalk and blackboards so we can start schools for the kids and for the illiterate,'' said battalion commander <PERSON> Caliman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caliman </PERSON>, like most others, said he plans to return to his former job `` when we win the war, assuming I'm not dead.'' In his case, sharecropping with coffee-picking in season. `` 19,'' who refused to explain his nickname, was among the less hopeful. He made cigar boxes in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, loved his work and tried to find work at the <LOCATION> Plasencia </LOCATION> cigar factory in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` But you need a Honduran ID and a work permit, and the Honduran unions are tough,'' he said. `` I'm over 50 and I ca n't fight anymore, but I'll go on because I have to.'' His attitude is an exception to the determination expressed by most. `` When I started there was no thought we would ever get aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Adan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Known as <PERSON> Commandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, he brought 30 men, three women and 15 children out of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last week `` because I did n't have anything left to fight with.'' His wife was wounded in the foot during the trip. `` With or without help,'' said the former small-time cattle dealer, `` we'll go on fighting.''

 <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, a tough-talking bank regulator who looks a little like <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warbucks </PERSON>, is braced for his good name to get splattered quickly now that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made him deposit insurance czar and plopped the savings and loan crisis in his lap. In more than three years at the helm of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which backs commercial bank deposits, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, 67, has acquired a reputation as a straight shooter. When his agency announces good news such as a jump in bank profits, he's more likely to focus on negatives, such as an uptick in bad loans in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> or banks' growing dependence on leveraged buyouts. Over the past year, congressional committees, unhappy with what they viewed as overly-rosy estimates from S & amp; L regulators at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, increasingly have turned to <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> for information about savings and loans, even though they were n't under his jurisdiction `` His personality is very blunt. He's a no-nonsense guy and he does n't mince words,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON>, a banking expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. `` I think a lot of politicians appreciate that.'' `` Seidman is an old hand and has the confidence of people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' explained Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` And he's been right on the issue. Unlike the bank board he has not had to change his tune every few months.'' Although <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> has presided over the worst three years for bank failures since the Depression, he also has had two important advantages not enjoyed by <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, his counterpart for S & amp; Ls: a large, experienced staff that had escaped Reagan-era budget cuts, and a solvent insurance fund. Now that <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to resolve the savings and loan crisis, gets actual, not just defacto, authority over <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, he may be in for tougher times. Many people, including the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman himself, think the era of good feelings could quickly end as the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> wrestles with the intractable thrift problem. `` I think you will shortly be doing a story on this guy's the most inept, mud-covered regulator we've ever seen. How could we have ever thought he's reasonably good,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, a short, nearly-bald, craggy-featured man, predicted in a recent interview. Commercial banking, despite all the failures, is relatively healthy, posting record high earnings last year. The savings industry, by any measure, is ailing. About 350 of the 3,000 S & amp; Ls in the nation are insolvent. The business lost more money in 1988 than at any time in 50 years. And, only one in four institutions now have enough money invested by their owners to meet the stricter capital standards <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would require in two years. `` We're going ... into a very difficult situation to which every answer will be painful ... and which contains all kinds of booby traps and not many rewards,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. `` There are n't going to be any miracles.'' Others are n't as pessimistic, at least about the prospects for <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>'s reputation. `` Seidman is coming in at the right time,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who retired this year after 30 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` People realize S & amp; Ls are in horrible shape. ... It's like coming in to coach a football team that has had a disastrous season. ... If he wins three or four games, he's a genius.'' Some in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> is already a genius for having doubled his power and simultaneously protected the bank insurance fund from being raided to pay for S & amp; L problems. When asked, in the months leading up to the announcement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L proposal, whether he wanted jurisdiction over thrift institutions, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> had a stock answer, `` We prefer to go it alone, but we're willing to help if asked.'' Even now he insists, `` It was not a job we wanted. We never asked for it. ... There was no hidden agenda for us to end up where we are now.'' But, a senior bank board official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, `` He had a very good set of cards and he played them very well.'' `` In a city where turf is your measure of success, he's very quietly amassing a very big one and very coyly as well,'' said <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> aide, now on the staff of the Investor Responsibility Research Center. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>'s strong suit in the struggle has been his long-standing ties to the Republican establishment dating back to the administration of <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a boyhood friend from Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> became president, he hired <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, head of a family-owned accounting firm, to be a White House assistant for economic affairs. It was <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> who interviewed <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> should nominate the economist as chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. During the Ford years, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> worked closely with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, then an assistant secretary of commerce, and with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, then a young <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> aide. That's the same <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> who is secretary of state now, the same <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> who is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> traveled often to <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to review <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> economic reports with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. He has known Secretary of the Treasury <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> for 30 years. `` <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> called me up the other day and said, ` Now that you've got all your proteges in office, what are you going to do?' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` I'm going to retire and enjoy it.''' But that wo n't be until the administration's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L program is well under way, he said. Another asset that helps <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> win over Democrats is his pragmatism, according to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's been around the block four of five times. ... He's not an ideologue,'' <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said. That's obvious from <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>'s successful effort to block several S & amp; L proposals pushed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s more conservative advisers. When word of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to impose a direct fee on depositors leaked, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> dubbed it `` the reverse toaster plan. Instead of getting a toaster when you open an account, you give them one.'' The remark reportedly infuriated White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> is n't apologetic. `` I was n't trying to be obstreperous. On the other hand, I did think it was a very bad idea and I thought it might be better to try to deal with it with humor rather than analysis,'' he said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> also is fighting an idea, advocated by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and others, that lowering the $ 100,000 deposit insurance limit would give bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L customers incentive to make sure their institutions are soundly managed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to study the issue for a year. `` Who in the world wants to get people thinking in a public way that they're going to change deposit insurance?'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> asked.

 To the public, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> is a silent victim, a comatose woman who was at the center of a highly publicized legal whirlwind over whether her husband could order an abortion. But to her friends and family she is outgoing, a fashion designer, a gourmet cook, a model mother who would n't welcome the publicity. `` It's very frustrating not being able to tell <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> about all of this,'' said her husband, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, as he tried to avoid hordes of television camera crews and reporters outside court. `` She just would n't believe this.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, lost consciousness on Dec. 13 when her car skidded on snow and was struck by an oncoming car. She suffered massive brain damage. Doctors told her husband of nine years, a 34-year-old accountant, that she stood a better chance of surviving if the fetus she was carrying was aborted. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> went to court to be named her guardian so he could arrange an abortion. Guardianship was granted, but abortion opponents challenged the ruling, delaying the procedure by appeals. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the state's highest court, refused to hear the case and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> did the same. Early Saturday, the abortion was performed on Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who friends said would be mortified if she knew of the attention paid to her case. `` We were uncomfortable at first going to her hospital room when we heard she was in the accident,'' said <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>, a close friend. `` We knew she would be embarrassed to have people see her that way.'' She was described as the first to help out, slow to anger, an eager hostess. `` You could drop in for a surprise visit at 11 o'clock at night,'' <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> recalls. `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> would pull out an unbelievable spread of food from the refrigerator _ gourmet dishes which she had made herself.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> worked as a freelance textile designer, designing embroidered patterns. Most of her designs were for expensive silk blouses made by major manufacturers. `` During certain seasons she would spend weeks at a time running into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to meet with clients,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. Mostly, she spent time with the couple's 3-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Arielle </PERSON>. `` They would bake brownies and sit for hours together in <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s art studio drawing puppets and pictures,'' said a friend, <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> `` She would dress <PERSON> Arielle </PERSON> up in outfits that she'd make prettier by painting pictures on a blouse or sticking rhinestone designs on,'' she said. She cooks _ `` quiches, breads, pastry _ everything was made from scratch,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> _ and decorates the family home. She sends balloons to friends on birthdays, devises ways to cheer others when they are down. Last year, as a birthday present for <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> took him breakfast in bed. `` We could n't believe it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> said. `` She came with <PERSON> Arielle </PERSON> real early in the morning with a beautifully decorated tray with an outrageous feast she had prepared.'' Her friends wish they could turn the clock back, <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> said. `` She was so full of life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main rebel group says it has the military might to overthrow <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s government, but analysts dismiss the claim and say the insurgents' latest raid severely damaged their <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdavi </PERSON>, a senior official of the Iraqi-based <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION>, would not say how long it might take to overthrow <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic fundamentalist government, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary. `` If you look at the divisions ... inside the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> regime, and compare it to the resistance ready at any time to overthrow the regime, you can not seriously speak about needing years,'' he said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've shown that we have the ability to militarily overthrow this regime.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>'s military arm, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, made a large-scale incursion into western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> just before the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. The rebels still hand out literature by the pound claiming the raid, called Eternal Light, was a major victory, but diplomats say <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Revolutionary Guards soundly beat the insurgents. The Mujahedeen is believed to have no more than 15,000 fighters, and it admits losing 1,000 in the raid. In addition, thousands of their supporters in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were arrested and many were believed executed. Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Eternal Light undermined whatever support the rebels had in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Talk of overthrowing <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is `` sheer dreaming and sheer stupidity'' said one Western military analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` What could they do? Where would they go? They got destroyed in the Eternal Light operation.'' Much of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s civilian population has been moved away from the border during the Iran-Iraq war, so capturing territory would be a limited threat to the government, analysts said. They argued that since the million-strong, high-tech <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army could not overwhelm the Iranians in eight years of war, it is highly unlikely the rebels could. Even if the rebels did have an army ready to cross the border, the analysts said, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> appears committed to peace negotiations and probably would not allow the insurgents to attack. Iraqi officials declined to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>'s future. `` Everything on those issues will be dependent on Iranian behavior,'' said deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nizar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdoon </PERSON>. `` It's premature to address this point at the moment. The Mujahedeen appear to have broad support in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. They still broadcast a nightly half-hour television program and one diplomat noted the post office box listed on their official paper is the same used by the Culture and <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has expelled Iranian resistance groups before. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> himself spent 15 years in the holy city of <LOCATION> Najaf </LOCATION> but was asked to leave in 1978 during a moment of detente in Iran-Iraq relations. <PERSON> Mahdavi </PERSON> conceded a peace treaty might mean <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would bar the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> from staging military operations across the border. He would not say if the rebels are conducting operations now. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> were allied with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in the 1979 revolution that toppled <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s monarchy. But the fundamentalists turned on their liberal allies in 1981 and killed thousands in a bloody purge. Peace negotiations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been stalled since November. <PERSON> Mahdavi </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of delaying talks because of internal differences and said a treaty might trigger a civil war. `` At that time the <ORGANIZATION> NLA </ORGANIZATION> ... will embark on overthrowing the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> regime,'' <PERSON> Mahdavi </PERSON> said.

 A man who has pleaded guilty to wild animal poaching charges kept a ledger that shows he netted about $ 600,000 from the illegal slaughter of hundreds of animals, including bald eagles, officials said. The ledger taken from the home of <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sequim </LOCATION> indicates he poached at least 25 bald eagles and hundreds of other wild animals, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Perregrin </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference Friday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 38, was charged with poaching 13 elk in late September after an anonymous caller told officials <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had an illegally obtained polar bear skin, <PERSON> Perregrin </PERSON> said. Investigators never found the polar bear skin, but they discovered illegally obtained elk and deer, and the ledger, <PERSON> Perregrin </PERSON> said. Sales listed in the ledger over 3 -LCB- years include 25 eagles sold for $ 512,650, 135 elk for $ 28,500, 286 deer for $ 24,270, 18 native cats for $ 15,150, 12 seals for $ 14,500 and nine hawks for $ 2,775. The ledger also listed purchasers and the investigation continues, <PERSON> Perregrin </PERSON> said. Federal authorities arrested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in October after he threatened the lives of a witness in the eagle transactions and several investigating officers and their families, <PERSON> Perregrin </PERSON> said. The department has talked to many local people who knew <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was a poacher, <PERSON> Perregrin </PERSON> said. But no one knew the extent of his activities and just assumed he took a deer or two for dinner for the family. Records indicate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was receiving public assistance. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Clallam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> counties to poaching charges and was sentenced to up to 24 years in prison, <PERSON> Perregrin </PERSON> said. He also pleaded guilty to 10 federal felony counts of selling bald eagles and one count of threatening a federal witness. He is in custody awaiting sentencing Feb. 23 on the federal counts, and could face additional prison time and millions of dollars in fines. His wife <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> also pleaded guilty in connection with the poaching, he said.

<HEAD>1989 Federal Deficit Grows As Budget Spotlight Shifts to 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The unveiling of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1990 spending plan focuses the budget spotlight on the coming fiscal year _ just as the deficit figures for this year are getting more and more embarrassing. The imbalance is not only expanding like a wet blot of red ink on a piece of paper. But once again _ as has happened every year since the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law was passed in 1985 _ the actual deficit is going to be far higher than the deficit ceiling the legislation sets. The budget <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for fiscal 1990 last Thursday revealed that the administration now expects the 1989 deficit to be $ 170.2 billion. Less than four months ago, the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration forecast that the imbalance would be $ 145.5 billion _ $ 500 million below the $ 146 billion target set in the Gramm-Rudman law. `` It's a co-conspiracy between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration,'' says <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penner </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` And it's hard to think of any other word to describe it than dishonest.'' <PERSON> Penner </PERSON>, now a senior fellow at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was referring to the process set in law that is designed to force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the federal deficit. Lawmakers and the president spend most of each year dueling with each other over the budget, with much of their battling devoted to deciding how they will produce a spending plan that meets the deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Every year, the smoke clears in the fall or winter to reveal an agreement in which the projected red ink falls just within the deficit target. And the awesome hammer of the law _ forced spending cuts on domestic and defense programs, totaling billions of dollars _ is avoided. But the key word here is `` projected.'' The Gramm-Rudman law is a process that deals with the projected deficit for the coming year, setting declining ceilings for each year until the budget is supposed to be balanced in 1993. If the final projection for each fiscal year _ made in mid-October, two weeks into that year _ falls within the target, the automatic cuts are avoided. But once the projected deficit is certified as falling within the target, the law's machinery grinds to a halt. The law sets no consequences if the actual deficit at the end of the year turns out to be higher than the Gramm-Rudman target. Budget experts say the deficit projections are off because of the difficulties of predicting how the economy will perform and how quickly some programs will spend money. They say that in addition, the economic forecasts used are optimistic and thus underestimate the magnitude of the shortfall. After all, it's easier to pronounce the deficit smaller than it is to say it is larger and then have to enact spending cuts and tax increases to shrink it. `` They're avoiding political pain,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Collender </PERSON>, who oversees budget policy for the Price Waterhouse accounting firm. Some say the way <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House focus each year on deficit projections is such a charade that the press is partially to blame for paying so much attention to it. `` We're all a little surprised that you all report that in such a straight-faced manner,'' says <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, president of the bipartisan watchdog group, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Experts are divided over just how significant it is that the target is consistently missed. Some, like <PERSON> Penner </PERSON>, say it is deceptive and postpones true deficit-reduction decisions. Others, like <PERSON> Collender </PERSON>, say a deficit difference of a few billion dollars in a $ 5 trillion economy is relatively harmless. Following are the deficit targets for each fiscal year since Gramm-Rudman took effect, and the actual deficits that occurred: _ 1986: target $ 171.9 billion, deficit $ 221 billion _ 1987: target $ 144 billion, deficit $ 150.4 billion _ 1988: target $ 144 billion, deficit $ 155 billion Only in 1986 were automatic spending cuts triggered by the Gramm-Rudman law.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been consulting with Mexican lawmakers on ways to help reduce that country's massive foreign debt and expand its market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm goods. `` The long-term potential for the growth of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' exports is greater in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> than in virtually any other country in the world,'' said Rep. E. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kika </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, in a recent interview The comment came following a meeting last week with three members of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is already our third-largest trading partner in the world and the potential for expansion of that trade is directly proportional to our ability to foster trade in both directions,'' said de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said he urged the three senators _ <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Niebla </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bulmaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> _ to weigh the idea of a free-trade agreement with this country, similar to the ones the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Those agreements call for elimination of most tariffs between the parties over the next decade. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said that to begin with such an accord with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could be limited to individual sectors such as automotive or agriculture. He said he is also asking <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to consider broadening banking guidelines to permit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to capitalize part of its external debt _ a means of converting interest on the debt into part of the loan. That way less cash would leave <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to service its $ 105 billion debt, and the money could be injected into the economy to produce additional exports, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. He said it would generate badly needed export income and create jobs in a country experiencing an unemployment rate of about 20 percent. The money could also be used to buy more imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` The economic prosperity of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is in our best interests since an economically and politically unstable <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> might prove to be a national security risk for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said.

 A motto in Latin about grapes and the meaning of life brought a touch of class to `` Lonesome Dove'' even if <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrae </PERSON> did n't know what it meant and Latin scholars have differing interpretations. `` It's a motto. ... It just says itself,'' <PERSON> McCrae </PERSON> explained to his partner, <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Call </PERSON>, in <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. But that did n't satisfy the public, which has been clamoring for an explanation ever since the book was turned into a hit <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> miniseries, broadcast last week. `` We got about 15 to 20 calls the day after the final episode,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Friday. The four-day series wound up Wednesday. The motto, `` Uva uvam vivendo varia fit,'' appeared on the sign for the <ORGANIZATION> Hat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> and Livery Emporium. <PERSON> McCrae </PERSON> thought that whatever it meant, it would lend some dignity to the sign. In the TV series, the motto also became <PERSON> McCrae </PERSON>'s epitaph as Call used the remains of the sign to mark his grave. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said researcher <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> translated the motto as: `` The grape is made manifold by living.'' Two Latin scholars offered different views. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas-Arlington </ORGANIZATION>, says it's `` A grape becomes mature by living only as a grape.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> MacQueen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> translates it as `` A grape becomes a different kind of grape by living _ or in the process of living.'' <PERSON> MacQueen </PERSON> added that the motto was improperly constructed, saying that under Latin's complex rules for the endings of words, the `` uvam'' should be another `` uva.'' He called it `` a mistake that a schoolboy who was learning to write Latin might make.'' Uva or uvam, <PERSON> MacQueen </PERSON> said he was pleased with the interest in Latin aroused by the story. `` We're not going to look any gift publicity in the mouth,'' he said.

 A young man who rides in a limo and wears a white tuxedo, top hat, red bow tie and dark sunglasses has become a mysterious hero by handing out $ 50 bills to charities. <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> employees watched in disbelief Friday as the man gave them the money, then quietly got back into the back seat of a gray, chauffeur-driven limousine.

 Federal authorities should expand tough new anti-terrorism measures to cover foreign air carriers with landing rights in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, says the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> released Saturday he was `` dismayed'' that emergency security precautions taken after the holiday bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 apply only to domestic carriers with international flights. `` I do not think it requires a quantum leap in logic to conclude that as it becomes more difficult to penetrate the security of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag carriers because of their superior security systems, the terrorist threat may well shift to foreign air carriers which carry a large number of American passengers,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. About half of Americans traveling abroad fly on foreign carriers, he said. `` If the primary basis for the emergency rulemaking is to minimize terrorism aimed at Americans particularly and the international traveling public generally, then I do not see how it is accomplished by a blanket exemption to foreign air carriers to the requirement for improved security operations,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in late December announced tightened security procedures by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers at 103 airports in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including X-ray or physical inspection of all checked baggage and random physical checks of some carry-on baggage. The added measures were prompted by the bombing of Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, which 270 persons dead. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the measures did not go far enough. `` The problem is that they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- offered a half a loaf and half a loaf is just not good enough when you're talking about terrorism,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was also urging <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to have the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> coordinate its activities with the intelligence community in tracking terrorist activity and guarding against sabotage. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> will head a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and Thursday in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, where protecting aviation from terrorists will be discussed.

 There's barely a decimal point's difference between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budgets. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan is packaged to make the changes he's made look more dramatic. He tries to put the most shine on the least shoe _ to reflect toward <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the things they want to see _ by following the time-honored <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tradition of jumbling the numbers. On the one hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s kinder and gentler budget includes freezing the military budget, a sharp departure from the growth advocated by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He defines the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> freeze as increasing spending $ 2.1 billion to keep pace with inflation _ a so-called `` current services'' freeze. But elsewhere in his budget, he ridicules the concept of maintaining current services as defining a freeze. Assuming adjustments to cover inflationary costs in domestic programs is `` wonderland budgeting,'' he says. His budget compares the domestic budgets with current fiscal 1989 levels, without mention of what providing the same services would cost next year. This approach allows <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to minimize the appearance of cuts and maximize the apparent increases in his fiscal 1990 plan. In sum, increasing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending with inflation is a freeze in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget. Increasing the education budget, but not enough to maintain current services, is not a freeze. Along the same lines, the president studiously avoids direct comparisons with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spending plan. He claims with some fanfare initiatives to increase spending on AIDS research and the space program. Compared to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, there's no increase at all. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> numbers are n't in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s book. You have to go to another document to find them. Further complicating any comparisons with his predecessor, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget drafters calculated his figures without the credit reforms that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> included in his accounting That technical difference makes some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s numbers look hundreds of millions of dollars different from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s when, in many cases, they are exactly the same. In the case of fighting drugs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new spending initiative is n't so new. Three quarters of the nearly $ 1 billion <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims as his anti-drug program is money already approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Mostly, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget as revealed so far is incomplete. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explicitly changes only about four dozen out of some 4,000 line items in the budget left behind by his predecessor. It claims to be increasing spending on important domestic programs, but often lists them within a group where the total spending is unchanged from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan. It does n't say what other programs in that group would go down to compensate, or by how much. Budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Thursday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rejecting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to reduce school lunch programs by $ 800 million. That change from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plan is nowhere in the budget document he released, and there's no indication where the spending would be cut to make up the difference. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> says the administration is projecting about $ 9.6 billion in total savings from hundreds of programs placed in a so-called flexible freeze box _ with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take a lead role in deciding which individual programs to cut, which to increase and which to keep static. Other analysts say the administration seems to be counting on about $ 11 billion in savings from that `` box'' approach. But spelling out the billions of dollars in cuts implicit in the plan would give more ammunition to critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere. It would dull the shine.

Most highs statewide were only in the 30s for most of the week, and lows were in the 20s with wind chill factors in the teens. Temperatures Saturday warmed up into the 50s and 60s.

The appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` is in a position to disclose highly sensitive classified information at trial, and it appears that the government will not be accorded its ... procedural rights. `` Proceeding with the trial on those terms will make it impossible for the attorney general to fulfill his responsibility to safeguard classified information,'' the appeal said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has failed to impose stringent enough controls on what classified material North may use at trial on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. A jury in the case was chosen Thursday and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> asked them to return to court Monday morning. `` Unfortunately, the judge in this case has chosen not to follow the provisions'' of the Classified Information Procedures Act, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. In a 14-page appeals court filing, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said `` the extraordinary developments in this proceeding that have transpired over the past few days are the consequence of'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s `` repeated refusal'' to follow the pre-trial procedures set out under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> sets up screening procedures for use of classified material in criminal cases. The attorney general also criticized independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, for opposing the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to delay the case. `` I do n't understand why the independent counsel does n't share with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> the desire to see that the law that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed is followed,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in an interview with reporters and editors of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can not explain it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> court filing said `` decisions about the disclosure of national security information fall well beyond the immediate concerns of an individual prosecutor whose interests are confined by the desire to prosecute a particular case.'' Until Wednesday, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had been cooperating in trying to overcome the problems classified material is presenting in the case. In a Jan. 19 order under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that <PERSON> North </PERSON> may use classified material that tends to show that his intent and purpose was not to violate the law. Another section of the order allows North to use classified material to show that a statement made by a government witness during the trial is false or misleading. Intelligence agencies felt this gave <PERSON> North </PERSON> too much leeway to present classified material in the courtroom. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> later rejected a government request to set up a mechanism by which <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers would be required to provide advance notice or obtain an order from the court before disclosing classified information. The department on Wednesday began seeking a court order barring North from disclosing any classified information to which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has an objection pending. In rejecting the department's request, the three-member panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> noted that the legal avenue left open to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is to file an affidavit under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> declaring that certain classified information could harm national security. Such a step could lead to dismissal of at least some of the criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and to possibly throwing out the entire case. Once the attorney general files an affidavit, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> would be required to order that <PERSON> North </PERSON> not disclose that classified material which is at issue. Such a procedure could force dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> because he would be unable to introduce evidence that would prove him innocent.

<HEAD>Canadians Want Specifics on Acid Rain Promise</HEAD>

 Running under Canadian satisfaction with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to act on acid rain is a bitter current that says, `` It's about time.'' There also is considerable reluctance to get too complacent until specifics of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s program are known. On <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first trip outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since his inauguration, he promised Friday to move quickly with congressional legislation to control acid rain. He also said after his meetings with Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would move toward discussions with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for an accord on the controversial issue. `` The president's comments on the subject mark a small step forward in the longstanding environmental dispute between the two countries,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail newspaper wrote Saturday. `` However, without an exact <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> timetable for the discussions, or commitments on the amount or timing of any cuts on transborder air pollution, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> may still have to wait years before there is tangible relief on the issue,'' the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> daily wrote in front-page coverage of the visit. Canadian concern about the acid rain, blamed for killing some 14,000 lakes in the eastern part of the country and defoliating millions of acres of forests, has been a dominant issue in relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the past decade. One of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s two official visits to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as vice president was in January 1987, when he came to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s complaints that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was holding back on acid rain cleanup Frustration grew in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> during the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, when the pomp of summit meetings produced virtually no results on the issue. For example, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did not once propose legislation to strengthen the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal Clean Air Act. More than half the acid rain in eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> comes from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and in some areas <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emissions of sulphur dioxide and other materials cause 70 percent of acid fallout, according to the Canadian government. The program to control Canadian emissions takes full effect in 1994. `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach is a 180-degree reversal in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Perley </PERSON> of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Acid Rain lobbying group. He told reporters that while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not even recognize acid rain as a problem, the situation now is that `` we've got the right principle, the right approach.'' <PERSON> Perley </PERSON> also said the specific amount of emissions to be cut and the timetable for doing so are critical. Senior Canadian diplomatic officials, speaking on condition they not be further identified, said they understand <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s need to outline the specifics to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> first. At a joint news conference with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the president's position `` represents quite substantial progress. You know, it was n't so long ago that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was sort of going it alone in many ways in this area.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he assured <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> `` that the time for just pure study was over and that we've now approached the time for legislative action.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> apparently would be willing to start talks for the bilateral agreement <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> long has sought on acid rain after the legislation is moving forward, possibly as early as this year. Environmental concerns ran strong among Canadian voters polled during the campaign last fall that returned <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for a second consecutive majority government. Indeed, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was reminded by a reporter as she toured the National Gallery of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that lakes portrayed in the paintings she was seeing were endangered by acid rain.

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was in critical but stable condition Saturday after suffering a relapse in his bout with pneumonia and bronchial asthma, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, had been in guarded condition Friday, but began running a fever, said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been confined since Jan. 19. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in the hospital's intensive care unit and was still breathing with the aid of a respirator, according to a statement issued Saturday morning. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' worsened condition `` means there is infection again,'' said <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family spokesman. `` I would suspect it's the lungs because of the tracheostomy.'' A tracheostomy, a surgical incision in the trachea, was done Feb. 1 to relieve a buildup of fluid in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lungs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, have lived here since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ouster from power in February 1986. The Marcoses are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for allegedly stealing more than $ 100 million from their homeland and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Defense lawyers for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> asked a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday to remove the former president from a racketeering case for medical reasons. Federal prosecutors opposed the move, saying it was too soon to make a final prognosis of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chances for recovery.

 It was the $ 2,500 watch and the $ 13,000 Mustang that put authorities on the trail of 18-year-old <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON>. Investigators say the high school senior attended school regularly while running a cocaine business on the side and spending thousands of dollars on cars, clothes and jewelry. The teen-ager's fast-lane lifestyle came to a halt Jan. 18 as he prepared to go to school in this suburb east of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Undercover police surrounded his car and arrested him on charges of possession and delivery of a controlled substance. Officers found 4 ounces of cocaine, five firearms and $ 18,000 in cash. Also seized was a <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corvette </ORGANIZATION>, customized <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> and a Chevrolet Blazer. In November 1987, when he was 16, <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> was arrested on a drug-possession charge. His mother, <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON>, told authorities at the time she thought he was a dealer, but the possession case never went to trial. The Regional Organized Crime Task Force, an interagency law enforcement group, began investigating <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> in earnest last year after parents and businessmen told police about his spending sprees, said investigator <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. Reports of an $ 1,800 clothes-buying trip and the purchase of the $ 2,500 watch crossed detectives' desks. `` We began looking at his activities and found that he was purchasing vehicles for cash,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` He purchased a 1986 Mustang on Sept. 24, 10 days after his 18th birthday, for $ 13,000 cash. `` He moved into a $ 1,000-a-month apartment on Aug. 8. We looked at cash expenditures of $ 25,000 over a one-month period,'' he said. `` It all began to develop a pattern not consistent with a high school student.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> did most of his business from his third-floor apartment at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landing </ORGANIZATION>, a trendy section of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> a world away from <LOCATION> Gresham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> did n't use drugs himself, maintained a low profile at the apartment and was known as a `` nice guy'' at school, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` Four or five primary customers of <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON>'s were the only ones who came to the apartment,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` There were no wild parties.'' Investigators believe <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> was a relatively small-scale dealer until he met <PERSON> Narcisa </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Savinovich </PERSON>, who was at the time free pending appeal after being sentenced to five years in prison for selling cocaine. The night before his arrest last month, <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> stopped at the 26-year-old woman's house and emerged with two paper bags, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Savinovich </PERSON> was arrested, indicted on new drug charges, and immediately began serving her previously imposed sentence. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, special assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, said <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> charges against <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> have been withdrawn so that he can be prosecuted in the federal system, where stiffer sentences are possible. A federal grand jury is considering the case. While the 390 other students in <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON>'s senior class dream about life after graduation, <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> is keeping silent about his future. He has been expelled from school and is back home in <LOCATION> Gresham </LOCATION>, living with his mother, a parole and probation officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` My lawyer advised me not to say anything at all,'' <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> said over the telephone. His mother also had no comment. At <ORGANIZATION> Gresham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> said he thought it was a `` farce'' that <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON> was released after putting up $ 650 of $ 6,500 bail after his arrest. <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> said rumors about <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON>'s drug trade had been circulating for some time. `` His arrest was not a surprise,'' he said. `` He was a shrewd student who stayed out of trouble here. But he was not your typical student who all of a sudden gets involved with a drug problem.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said he hopes <PERSON> Wolsky </PERSON>'s arrest will send a message that will deter classmates from dealing drugs, but, `` Unfortunately, the only message they may get is do n't be quite so flamboyant with your proceeds.'' <PERSON> Carri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, the high school's student-body president, was similarly pessimistic about the effect of the arrest. `` It will be helpful in slowing down drug dealing for a while, but it will be a short-term effect,'' she said. `` We will graduate, a new class will come in, and someone new will start getting rich.''

 They used to be sharecroppers, or soldiers, or just sons and daughters. Now they call themselves `` fighters,'' `` commandos'' or `` guerrillas.'' There are more than 11,000 of them camped in the hills of eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, hoping for further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid that will allow them to resume their fight. Here is a look at some of the people who make up the Contras: <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornejo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, 55, and solid as a rock. A sharecropper and coffee-picker near <LOCATION> Jicara </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>; Said he joined the rebels two years ago to avoid forced recruitment into the Sandinista reserve. Brought his wife and children out at the end of January because `` the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were spying on them and harassing them, saying they were helping the commandos. Which they were.'' Proudly introduces <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armando </PERSON>, 12; <ORGANIZATION> Maria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION>, 10; <PERSON> Arbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>, 7; and `` the big jolly one,'' Concha, 17. They live with two other families in a cramped mud house at the <LOCATION> Kilali </LOCATION> battalion camp. Pastor <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 78, `` Granadillo.'' Calls himself the oldest Contra, said he last went `` inside'' three years ago but rheumatism prevents him from going again. He owned a coffee farm that produced 150 quintals, or about 30,000 pounds, of beans a year. Normally jolly, he fills the air with curses as he says of the Sandinistas, `` Those dogs stole my farm.'' His six sons also joined the rebels; one has been killed, buried in the mountains. His wife is dead. `` <PERSON> Comandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>,'' 38. Head of the Center for Military Instruction and also of Contra intelligence. A man of cynical cast, he looks much older than 38. He served in dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s army and received training at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as well as from Argentine intelligence during a time of severe repression. He is among the few who wear an insignia of rank. His mottos, such as `` A leader must be clear about the values he defends,'' decorate blackboards at the school. He has not seen his wife and children in a year; they live in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Adan </PERSON>, `` Quetzal,'' 18, from <LOCATION> Danli </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He joined the Nicaraguan rebels because `` I felt like it.'' He was wounded in the right hip, now his foot goes to sleep on long marches. He carries a KRT15, a plastic version of the M-16, because it's light, but would prefer the heavier and more powerful Belgian FAL. He was in <LOCATION> Danli </LOCATION> recently but did n't visit his parents. Has a Honduran fiance in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trojes </LOCATION>, 12 miles away, and a Nicaraguan `` woman'' in the Yamales camp. `` I'm married for a little while,'' he laughs. When the war ends he plans to join the Salvadoran army and keep on fighting. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Comandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>,'' 23, and looks like a teen-ager. Commander of the <LOCATION> Kilali </LOCATION> battalion. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> just found out his parents moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I gave up wealth for the truth that we are now living. There's life and blood here.'' Did n't tell his mother he'd been wounded twice. Last year he married <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Maren </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a woman he met while fighting in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. They live together in a 10-by-6 foot hut and are trying for children. `` We're doing our part, anyway. They are obviously in love. `` Leopard,'' 14. A go-fer at general staff headquarters, he refuses to give his name `` for security reasons.'' Knows how to clean a rifle with a toothbrush. Two years ago, while his family was working as day laborers on a hacienda, he had a fight with his father over chores; his father beat him. Next day a rebel patrol came by and `` Leopard'' joined them. Since then his father has joined the Sandinista army. `` My father's a piricuaco now. He'd kill me if he found me.'' Does n't know what he wants to do when he grows up. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, called `` Marbelit,'' 19. A cook at the Center for Military Instruction. Left home and walked into the hills where she met a Contra patrol because `` the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> tortured my brother.'' A family of sharecroppers. Likes having so many men around `` so I can make tortillas for all of them.'' Much ribald laughter from all within earshot. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, 28. A former sharecropper who did n't want to join a Sandinista cooperative, which would have prevented him from selling much of his crop to the highest bidder. Now an officer candidate, he has n't seen his wife and two children in six years. `` It's sad.'' He shrugs. His cheek and lip are scarred by a bullet wound. What will he do when the war is over? `` Look for a new life as a sharecropper.''

<TEXT>
 The thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations has warmed up the world of art with the just-announced October mingling of the priceless Faberge egg collections owned by capitalist <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The exchange is very closely related to the improvement of relations,'' <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimtseva </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday through an interpreter. `` Only when countries and people trust each other can such an exchange take place.'' `` We're calling this egg-nost,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, whose billionaire father owns a dozen of the Imperial Eggs. The hand-crafted artworks were designed between 1884 and 1917 and presented to the Russian czars <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The Soviets own 10 of the hand-crafted eggs; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, whose city will be host of the `` Treasures of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' exhibition from Oct. 21-Nov. 11, said the exact number of eggs on display is under negotiation `` Obviously this is a first not only for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> but for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` It means a lot for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. We're just very pleased.'' As part of the deal, several of <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION>' eggs will subsequently go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for display in the Kremlin. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> agreed that the Soviets' new openness was the key to the unprecedented loans. `` Such a thing has never happened before. Even during previous thaws, we were never able to get the eggs rolling,'' he said. According to <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the ground-breaking exhibition was arranged with less trouble and international red tape than she anticipated when the idea first came up. `` It was my dream to have the Soviet eggs in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Madam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimtseva </PERSON>'s dream to have Mr. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' eggs in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' she explained. `` She agreed to loan her eggs if Mr. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> would do the same.'' Although <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said he quickly agreed to this swap, he never believed it would come about. `` I said yes with the firm belief that nobody would call,'' he said. `` When they did, I had to convince my father to let them go.'' According to <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, the final factor which convinced his father to go along was the attitude of the Soviet government toward the wealthy thrill-seeker. `` The fact that they treated us like another government convinced the capitalist tool to go along,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Facing Impeachment Trial Hits The Road Seeking Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, his impeachment trial in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> near, has been on the road trying to rally support for what he concedes is a come-from-behind effort. `` I have an uphill battle, all the way ...,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> told listeners on a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> radio station talk show last week. `` It's going to be very difficult for me to extricate myself from this. History demands that I try.'' It was typical of the speaking appearances he's been making each week on radio shows and at churches, colleges and civil rights groups. With his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial expected to begin as early as mid-March, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 52, has been urging listeners to write their senators to express interest in his case and contribute to his legal defense fund. Although the judge is often warmly received, he has raised only $ 4,000. He unsuccessfully asked for government help for his defense expenses, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 2 million for `` a witch hunt'' or `` fishing expedition'' against him. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> became the first black federal judge from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when he was appointed by then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1979. He marked another, less happy first last August when he became the only person ever to be impeached after he was already cleared of similar charges in a criminal trial. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to impeach, or send the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for trial, was 413-3. He is accused of conspiring with a former friend, attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders, to reduce a sentence of two convicted racketeers, and of lying and fabricating his defense during his 1983 criminal trial. Though <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in that trial, Borders was convicted of bribery conspiracy in a separate trial. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> dealt <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> another setback by deciding his trial would be largely conducted by a 12-member special committee before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes on whether to convict. A two-thirds majority would result in <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' removal from the bench. On Friday, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> law professor, said he would file challenges to the Rules Committee decision along with motions to dismiss the 17 articles of impeachment. He contends that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is unconstitutionally being tried twice for the same case, because of the criminal trial. Supporters of the impeachment answer that just because a charge is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury's satisfaction does not mean that a judge is fit to stay on the bench. The defense also argues that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may be trying to influence judicial independence through coercion. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> says the racial question bears on his troubles, but is not the only cause. `` I'm not going to go up to the Beltway and say, ` Leave me alone because I'm black,''' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. But he usually adds: `` I do not believe I would be in this situation if I were not black.'' He says he was targeted by a federal sting operation in 1981 because of his liberal record on the bench, particularly his strong opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deportations of Haitian aliens. Judicial colleagues acted against him because he `` was n't a member of the club'' and because many of `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ideologues'' want to keep the minorities and women appointed during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration in check, he argued. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> called the overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote `` rank politics.'' Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Democrat and longtime political ally of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, said he voted for impeachment even though such a vote was unlikely to help him politically. He said he looked over the evidence carefully and felt he had no choice. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> pointed out, though, that the impeachment was more like an indictment and does n't mean he presumes <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is guilty. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> reflected that his place in the history of the civil rights movement would be determined by the trial's outcome. `` I may be considered a visionary, someone who fought the odds,'' he said. `` Or I could be remembered only for being removed from the bench.''

<HEAD>Contradictions Cited In Tower Testimony About Defense Firm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> his work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to reports published Saturday. Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s background investigation of the embattled nominee. One newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were overlooked in the probe. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has put the nomination of Tower, a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits, including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors. Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending, has denied in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties. A White House spokesman, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, declined on Saturday to comment on the latest reports, saying `` it's -LRB- the nomination -RRB- before the committee.'' Tower's designated spokesman, attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, did not answer a reporter's calls Saturday. In written testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel on Jan. 26, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he could `` recall no actions in connection with any defense activities'' in connection with his work for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That statement, according to two publications, The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, did not square with information which Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in June of 1987 In the divorce deposition, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he went to work for British Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. Tower told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations. He said he earned $ 265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December. The Legal Times said <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, and that he listed the various weapons involved. The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. It said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> apparently has not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower. The Post, citing syndicated columnist <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>, said the incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair. When firemen broke into his room to remove him, `` he was reportedly in no condition to free himself,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and, two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, son of the late Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, on his way home from work. The youth was not seriously hurt. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> refused comment on specifics of the Tower investigation, but said `` We will follow any lead.'' On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I have never seen drinking being a factor in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s life other than a social glass of wine.'' <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was `` no question'' that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said: `` He is not an alcoholic. He's not had a drinking problem for years.''

<HEAD>Return of Kuwaiti Tankers Faces Possible Legal Hitch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` tentatively approved'' de-flagging six <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers, but the deal depends on the ships remaining available to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a national emergency, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday. The six ships are among 11 Kuwaiti tankers re-registered in July 1987 by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, entitling them to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protection as they carried Kuwaiti petroleum exports through the war-torn <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, then in the seventh year of its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, targeted <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> ships because the Arab state supported <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Hostilities halted Aug. 20 when a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect. The Pentagon announced Jan. 11 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was preparing to de-flag six of the Kuwaiti tankers. It said the other five had been certified to continue flying the Stars and Stripes for another year. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, a public affairs officer at the Maritime Administration, said in a telephone interview the agency gave its `` tentative approval'' Feb. 7 for the six tankers to revert to Kuwaiti registry. But he said it was unclear how <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> viewed the legal requirement that its ships remain available to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for possible use in a national crisis. `` Whether such a condition would be regarded by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> as impinging on its sovereignty, only the Kuwaitis could answer,'' he said. Kuwaiti officials were not available immediately for comment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law stipulates the `` emergency availability'' as a condition for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to approve the sale or re-registry of American-owned and American-flagged commercial ships abroad. Another official, who requested anonymity, said it was not known whether the Kuwaitis were aware of the provision, or whether it would have made any difference at the time. Gulf-based shipping observers said another unknown factor was what practical value the huge tankers might have for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One possible use might be storage. Technically, the 11 ships belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, a firm <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> set up in 1987 to provide ostensible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ownership. The ships' return to state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> apparently would be only a paper transfer, not a sale. The de-flagging is the latest move by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to scale down its military role in the gulf, reflecting what officials say are reduced tensions since the truce. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tripled the strength of its force in the gulf as the ` tanker war'' worsened in 1987. Now it has trimmed that force from 27 to 23 ships and no longer escorts tankers. The six being de-flagged include the 294,739-ton <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and 290,085-ton <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, both products carriers, and four identical, 46,723-ton liquified gas carriers. Sources close to the Kuwaiti owners said the two large tankers no longer meet <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> safety rules and the gas carriers were included because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have enough merchant seamen qualified to serve on them. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has to replace its ships' non-U.S. crews with all-American crews if they fly the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag _ a legal provision waived at the time of the re-flagging.

 The path taken by the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> to her historic consecration Saturday as Episcopal bishop took her to prisons, corporate board rooms, divorce court and the editorial desk of a feisty, liberal publication. Because that path did not include a college or seminary degree and because of what some view as her extreme left-wing views _ to say nothing of her gender _ <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration touched off heated debate in religious circles. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 58, became the first woman to become a bishop in any branch of Christianity that traces its bishops in a direct line 2,000 years back to the time of Christ. In an elaborate ceremony Saturday, she was consecrated suffragan, or assistant, bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> diocese. The issue of a woman assuming the miter and scepter of a bishop would engender debate throughout christiandom regardless of the nominee. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> provoked all the more discussion because of her background. Some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as well as her sex, says <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who is black. In the end her support was just as vocal and greater in quantity than the opposition. `` I think the time is right for it,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said recently. `` And I hope that we will soon see other women being elected and consecrated as bishops.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has been involved in chuch activities throughout her life. Following the example of her mother <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, who attended the consecration, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> sang in church choirs and taught in church schools at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barnabus </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. During the 1960s <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became involved in the civil rights movement and participated in the <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, march led by the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. For a decade beginning in 1958, she worked in a public relations firm and, beginning in 1968, she worked for <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations department, ending her career there in 1980 as a senior staff consultant That same year <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> assumed the robes of an Episcopal priest and began a career that took her to counseling sessions in state prisons and sermons in a city parish. In 1984, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an organization not officially sanctioned by the church but one with a considerable voice through its publication, The Witness. It was in the pages of this monthly magazine that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became known to a wider audience through her regular editorials. She wrote in opposition to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policies and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. She wrote in favor of gay rights and of an end to church discrimination against homosexuals and she lambasted conservative wings of the church on numerous occasions, sometimes angering as much with her style as with the substance of her commentary. In 1963, after three years of marriage, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> divorced <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, which also was cited by some critics. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has moved into an apartment in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> temporarily until her permanent assignment within the eastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> diocese is established. Her family has lived in the same home in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for 70 years so the move is a jolt for her. She likes classical music and drinks an occasional glass of chablis. She prefers `` any kind of gourmet food,'' but she also likes soul food, especially black-eyed peas. `` I like cooking up a storm for a large crowd,'' she said.

 Two of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists whose freedom is a key demand of a group holding American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have been released from prison after serving five-year terms, the interior minister said Saturday. The 17 were convicted in 1984 of bombing the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and American embassies and given sentences ranging from five years to death. The Islamic Jihad, which holds two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages, has demanded freedom for all 17. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused. Interior Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> said the two freed men, <PERSON> Abdul-Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashash </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, 25, an Iraqi, and 30-year-old <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Matar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahash </PERSON>, whose family lives in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> without official citizenship, were released `` a while ago, having completed their prison terms.'' The two are not considered key figures in the long-running hostage drama. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> did not say what date they were freed or where they are now. But <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s information minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in December the pair would be freed after they finished their sentences and would be deported to the country of their choice. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> stressed to reporters the release `` has nothing to do with the demands of extremist organizations.'' Despite recent speculation that some of the 15 hostages, who include nine Americans, might soon be freed, informed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said there was no sign any were about to be released. Most of the Lebanese captives are held by Shiite extremists. Islamic Jihad, believed made up of Shiite Moslem extremists loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, kidnapped <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on March 16, 1985, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> on June 9 the same year. The group has released four other Americans. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had no comment on the terrorists' release. The 17 bombers _ Kuwaitis, Iraqis and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> _ were arrested and tried after the December 1983 bombings of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies and <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government installations. Three were sentenced to death but have not been executed, and 12 were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 years to life. The two released were handed the shortest sentences and are not believed central to Islamic Jihad's demand for the release of the 17. Among the bombers sentenced to death is <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Badreddin </PERSON>, a cousin and brother-in-law of <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, said to be the leader of <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>. He was convicted under the alias of <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saab </PERSON>. One of those serving life is <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Musawi </PERSON>, a cousin of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musawi </PERSON>, leader of another Iranian-linked Shiite faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Since their 1984 trial, extremists have hijacked two <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> airliners to press for the release of their comrades. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused to negotiate. In December 1984, a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane was seized on a flight from <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and was flown to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The hijackers killed two American passengers and vanished after Iranian security men stormed the plane to end the six-day ordeal. A Kuwaiti <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was hijacked April 5, 1988 on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight. It was flown first to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where the hijackers killed two Kuwaiti hostages. The plane was later flown to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, where the 16-day saga ended with the hijackers freeing the hostages and the plane, apparently in return for safe conduct out of the country. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as one of four Lebanese Shiites who hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet in June 1985 and killed an American serviceman, is believed to have masterminded last year's <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had accused <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the Iran-Iraq war. Kuwaiti officials blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the 1983 bombings and other acts of sabotage in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. Relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> began improving last year after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has approved continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels resisting the Soviet-imposed government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, an administration spokesman said Saturday. Deputy press secretary <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided Friday to continue helping the rebels. `` The president met with his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` and reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy'' of continuing the flow of money, arms and supplies to the rebels so long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> keeps sending aid to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which initially reported the decision, quoted senior administration officials as saying that despite the continuing Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Soviets have left behind large amounts of military hardware and sent in new military equipment. It said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration decision, in effect, means that the political goal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> now that the Soviet troop withdrawal is virtually complete is to hasten the collapse of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent a relaxed day here Saturday, taking a stroll and greeting townspeople during a brief shopping trip. Wearing a heavy-duty naval flyer hat with flaps and carrying a walking stick, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked through the town square, stopping briefly chat with people and poking his stick in the air to make points. The first couple braved temperatures in the 20s for the midday outing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, appeared in the business district of this seacoast town around lunchtime, midway through a quiet weekend of relaxation at their <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point estate. While Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held their dog, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, on a leash, the president went into Colonial Pharmacy for a few moments. Asked what he'd bought, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> waved a paper bag and said, `` A few razor blades. `` Thank you. What a welcome!'' he said just before jumping into a beige van for the short ride back to his vacation retreat. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had attended to routine paperwork in the morning and had made some phone calls. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not take any questions from reporters during his walk through town, and press aides declined to discuss a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report saying that former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> had made conflicting statements about the nature of his role as a consultant to British Aerospace. The newspaper said that Tower had told a congressional committee that he had given non-military advice to British Aerospace, although he had said in a divorce deposition that he did consult the firm on military-related matters. `` We have no knowledge on that,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` It's before the committee.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked to respond to criticism by congressional Democrats about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failure to specify federal programs that will have to be cut in fiscal 1990, said only that he had talked to the president Saturday. `` He said he's still very pleased with the reaction to the budget,'' the press secretary said. Asked if he would quarrel with assertions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> failed to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> where he would cut the budget, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` Dispute it? We're bragging about it. That's what he wants to do, get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to help in cutting the budget.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday proposed a $ 1.16 trillion budget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. The document proposes several changes to the budget that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9 _ changes which principally reflected priorities that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laid out during his campaign, such as more spending on education, environmental issues and such social problems as AIDS and the homeless. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has agreed `` to sit down'' with administration officials to work on a budget compromise. `` We want to work out a budget,'' the spokesman said. `` We're not going to speculate on courses of action. ... We want to work it out the way it should be worked out, which is to sit down with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

 A comatose woman on Saturday underwent an abortion ordered by her husband in hopes of saving her life, ending a two-week legal fight with anti-abortionists that reached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go on with my life,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said shortly after his wife's abortion `` No other family should ever have to go through what we have gone through.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, remained comatose and was listed in guarded condition after the abortion but her vital signs were stable, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. A team of doctors, including an expert on second-trimester abortions, handled the procedure, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was 18 weeks pregnant. `` We have one other hurdle to overcome, and that is <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s recovery,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said `` I will live with this decision, but the decision had to be mine.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> has been in a coma at the hospital since a Dec. 13 car accident. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said doctors told him that terminating his wife's pregnancy could give her a better chance of recovering, so he asked a judge on Jan. 26 to declare him her legal guardian so he could authorize the abortion. Although a judge granted <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s request, the ruling was challenged by right-to-life advocates who appealed the decision at each court level until <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> rejected their stay request Friday. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, quickly approved the abortion and the procedure was completed Saturday morning. Although medical experts testified on <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s behalf that the abortion could help his wife's recovery, Ms. <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> said it was unclear what effect the abortion would have on Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. The two anti-abortionists, who had sought to be named Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s guardian themselves, said an abortion would threaten her emotional well-being. Abortions have been performed before on comatose pregnant women, but never involving the same type of injury or coma, Ms. <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> said. `` This is not only landmark legal terrain but also medical. There's nothing in the medical literature like this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hauptman </PERSON> said. The operation ended two weeks of strain for <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> and his family. `` We are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the operation went smoothly,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s mother. `` Now we are hopeful that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s condition will improve and that we can move on to therapy for her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> added. She and her husband visit their daughter daily at the hospital. Pro-choice advocate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said the case was not about abortion rights. `` This was an issue of husband and family rights, not abortion,'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said. `` It's a pity this family had to go through the pain and the suffering.'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> sue anti-abortion activists <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syosset </LOCATION> for the anguish their extended legal efforts caused, but <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said it was too soon to consider such a case. `` This is the most tragic thing that ever could have happened,'' <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said Saturday afternoon. `` We tried very hard up to the last second. We had a person standing on a phone at the hospital and one standing at a phone in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but we could n't do it.'' Short vowed to work to persuade the full <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear the case in an effort to prevent such cases from happening again. A half-dozen activists supporting a woman's right to choose an abortion carried placards outside the hospital, including one that read: `` Right to Life _ Your name is a lie. You were willing to let <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> die.'' Several <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police cars were stationed at the hospital in case anti-abortion activists staged any protest, but none showed up.

 A bomb exploded on a bus in the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, killing 20 people and injuring several others, government-owned television said Saturday. The Doordarshan television network said the explosion Friday killed two people on the spot. The others died in hospitals, it said.

<TEXT>
 A crowd estimated at 3 to 4 million celebrated the Islamic revolution's 10th anniversary Saturday by taking to the streets for a rally and roaring `` Death To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' Men, women and children braved snow and icy winds whistling down from the <LOCATION> Alborz </LOCATION> mountains to attend the rally around the towering independence monument in Freedom Square. A 10-story-high portrait of Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> served as a backdrop. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told the revelers their nation is ready for relations with `` every country that does n't plot against us.'' But a resolution read aloud said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should never have ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and `` their godfather, the Great Satan,'' the Iranian epithet for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The rally and others across <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> marked the climax of 10 days of celebrations that began Feb. 1, the date in 1979 when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in triumph after 15 years in exile. Ten days later, the last government appointed by <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> collapsed. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolutionaries took power and proclaimed the Islamic republic. In November of that year, fundamentalists took over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and held 52 Americans hostage 444 days. The revolution has survived bloody internal strife, an eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the hostility of much of the world. Beneath the huge portrait of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> hoisted for the rally, a slogan in <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> and English said: `` The Victory of the Revolution Needs Safeguarding.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> did not attend the rally, which police estimated drew 3 to 4 million people. The 88-year-old leader reportedly is in poor health and rarely leaves his home in north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. He was represented by his son <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, who is emerging as an increasingly powerful political figure. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, speaking from a platform draped in blue and green streamers, said the turnout was proof of Iranians' faith in the revolution and `` a warning to the world oppressor powers who conspire against the revolution.'' `` Today our revolution is stronger than ever despite the many obstacles placed in its way during the first 10 years by the oppressor powers,'' he said. Cheerleader <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mozavardi </PERSON>, known to Iranians as `` the minister of slogans,'' whipped the masses into a frenzy by leading them in his deep baritone voice in shouting anti-American slogans. Iranians stabbed their fists in the air in time with their roaring chant of `` Marg Bar Amrika!'' or `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' The bearded <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, speaking in a flat, unemotional voice, said `` there may be differences of opinion and taste between individuals'' in the Iranian government, but denied there was a power struggle. Nonetheless, there have been clear signs of a split, particularly since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. One divisive issue is the campaign by Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the most powerful figure after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, to normalize <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with Western countries and end its self-imposed isolation. The differences were illustrated last week when Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Aakbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> criticized a two-day visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second-biggest arms supplier after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Instead of clasping the hands of such foreigners we should join hands with our people to get rid of foreigners,'' <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> said. At the rally, many women _ who stood separately from the men in accordance with religious code _ carried photographs of husbands or sons killed in the war. There were hundreds of war veterans in wheelchairs or on crutches, and one group was given a position of honor in front of the speaker's platform. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said that although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s postwar reconstruction will depend mainly on Iranians, `` we also need the cooperation of those countries which are not motivated by plots or conspiracies against us.'' The six wide avenues converging on Freedom Square were crammed with people after the rally, one of the biggest in the capital in recent years. Sixteen helicopters, including some identified by officials as Iranian-built Shabaviz craft, showered the crowds with flowers and revolutionary leaflets.

<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 fishermen headed out onto frozen <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> for the start of the sturgeon spearing season Saturday despite warnings that the ice was unsafe. Authorities used a helicopter and a small airplane Saturday to look for cracks. No emergencies were reported in the first hours after the season opened at dawn, the <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're just keeping our fingers crossed up here,'' said a dispatcher, who asked not to be identified. Signs posted along the west shore of the lake in the <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION> area warn that the ice is hazardous, and state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> officials warned early last week that conditions were unsafe on large areas of the lake. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesenberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Otter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said he had not seen conditions as bad since 1932. Anyone who ventured onto the ice in the <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION> area `` is crazy,'' he said. Hundreds of shanties, cars, trucks and snowmobiles were in place by Friday afternoon as fishermen prepared for the annual event, wardens from the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> said. Most of the fishermen were at the north end of the lake, near <LOCATION> Neenah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Menasha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where the ice was believed to be thicker than in the Oshkosh and Fond du Lac areas. As recently as two weeks ago, the lake had many open areas and authorities said at least a week of very cold weather was needed to make the ice safe. Fishermen were jubilant when below-zero temperatures hit the area last week and stayed for several days, but authorities said a swift <LOCATION> Fox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> current kept the ice from freezing uniformly and strong wind broke up the ice in many places. The DNR said any strong wind between now and March 1, when the spearing season ends, could cause the ice to break up, stranding fishermen, shanties and vehicles.

 Well-wishers filled a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> church Saturday to celebrate the consecration in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a female Episcopal bishop, the first woman elevated to that rank in the Anglican Communion.

The Bishop of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, the Right Rev. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, said Saturday that the consecration was a cause for sadness. `` We in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> can not at present receive her ministry as a bishop and so our fellowship, our communion with one another, is impaired; our unity is undermined,'' he said.

 Jewish settlers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> stormed into an Arab village Saturday, damaging some homes and later stopping police from detaining a suspect in the raid, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Israeli reports said. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislator warned that conditions in the occupied lands were ripe for producing a new Jewish underground aimed at terrorizing Palestinians, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Arab doctors said six Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers. Settlers from the Izhar settlement raided the nearby Arab village of <LOCATION> Burkin </LOCATION> to retaliate for a stone-throwing attack, the radio said. It gave no details on the stoning attack. The radio said the settlers smashed windows of a car on their way and damaged houses in the village. It did not say what weapons they carried or how they damaged the homes. Arab reports gave a similar account but also said the settlers beat an elderly woman. The army said it had no information on that incident. Later Saturday, <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON> settlers prevented police from detaining a suspect in the attack, the radio said. No details were given. Legislator <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> warned that conditions in the occupied lands were apt to produce a new Jewish underground like the settlers' group that waged a terrorist war against <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists in the early 1980s, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> security service to deploy agents in the territories to foil any such attempt, the radio said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, about 120 communists hoisted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and marched Saturday to celebrate the seventh anniversary of their party, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The march came on a day of more clashes in the occupied territories between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters. At least three Palestinians were wounded, hospital sources said. The march in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, attracted members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an Arab reporter said. The protesters were defying a ban imposed on their party by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. Their party mounted a similar march Friday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeit </LOCATION>. Later in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and wounded a two girls, ages 16 and 18, in the legs as the troops were dispersing stone-throwing protesters, doctors said. Despite the clashes, the commander of a paratrooper unit patrolling the streets of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said the city of 120,000 was unusually quiet. `` We came to a place considered to be a center of the uprising, and it's quiet. Of course, here and there we have stone-throwings or burning tires, but we can control and almost ignore that,'' Capt. <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Federman </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. In one of several other clashes reported Saturday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a 14-year-old Palestinian was shot in the pelvis in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. They also said three women from <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> _ ages 18, 30 and 45 _ were beaten by soldiers when the women tried to free an Arab detained by the army. The army said it was checking reports of injuries in Saturday's violence At least 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died since the revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation broke out in December 1987. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the territories from <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 More than 4,000 protesters Saturday heckled and jeered about 1,000 members of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as it began a two-day rally. Protesters gathered near a hall where delegates met for the party conference, and 1,000 police officers surrounded the building to keep the two sides apart, officials said. By mid-morning, delegates could no longer reach the hall because of the protests, police said. A police spokesman, <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stellke </PERSON>, said officers used spray-can irritants at one point to clear a path for delegates. He said police, fearing violence, later decided not to escort any more delegates to the hall. Police reported several scuffles and vandalism to cars. <PERSON> Stellke </PERSON> said party sympathizers beat one demonstrator as the protester, but there were no arrests. Demonstrators shouted `` Kick the Nazis out!'' and `` Keep the foreigners, force the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> out'' as delegates arrived early Saturday. One delegate responded: `` You could n't be helping us more. You're giving us great publicity. Another complained: `` This would n't happen in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>,'' the nation's conservative stronghold. The German <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s platform calls for expelling foreigners as a way to maintain a `` national German identity.'' The rally came two days after the West German government outlawed a neo-Nazi party and two weeks after ultra-right candidates were elected to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The democratic party has about 6,000 members, according to West German <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures. City officials had banned the rally, saying they feared violence. <PERSON> Rahden </PERSON> has a population of about 12,000 and is 37 miles south of the northern port city of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>. A regional court Friday struck down the ban and an appeals court upheld that ruling.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, his impeachment trial in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> near, has been on the road trying to rally support for what he concedes is a come-from-behind effort. `` I have an uphill battle, all the way ...,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> told listeners on a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> radio station talk show last week. `` It's going to be very difficult for me to extricate myself from this. History demands that I try.'' It was typical of the speaking appearances he's been making each week on radio shows and at churches, colleges and civil rights groups. With his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial expected to begin as early as mid-March, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 52, has been urging listeners to write their senators to express interest in his case and contribute to his legal defense fund. Although the judge is often warmly received, he has raised only $ 4,000. He unsuccessfully asked for government help for his defense expenses, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 2 million for `` a witch hunt'' or `` fishing expedition'' against him. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> became the first black federal judge from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when he was appointed by then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1979. He marked another, less happy first last August when he became the only person ever to be impeached after he was already cleared of similar charges in a criminal trial. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to impeach, or send the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for trial, was 413-3. He is accused of conspiring with a former friend, attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders, to reduce a sentence of two convicted racketeers, and of lying and fabricating his defense during his 1983 criminal trial. Though <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in that trial, Borders was convicted of bribery conspiracy in a separate trial. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> dealt <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> another setback by deciding his trial would be largely conducted by a 12-member special committee before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes on whether to convict. A two-thirds majority would result in <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' removal from the bench. On Friday, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> law professor, said he would file challenges to the Rules Committee decision along with motions to dismiss the 17 articles of impeachment. He contends that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is unconstitutionally being tried twice for the same case, because of the criminal trial. Supporters of the impeachment answer that just because a charge is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury's satisfaction does not mean that a judge is fit to stay on the bench. The defense also argues that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may be trying to influence judicial independence through coercion. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> says the racial question bears on his troubles, but is not the only cause. `` I'm not going to go up to the Beltway and say, ` Leave me alone because I'm black,''' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. But he usually adds: `` I do not believe I would be in this situation if I were not black.'' He says he was targeted by a federal sting operation in 1981 because of his liberal record on the bench, particularly his strong opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deportations of Haitian aliens. Judicial colleagues acted against him because he `` was n't a member of the club'' and because many of `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ideologues'' want to keep the minorities and women appointed during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration in check, he argued. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> called the overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote `` rank politics.'' Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Democrat and longtime political ally of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, said he voted for impeachment even though such a vote was unlikely to help him politically. He said he looked over the evidence carefully and felt he had no choice. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> pointed out, though, that the impeachment was more like an indictment and does n't mean he presumes <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is guilty. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> reflected that his place in the history of the civil rights movement would be determined by the trial's outcome. `` I may be considered a visionary, someone who fought the odds,'' he said. `` Or I could be remembered only for being removed from the bench.''

 Fans of <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> and the curious lined up to pay $ 180 for a postcard with his picture and signature on it and $ 3,500 a sculpture that once belonged to the late actor-director. `` I'm going to get something,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, 70, who cowered in a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> farmhouse in 1938 as the `` aliens'' in <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>' frighteningly realistic radio play `` War of the Worlds'' drew closer `` I want a piece of a man who gave us so many memories.'' More than 550 items from Welles' Hollywood estate went on the block at a three-day auction that began Friday at C.B. Charles Auction Galleries. `` <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> liked to surround himself with the finest of everything,'' said owner C.B. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who purchased the items last year from a longtime girlfriend of Welles for an undisclosed sum. `` There was only one <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>, and people are still fascinated by him,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> died Oct. 10, 1985, in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> of a heart attack after a long bout with diabetes. On Friday, a standing-room-only audience of more than 300 bid an autographed publicity photograph of Welles in the classic 1941 film `` Citizen Kane'' to $ 110. A book with a self-portrait caricature on the front page was snatched for $ 225, while a 17 -LCB- - inch bronze sculpture of a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> soldier on horseback sold for $ 3,500 A working pocket watch went for $ 260; a broken one went for $ 140; a French postcard with <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>' face on it, signed by <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> himself, went for $ 180. `` We really came here just for a glimpse of what <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> was like as a man,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Looking at what people own is such an insight into what they were really like.'' Welles directed or acted in more than 60 films and won an Oscar for screenwriting for `` Citizen Kane,'' loosely based on the life of newspaper tycoon <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>' parents were children when <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> fooled the nation with `` War of the Worlds,'' but the mystique of the event was still strong for her. `` It's part of American lore,'' said <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, 34. `` It will be a long time before we forget <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>.''

 Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a potential gold mine of historical data. Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the famous <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city about 450 miles south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. `` There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of them are showing,'' <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will know more when we dig them up.'' He said he expects the statues to represent leaders and deities from a 750-year period that ended about 500 B.C., shortly before the Persians conquered <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Displaying the find to President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Egyptologist </PERSON> <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> described it as `` the most important of the end of the 20th century.'' Notable from the first half of the century are the discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun across the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> in 1922; a fabulous golden trove found in the <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Tanis </LOCATION> in 1939; and a dismantled full-size boat found beside the 4,600-year-old pyriamid of Pharaoh <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> in 1954. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> discovery turned up by chance on Jan. 22 during routine cleaning of an area at the western end of the temple's Amenhophis III courtyard, rimmed by towering and majestic columns. Three of the five statues found so far have been identified, he said. One is an 8-foot quartzite statue of <PERSON> Pharaoh </PERSON> <PERSON> Amenhophis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1391-1353 B.C. and founded the existing <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>. The others are life-sized or larger. Another statue, 5 -LCB- - feet long and made of black diorite, depicts the cow-headed goddess <PERSON> Hathor </PERSON>, guardian of women, beauty and love The third identified statue, made of granite, is of General <PERSON> Haremhab </PERSON>, a soldier who usurped the Egyptian throne at the end of the 18th dynasty after <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON> and his caretaker <PERSON> Aya </PERSON> died. He said the Amenhophis III statue became visible as workers were cleaning. `` Nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so many tourists each day,'' <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> said. Until Friday, the cache remained covered and under guard. Antiquities officials debated whether excavating the relics would damage the fragile temple and jeopardize the stability of columns. <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, an island of stone beauty beside the Nile, is considered the most endangered monument in the <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> area, undermined by a rising water table and a river of sewage water flowing beneath it. During its construction, the temple underwent continual changes and additions, including changes ordered by <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> II and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great. After the reign of <PERSON> Amenhophis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s religion underwent major upheaval when his son and successor <PERSON> Akhenaten </PERSON> ordered that a new god, <PERSON> Aten </PERSON>, be given precedence over the existing array of deities. His agents hacked the name of <PERSON> Amun </PERSON>, the long-favored god of <LOCATION> Thebes </LOCATION>, from monuments throughout <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The new discoveries give evidence of the turbulence, as the name <PERSON> Amun </PERSON> was chiseled from <LOCATION> Amenhophis </LOCATION>'s statue. Egyptian officials said the cache surely will yield historical data from the period of religious frenzy and violence. Antiquities officials said the statues probably were hidden by temple priests. `` We can expect to find such caches from time to time,'' said <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, archaeological adviser to the culture minister and director of <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>. `` We think these objects were buried by priests trying to hide them during periods when strife was occurring throughout the country.''

<HEAD>Opposition Rally Demands Democracy From New Regime</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people marched peacefully on Saturday and demanded that the new regime postpone the May 1 elections so the opposition will have time to launch an effective campaign. `` The people demand an authentic democracy and not a mere facade,'' shouted <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the largest opposition group. The rally in downtown Ascuncion followed by nine days the coup led by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who toppled the government of former dictator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had ruled for nearly 35 years. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, promised democracy and called elections for May 1. But opposition leaders said the election has been called too soon. They argue that voter lists are outdated and that some groups never have been able to participate in elections. Opposition figures say the official <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has held power for 42 years, is too rich and well-entrenched to be effectively challenged at the polls on such short notice. Radio stations said the chanting, flag-waving crowd at the Plaza of the Heroes ranged from 50,000 to 60,000 people. Witnesses placed the number closer to 10,000. `` This is the first time since I was 16 years old that I've attended a political rally,'' said <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodado </PERSON> `` For the last 30 years, only they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- have been able to demonstrate. All we got were beatings.'' <PERSON> Atilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelos </PERSON>, a 42-year-old farmer, said he traveled from the city of <LOCATION> Colonel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION>, 87 miles east of the capital, to `` demonstrate that this new opening to democracy is for the benefit of all the people. We have to be a single family.'' Police under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> refused to authorize demonstrations that might be construed as anti-government, and violently broke up those that were held anyway. On Saturday, the few police that were present directed traffic. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' government authorized the rally, and one of the capital's two television stations broadcast it live. Vendors sold ice cream and soft drinks from hand carts. Official and unofficial delegations represented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. `` At this historic moment, we wish to express our hope that the <LOCATION> Paraguayan </LOCATION> people may find, though peaceful dialogue, the road to a new era of justice and liberty,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation said in a communique. The group included former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and the former ambassador to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The rally was staged by the National Accord, a loose grouping of four opposition parties of which <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> is president. He said he spoke Friday night with new Interior Minister <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, and would submit opposition demands in writing on Monday. In addition to the postponing elections, the opposition seeks changes in election laws that would permit several parties to unite behind a single candiate, which now is prohibited; and new voter lists to replace current `` fraudulent'' ones. Some marchers Saturday were skeptical of the new regime's response to their demands `` It's not convenient for the government to give the opposition time to organize,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a pretty 23-year-old secretary and student.

<HEAD>Government Criticizes Vatican Report On Racism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Saturday that a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> report condemning apartheid misrepresents <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial policies The Foreign Affairs Department, in a statement, said it had not received a copy of the full, 45-page <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> document released earlier in the day, but was issuing a preliminary response based on news reports. `` On the basis of what is known to us, -LRB- the document -RRB- misrepresents South African government policy, clearly restated by the newly elected leader of the governing party in his first parliamentary statement in that capacity last week,'' the department said. It referred to Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, recently elected to replace ailing President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech Wednesday, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> called for an end to white-minority domination and racial prejudice, although he reaffirmed the government's commitment to segregation and made no mention of establishing black voting rights. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> document called apartheid `` institutionalized racism ... justified by an ideology of the superiority of persons from European stock over those of African or Indian origin. `` Today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form'' of racism, the document said. `` Change is absolutely necessary and urgent.'' French Cardinal <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Etchegaray </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> commission that prepared the document, said he went last year to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where 5 million whites hold political power while 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The Foreign Affairs Department, without mentioning <PERSON> Etchegaray </PERSON>, said the government `` finds it regrettable that a statement has been made on such a complex and difficult issue without the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> leadership having been to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to assess for themselves the situation here. `` The department nevertheless appreciates the report's condemnation of violence and its advocacy of communication and consultation as a method of resolving problems,'' the government added The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> document, entitled `` The Church and Racism: Towards A More Fraternal Society,'' said racism should be combatted through nonviolent means. `` The application of legislative, disciplinary and administrative measures, or even appropriate external pressure, can be timely ... but without ... going so far as to replace violently one unjust situation with another injustice,'' it said. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has said conditions are not ripe for a papal visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, although his plane was forced to land there because of bad weather during a trip to other southern African nations last year. There have been unconfirmed reports in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the pope might visit in 1990.

<HEAD>Law Drafted to Protect Interests of Soviet Consumer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposed law published Saturday gives the often defenseless Soviet consumer some new rights in the marketplace, including the power to get defective mechandise repaired or replaced at no cost. Legal protection for consumers has been so ineffective in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that many national newspapers last year reported the `` sensation'' of <PERSON> Muscovite </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhov </PERSON>'s successful battle in court to get his money refunded for a faulty tape recorder, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. `` People in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> have long been awaiting the appearance of this legal act,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a commentary on the new law. The draft law, printed in the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, says Soviet enterprises and citizens `` who sell products of inadequate quality'' would bear legal responsibility. Shoddy goods must be exchanged or the purchase price refunded, unless additional legislation provides some other redress, the proposed law stipulates. Poor quality merchandise can be seized from a firm if a court agrees, says the proposed law, which was submitted for nationwide discussion by the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body. Delays in meeting contracts for furnishing goods or services, a chronic problem in the Soviet economy, can result in fines that the delinquent supplier must pay to the consumer, according to the law. The legislation is to be discussed nationally and presented along with citizens' recommendations to the Supreme Soviet parliament for consideration by April 15, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The consumer protection law is only one of a series of measures advanced under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to increase both the quantity and quality of goods available to Soviets. Because the importance of competition was traditionally scoffed at, many Soviet factories `` have monopolized the output of this or that product, and dictate their terms to the consumer,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the new law would change that by involving consumers, along with designers, production personnel, and government authorities, in setting standards for goods. Independent consumer associations are also authorized under the law.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, with the voices of dissidents overwhelmed by cheers from thousands of fellow Episcopalians, on Saturday became the first woman elevated to bishop in a 2,000-year succession dating back to the apostles. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was greeted with a roar of approval from about 8,000 people when she walked down the aisle for a consecration that has drawn world attention because of her gender, background and liberal views. She was faulted by a conservative church member who said in a brief speech that her elevation would be a sacrilege. But when the chief consecrator, the Most Rev. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, asked the congregation if it was their will that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> be ordained, they thundered out: `` That is our will.'' `` I will obey <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and serve in his name,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` Men and women now stand together before God, in today's world, a world that needs that,'' First Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Episcopal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> said before the consecration, held in a convention center to accommodate the crowd. Beginning with a solemn procession and culminating in the laying on of bishops' hands and the placing of a pointed bishop's miter on her head, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> assumed the relatively minor position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> diocese. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said after her consecration that it put `` a tremendous amount of responsibility'' on her shoulders. `` That responsibility includes encouraging young people to press on and overcome barriers and to hang in there,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, adding that she intended to do just that. After the ceremony, she said she would try to reach out to her opponents and others to try to allay their fears. `` We will be in contact. We will do that to the best of our abilities,'' she said. `` Just say I'm very proud and very happy. That's all,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. The 58-year-old former publisher of a liberal Episcopal publication is the first woman consecrated a bishop in any of the three major branches of Christianity _ Roman Catholicism, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodoxy </ORGANIZATION> and Anglicanism, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ that consider bishops successors to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' apostles. Her selection touched off months-long debate within the church. Opponents included traditionalists who believe that because the apostles were men, the position of bishop must be reserved for men. Others objected to <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> because of her lack of a college degree and formal seminary training and because of her relative inexperience in parish ministerial work. Still others objected to her strongly liberal writings on gay rights, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and internal church matters. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who is black, said she believes that some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as well as her sex. But by last month her election was confirmed by a majority 118 Episcopal dioceses across the country. As a result of the intense debate, Saturday's rites drew network television coverage and a live local television audience. During a period in the ceremony allotted for protest, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, chairman of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chapter, appealed to <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, presiding bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, please weigh the consequences. By proceeding with this pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious imposture, you will abandon the communion of all those churches descended from the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and you will destroy the concept of legality in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> received a standing ovation after saying that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration was in accordance with church laws A 1976 vote by <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> bishops cleared the way for Saturday's consecration by approving the ordination of women as priests <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became a priest in 1980, one of about 1,200 women ordained. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' election last September by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> diocese also touched off debate from other denominations that bar women from the priesthood. Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archdiocese declined an invitation to attend the ceremony and said in a statement that the consecration of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> `` has serious ecumenical implications because it departs from a common tradition in regard to sacramental orders.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, an offshoot of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, was established in 1784 following the Revolutionary War. It is one of 27 member churches of the Anglican Communion grouped under, though not governed by, the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, leader of the worldwide <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION> and spiritual head of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> _ which bars ordination of women _ wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday to say he would pray for the church. `` We are deeply conscious that not every Anglican will yet feel able to acknowledge her as a bishop of the church,'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said in his message, which was released to the press in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Other Anglicans in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> held prayer services of support Saturday and two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> came to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to present <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> with letters of support. The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> broke with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in 1534 during the reign of King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>. Despite the break, Anglicanism, and later the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, maintained many Roman Catholic rites and traditions, including the concept of a direct succession of bishop dating back to the apostles. The word Episcopal itself refers to a church governed by bishops rather than a pope or central archbishop. A 1985 survey counted 7,858 parishes and some 2.9 million members. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s diocese is among the larger in the nation with 190 parishes and 96,000 members in the eastern half of the state.

 The proliferation of harbor dinner cruises, overnight fishing trips, whale-watching excursions, `` booze cruises'' and commuter ferries _ coupled with a series of accidents _ has led the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to propose new safety standards for small passenger vessels. Written after a 1951 charter boat collision off <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> left 56 dead, the small passenger safety law has remained largely unchanged since 1963 while a multitude of new uses has sprung up, says <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>. The boats, defined as carrying more than six passengers and displacing less than 100 gross tons, used to be predominately for day fishing trips and small ferry boats. Most of today's vessels are much bigger than the boats of the 1950s and 1960s and often are carry hundreds _ and in several cases thousands _ of passengers, <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> said. Uses include high-speed passenger ferries, harbor taxies, dinner cruises, whale-watching and other tour boats, the popular `` booze cruise'' floating parties and chartered fishing trips that extend for days at a time. Ocean liners, large ferry boats and other vessels more than 100 gross tons fall under separate rules and already face tougher safety standards. Proposed new requirements include improved life-saving equipment, radar and electronic position-fixing equipment for certain new vessels as well as public address systems for all new vessels and existing vessels with more than one passenger deck. Emergency lighting on vessels more than 65 feet, fire extinguishing systems for enclosed machinery spaces, fire pumps capable of remote operation, smoke detectors on certain vessels, passenger manifests and mandatory public safety announcements are also on the list. In addition, wooden boats or vessels operating in salt water would have to go into drydock every two years for repairs and inspection. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has long pushed for an overhaul of the small passenger vessel regulations. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed rules `` certainly go in the right direction. `` The board has felt and recommended for some time that the changes are needed because the old rules are inadequate,'' he said. `` Whether the new rules go as far as the board would like we'll only know after an evaluation, which has just begun.'' Industry representatives said they too are still analyzing the proposals and their potential impact. `` As businessmen they're pro-safety, but I do n't think they've been able to assess what the government regulations will mean to them individually,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauridsen </PERSON>, a technical consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vessel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> The proposals would cost the industry about $ 8.5 million a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimate. Released Jan. 30, they are subject to 120 days of public comments. <PERSON> Cumins </PERSON> said he does not expect the final rules to be adopted until mid-1990.

<TEXT>
 The leader of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist rebel movement says in an article released Saturday his group is far more moderate than is widely believed and seeks a new system that is `` open, flexible, pluralistic and democratic.'' <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the revolutionary government he is fighting for `` should avoid confrontation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' because <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s ties to it are stronger than those his country has elsewhere. <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> outlined his views in an article in Foreign Policy magazine, which described it as his first comprehensive statement for an English-language publication. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration spent an average of well over $ 100 million a year in military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to prevent a takeover of that country by <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> and his followers, seeing them as intent on establishing a Marxist state with strong ties to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The prevailing view in administration has been that the Salvadoran rebels are far more radical than the insurgency in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> which seized power nine years ago. But <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> wrote that `` it is neither possible nor necessary'' in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to `` eliminate totally'' the private sector, establish a single-party system, bar other parties from the media, break with the church or eliminate elections. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, `` pursues an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that is open, flexible, pluralistic and democratic in both the economic and political spheres.'' With presidential elections set for next month, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is entering a crucial stage. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> recently moved away from its support of a peaceful settlement based on power sharing to one of support, under certain conditions, for the existing electoral process. Although no agreement has been reached with the govenrment, <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> called the proposal `` a final effort to avoid a social explosion.'' Rejecting the Cuban model, which emphasizes total state control over the economy, <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said a `` combination of the private and public sectors can lead to more rapid development of Salvadoran society than a supposedly more radical and closed model.'' Further emphasizing his preference for pragmatic policies, <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said `` an ideological approach is of no use if it does not resolve the problems of poverty. But <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> can not develop if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not understand its situation and drives it to develop a war economy.'' He also called for freedom of expression. `` Through debate and education, the masses can learn why they should defend their historic achievement, the revolution itself,'' he said. `` But this knowledge can not be developed without opposition, without an understanding of the opposition's point of view.'' He added that to promote debate, `` professional journalism that is both independent and critical is fundamental.'' There was no immediate comment by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>' article but shortly before returning to private life last month, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said he expected that the Salvadoran rebels would expand efforts to influence public opinion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was able to influence <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to suspend aid to the Contra rebels and he predicted a similar attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> to persuade the lawmakers to reduce aid to the Salvadoran government. A recent <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said there has been a steady increase in <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> `` assassinations, kidnapings, use of pressure-detonated mines that kill and maim indiscriminately.'' It said that guerrilla mines killed 39 people and injured more than 130 in the first nine months of 1988.

<TEXT>
 Food-poisoning scares involving chicken, eggs, butter and popular precooked dinners have left millions of Britons baffled and preoccupied with what they can and can not eat. Since December, when a government health minister said most of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s egg production was infected with salmonella, the debate over the risk of eating various foods has gained momentum. Public anxiety has been aroused partly by news media attention and front-page headlines, such as `` Cheese Can Kill Your Baby'' in Saturday's tabloid The Sun, and partly by confusing data from officials. `` The average consumer is punch-drunk with warnings and statistics _ many of which seem contradictory,'' said the normally pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. During the weekend, Britons faced a triple food scare: salmonella-infected chickens and eggs; mercury-contaminated butter; and soft cheeses, precooked meals, and fresh fruits and vegetables contaminated by listeria bacteria. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday denied a front-page story in the liberal Guardian newspaper that claimed the government was delaying publication of a report into another scare _ the possibility that meat products from cattle infected with a brain virus could trigger the same disease in humans. The report will be published soon and there is no health risk because milk and meat from such animals is being destroyed, the government said. With public concern mounting, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government announced Friday a committee to investigate all aspects of food safety The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ordered farmers to slaughter all salmonella-infected chickens. The disease can be fatal to the elderly and very young. Also Friday, the government's chief medical officer, Sir <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON>, warned pregnant women not to eat soft cheeses, which could be contaminated by listeria bacteria, and urged that precooked meals be reheated to prevent listeria contamination. A <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday that a ban would be imposed on unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization kills some bacteria and delays the development of others. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest butter producer, called in police and recalled all Cornish-brand butter after a container was found to be contaminated by mercury. The company said Saturday there was no risk of harm to humans. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s health spokesman, welcomed formation of the investigative committee and <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON>'s recommendations but said: `` I would be more impressed if the guidance to the public was accompanied by regulations on the food industry, to get at the root of the problem. Even the prime minister's staunchest newspaper supporters expressed doubt the government's actions would quell public anxiety. `` The problem, which the spate of recent food scandals has brought into focus, is the tendency of government departments to mirror producer interests at the public expense,'' the pro-Thatcher <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial Saturday. The Financial Times, the respected conservative financial daily, echoed this assessment, saying the government had been `` inept'' and unable to reconcile the interests of egg producers, represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, with those of consumers who ended up with no voice. `` What we need,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said, `` is a separate <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- government -RRB- department corresponding to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to safeguard the people against the farmers', wholesalers' and retailers' failures and sins.'' But <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday that the public's demand for inexpensive, mass-produced food had led to the current health scares. `` The truth is that the severe outbreak of salmonella poisoning ... is caused by our demand for cheap eggs. If we want cheap eggs, we will get mass production, by methods that must heighten the risk of disease; if we want safe eggs, we must be prepared to pay more. As with eggs, so with chickens,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Men Convicted In Slaying Of Teen-Ager Suspected Wrongly Of Rape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two men have been convicted in the 1987 slaying of a teen-ager who they mistakenly accused of raping the 80-year-old grandmother of one of the men. A <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury deliberated less than 40 minutes Friday before convicting <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> of murder in the Nov. 27, 1987, shooting of <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelle </PERSON>, who died eight days later. `` It's a shame, because he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Donnelle </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was n't guilty,'' said <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in closing arguments. `` This 17-year-old kid absolutely died for nothing.'' After <PERSON> Donnelle </PERSON>'s death, police determined his blood type did not match the blood type of the person who raped the elderly woman. No one has been charged in the rape. The jury will return Monday to set punishment for <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, 36, of nearby <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. They face sentences of five to 99 years or life in prison. During the three-day trial, witnesses testified that <PERSON> Donnelle </PERSON> was killed because the two defendants were under the impression that <PERSON> Donnelle </PERSON> had raped <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>'s grandmother. A stepdaughter of <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> testified that the 80-year-old woman had identified <PERSON> Donnelle </PERSON> as her attacker from a television news report and a photograph. Defense attorneys argued unsuccessfully that prosecution witnesses were doing the same thing that the two men had done _ mistakenly identifying them as killers. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the same case.

<HEAD>Peasants March In Capital To Support Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 12,000 peasants and farm workers marched through the capital on Saturday to defend the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government's land reform program. The peaceful rally was staged by the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmworkers </ORGANIZATION>. The group has warned against erosion of the gains made during the 9-year-old land reform program, which redistributed nearly a third of the tiny Central American nation's arable land. Presidential elections are scheduled March 19 and the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win. Some <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and leftists fear the rightists may try to overturn the land reform program, though the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> denies such intentions. Also Saturday, about 1,000 people in the eastern provincial capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> marched in support of the mayor, who like his counterparts has been threatened with death by leftist guerrillas fighting the U.S.-backed government. The mayor, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, said he would not resign as have 90 of the country's 262 mayors. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla army, since early 1988 has waged an intimidation campaign against municipal authorities. The rebels have assassinated nine mayors. The insurgents accuse municipal authorities of helping to implement what they call `` the U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency project.'' The resignation of more than a third of the country's mayors has created administrative problems. A substitute, usually from the municipal council, carries out some mayoral functions in most cases, but some towns have been left virtually without municipal authority.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Saturday urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to abide by whatever decisions the Central American presidents reach during their upcoming summit. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told a news conference that the summit that begins Monday will help revive the dormant Central American peace plan. `` We can assert that the plan is not dead ... but instead that it is being strengthened by the will of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I hope President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> respects the decisions that we Central American presidents reach'' at the summit, he said. The summit of the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is to be held in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he will propose: _ A plan under which <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can jointly fight the illegal drug trade. `` Drugs are produced by the south, consumed by the north, and in their transit they go through <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. _ Suggest having international observers `` from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> ... and other countries'' to oversee elections. _ Discuss regional economic subjects. `` The Central American region demands economic backing without discrimination of any sort.'' _ Pursue a proposal he has given <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> to repatriate Nicaraguan Contra rebels and their relatives who are in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` This effort could be supported by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The summit was supposed to take place in August and had been postponed at least five times. The leaders are to meet under a plan they signed in August 1987 designed to bring peace to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last February stopped military aid to the Contras, who a month later signed a preliminary cease-fire with the Sandinista government. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have been extending the truce month by month and now only sporadic violations occur. Asked about reports that Contra leaders would be at the summit and would try to meet with the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the Contras `` have no place'' at a meeting of Central American presidents. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> added that `` the possibility exists'' that U.S.-Nicaraguan relations can return to normal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which had been aiding the Contras since 1981, imposed a trade embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1985. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is suffering from a serious economic crisis with rampant inflation and low productivity.

 Legal experts from the government and the opposition began working together Saturday on ways to reform <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s judicial system. Representatives of the banned trade union Solidarity plan to raise the issue of the need for a more independent judiciary, said historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, an opposition figure. The talks are part of the historic negotiation session that began Monday between the government and the opposition, led by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The talks are aimed at reforming the political, social and economic framework of the country. Small groups have been set up to address individual issues. The full negotiations are expected to last four to six weeks. Meanwhile, a strike over pay by transport workers in <LOCATION> Piotrkow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trybunalski </LOCATION>, a central Polish provincial city of 80,000 people, continued Saturday, Polish television said. The strike began Friday and is backed by the official trade union OPZZ.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has warned the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> against attacking <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military or civilian targets, but is not ready to break off talks with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group over a clash in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Saturday. Launching a weeklong trip to 14 West European capitals, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had not decided whether an incident a week ago means the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has reneged on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s pledge renouncing terrorism. In the confrontation, Israeli forces intercepted and killed five guerillas who were carrying identification papers linking them to two factions of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The pledge and the statement by the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader accepting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist prompted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration last December to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after a 13-year official ban. `` We are not prepared at this time to say this constitutes action by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to cause us to break off the dialogue,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on a flight from <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where he opened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consultations with <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> members on Friday. But, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, had informed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials there that the clash last weekend was the kind of action `` that presents us with great difficulty.'' In fact, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` We made the point that actions such as this _ directed against civilians or military targets, inside or outside of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ were something that gave us trouble.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> boosted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s standing in the international community. Since then, he has gained increased support from West European governments. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, meanwhile, sharply disagreed with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision. After the clash, Israeli leaders said the five guerillas _ four Palestinians and a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> _ had tried to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to carry out a terrorist raid. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> complained to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and said the incident showed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not changed its tactics despite <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s pledge. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said terrorism was one of the issues he intended to discuss with the 14 foreign ministers he will see on his European tour. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he hoped to encourage `` a collective'' approach, but that he would not `` foreclose'' unilateral retaliation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bombed <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, in 1986 in what was described by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as retaliation for <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in a terrorist attack on a West German nightclub frequented by Americans. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met for nearly two hours in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> with Foreign Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannibalsson </PERSON>.

 The captain of a luxury liner that sliced a disabled Cuban freighter in two said Saturday his crew was not at fault in the pre-dawn collision that left three Cuban crewmen missing. The cruise ship Celebration arrived home in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Saturday as federal transportation officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and its insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, questioned the crew about the Friday morning collision off <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Despite an 18-inch gash and black scrape marks on its bow, the 734-foot cruise ship sustained only minor damage, and none of its 1,500 passengers or 600 crewmembers was injured, a Carnival Cruise Lines spokesman said. Capt. <PERSON> Rafaele </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravino </PERSON>, master of the Celebration, said the 350-foot Cuban vessel, the <LOCATION> Capitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION>, was drifting without lights or steering in a major shipping channel and made no effort to warn his crew of the impending collision. `` The fault is with the ship that had no lights,'' said <PERSON> Gravino </PERSON>. But the helmsman of the Cuban vessel said Saturday his captain tried to warn the Celebration and maneuver to avoid the accident, reported <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s official news agency. `` We signaled the other ship to let us maneuver and tried to change course to avoid an accident,'' said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahera </PERSON>, whose right leg was amputated after the collision. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lahera </PERSON> remains hospitalized in <LOCATION> Holguin </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and the search continues for the captain and two other lost crewmen. <PERSON> Gravino </PERSON> also said his crew was not to be blamed for failing to check radar for 27 minutes prior to the accident. `` When there is no visibility, the radar is checked very frequently. But when there is good visibility, you are supposed to see the lights of the other ship,'' <PERSON> Gravino </PERSON> said during a news conference aboard the ship. His crew did n't see the cement hauler until they were 300 feet apart, he said. His officers threw the engines into reverse, but it was too late to avoid slamming into the disabled freighter. The Cuban crew told their rescuers that the freighter had lost electrical power. But Carnival spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said they still could have warned passing ships of its plight. `` When you do not have emergency lights, you can still raise oil lamps, use the radio or shoot flare guns,'' he said. <PERSON> Gravino </PERSON> quickly left the news conference to meet with investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has conducted a series of hearings in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on cruise line safety. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were looking into the incident even though it involved a Liberian-registered cruise liner and a Cuban freighter en route from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. A crew from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s marine safety office judged the vessel to be seaworthy and it set sail Saturday afternoon on another weeklong trip to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. The Celebration's crew rescued 42 of the 45 Cuban crew members, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The surviving sailors were picked up by a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> navy frigate and tug and 13 were hospitalized in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> reported. The three missing men included the ship's captain, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazco </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, 34, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> los </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyre </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 40, all of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, the news agency reported.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday to delay former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial, citing a danger he would divulge too many national security secrets `` Proceeding with the trial on those terms will make it impossible for the attorney general to fulfill his responsibility to safeguard classified information,'' the department said in asking for a stay. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reject the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request, saying the department has no legal authority to seek a delay. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the attorney general `` comes before this court in an attempt to assume a role that the Ethics in Government Act and his own Independent Counsel Regulation deny him: that of prosecutor in this case.'' The independent counsel called the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request an `` eleventh-hour application'' and said the department `` has sought to interfere in this trial at the final hour.'' A jury was chosen Thursday in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial on 12 felony charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has asked the jurors to report to the courtroom Monday. It was not clear when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was likely to act on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after a three-judge federal appeals panel on Friday _ for the second time in as many days _ refused to delay the start of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. Department officials say that if the delay is denied, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is prepared to act under the Classified Information Procedures Act to file an affidavit objecting to disclosure by North of some classified information. That step could result in dismissal of some or all criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION>, once the attorney general files an affidavit, the court must order North not to disclose the classified information at issue, even though it is relevant material tending to prove his innocence. Dismissal of charges likely would follow on grounds that <PERSON> North </PERSON> would not be given a fair trial. The department criticized the judge in the case for not reining in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s plans to use extensive amounts of classified material. `` No order of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> prohibits defendant <PERSON> North </PERSON>, in his opening statement or during the government's case, from simply disclosing, without seeking prior court approval, classified information that falls outside'' eight categories identified by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> last Wednesday, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s 19-page court filing. `` Even as to information within those categories, no order prohibits defendant North from disclosing classified information during his own case,'' it added. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued orders Dec. 12 and Jan. 19 spelling out how much censorship could be applied to classified material that the prosecution and defense planned to use at trial. `` The categories of information covered by the two orders were by no means exhaustive,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Much classified information remained unprotected and was not the subject of any pretrial ruling on admissibility.'' The department wants to delay the trial so additional steps can be taken to bar North from disclosing classified material. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> disagreed with the department's assessment, saying he believes that `` all areas of concern to the intelligence agencies have been adequately covered by the district court's orders.'' The independent counsel said that during seven months of <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> proceedings he has asked intelligence agencies to enumerate which specific classified information could never be disclosed at trial, and then took action accordingly to protect the secrets. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has largely cooperated with intelligence agencies in trying to resolve problems involving classified material. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> parted company so abruptly that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff reportedly had almost no warning that the department was going to court on its own. The problems began Jan. 19 when <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued an order that would permit North to introduce, without a prior court order, classified information tending to show that his intent was not to violate the law. Intelligence agencies were concerned over the freedom the order gave <PERSON> North </PERSON> to present a broad array of classified material. As an alternative, the government asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to require the defense to provide advance notice or get a court order before disclosing classified information. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected that proposal Jan. 30. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday asked for a court order barring disclosure of classified material as long as a government objection was pending. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, however, asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to impose no more than the restrictions that already apply to prosecutors.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The award-winning film `` Man Of Iron,'' which chronicled the birth of the Solidarity trade union movement, is being shown at a theater here for the first time since its official premiere in 1981. The film, which includes a cameo appearance by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, returned to view last week, the same week the government and the outlawed union began their historic talks on reforming <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Directed by <PERSON> Andrezj </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>, the movie was awarded the Grand Prix prize at the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and nominated for an Academy Award the same year. A product of the cultural explosion during the 1980-81 period in which the communist government approved Solidarity as the only legal independent union in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>, the film disappeared from theaters after the martial-law crackdown in December 1981. `` Man of Iron'' is playing three times daily in the Palace of Culture and Science, a Stalin-era structure that towers over central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` Man of Iron'' depicts the rise of Solidarity during a strike of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard workers led by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. It is a sequel to `` Man of Marble,'' which explored the tribulations of a bricklayer plucked from obscurity to be displayed as a model worker during the 1950s.

 More than 100 dissident parishioners took over <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday to begin a two-day vigil to protest the transfer of their popular Polish pastor. `` We're here to stay, day and night,'' <PERSON> Halina </PERSON> <PERSON> Chmiel </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the group, said as about 120 mostly Polish dissidents marched up the center aisle of the 89-year-old church just before the afternoon Mass. The protesters planned to stay for two days and two nights and some said they would go on a hunger strike, she said. The dispute centers on the replacing of the Rev. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Pysz </PERSON>, a popular pastor who was transferred to a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, parish in August, and associate pastor <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>. Church officials maintain <PERSON> Pysz </PERSON> went voluntarily to the Buffalo parish and was not removed, as some of the protesters contend. The protesters criticized the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON>, who was brought in to replace <PERSON> Pysz </PERSON>, for attempting to open the parish to other ethnic groups and allegedly verbally abusing the dissidents. The parish is in a mostly Hispanic neighborhood in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>'s East End. <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Saturday and unavailable for comment, church officials said, and telephone calls were not immediately answered. But he has said previously, `` as people get aroused, they're likely to do anything.'' `` The church is a place to pray, not to protest,'' said <PERSON> Casmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapolnik </PERSON>, an usher who said he's been a church member since coming from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> 25 years ago. As the procession moved down the center aisle behind a hand-painted banner that said `` Church Occupation'' in red letters, arguments broke out between the protesters and those who had gathered for Mass. Several police officers were dispatched to the church, but no arrests were made and there was no attempt to remove the protesters.

 Automobile giant <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> sold trucks to the military in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> without proper export permits, a news magazine reported Saturday. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON>, denied that export rules were broken, saying the trucks were `` multi-use vehicles'' not specifically designed for military purposes. However, he said they could be used by the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> military. <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> magazine said that <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> had sold <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> 237 trucks and 30 tractor-trailers from November 1986 through November 1987. The magazine said that customs officials in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> determined that the vehicles were shipped to the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> army without a required export license. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the shipments were not inspected by customs officials because they were registered as civilian vehicles. Customs officials later determined that the shipments were to be used for military purposes, the magazine said. <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON> said the company had complied with all export license requirements. `` These vehicles came out of mass production lines and can be used for all kinds of transport, including military,'' <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON> said in a radio interview. He said the company can not tell the buyers how to use the vehicles. In the radio interview, <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON> said he did not know whether the company had negotiated the sales directly with military officials in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But he confirmed as correct the number of vehicles mentioned in the Spiegel report. Export permits are required for the shipment of military equipment or hazardous materials to areas of tension. Stuttgart-based <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> is also a major exporter of luxury cars.

 The yacht Thursday's Child, zigzagging north against strong headwinds, should arrive in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Sunday to beat by eight days the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> speed record set 135 years ago, a spokeswoman said Saturday. `` It will be the early morning,'' said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON>, a shore-based spokeswoman for the three-man crew. `` They just want to get in.'' Since Nov. 23, the 10-ton racing yacht has logged some 15,000 miles in a voyage around dreaded <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> off the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The period included a stop at the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to make repairs after the boat collided with an unknown object. In the past seven years, five other racing boats have been sunk rounding <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> in futile attempts to beat the record set by the clipper ship Flying Cloud in 1854 _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 89 days, eight hours. Saturday afternoon, an airplane with an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter and photographer aboard spotted Thursday's Child about 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and 75 miles from the Golden Gate. The yacht was moving almost due north at 8 to 10 knots in about 15 knots of wind. The crew _ skipper-owner <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>, 44, <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, 54, who helped design the high-tech vessel _ were in for a welcome from hundreds of boats at the finish under the Golden Gate Bridge. The news earlier Saturday was not so good. Shifting winds had dropped to a slight breeze overnight as the boat struggled to progress north. At midnight, the boat was making only 7 -LCB- knots, less than 9 mph. Although tired from the constant tacking, which requires the crew to leap from one side of the cockpit to the other to manipulate the sail as the boat zigzags northward, the crew was well, <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> was. <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON>, talking over the radio one day last week, called the adventure `` some of the finest sailing I ever had. I would do it again at the drop of a hat.'' But it was with awe and respect for the power of the sea that he recalled the boat's navigation of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, which is always torn by roaring winds. ` It got pretty bad ... very unpleasant,'' <PERSON> Hazelton </PERSON> said. He said the vessel spent six days and nights sailing into the teeth of winds gusting to 60 knots, through seas that raged against the boat from all directions. The clipper Flying Cloud, a merchantman that also ferried Gold Rush adventurers to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, could lay on 35 sails on its tall masts. It was the fastest of thousands of sailing clippers that raced each other across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Ironically, the ship's record-setting performance in 1854 coincided with the beginning of the end of this country's sailing commerce. In that year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipbuilders quit clipper construction because freight rates had dropped and the oak that went into the ships became too expensive. Steam sealed the doom of the clippers. And the rocks off <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, did likewise to the Flying Cloud in 1874. Nothing is left of it.

 The crew of a F-4E fighter reported a possible hydraulic problem before smoke filled the cockpit and the pilot passed out, forcing another officer to make an emergency landing, officials said Saturday. Both men were ejected from the jet as it taxied down a runway Friday night at <LOCATION> Baer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, where their unit, the 122nd <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, is based. There had been initial reports that the plane crashed. The pilot later died; the cause of death was not immediately known, the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. An autopsy was performed Saturday, but the cause of death will not be released until the investigation is completed, said <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shaughnessy </PERSON>. `` The aircraft took off around 7:30 p.m. and reported a possible hydraulic pressure problem. Shortly thereafter, smoke was reported in the cockpit and then that the pilot was incapacitated for unknown reasons,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> statement read by Tactical Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Manier </PERSON>. It was not clear where the smoke originated or if there was a fire in the cockpit, as had been reported Friday after the incident. `` That has n't been confirmed,'' 1st Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Snider </PERSON> said of the fire possibility Saturday. `` It has been confirmed there was smoke in the cockpit.'' The Guard would not say how the unconscious pilot ejected or why the men ejected while the plane was taxiing. On Friday, control tower supervisor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said the plane crashed. But Guard officials Saturday said the plane skidded several thousand feet and stopped in the grass next to the runway. After the pilot, 1st Lt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, 26, passed out, the only other person aboard, weapons officer Maj. <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, made an emergency landing under the escort of another jet, the Guard said. `` He was n't trained to fly the airplane,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clevenger </PERSON> said. `` It's -LRB- landing the aircaft -RRB- not an easy thing to do even if you had experience.'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> was treated at <LOCATION> Lutheran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and released, and returned to normal duty Saturday, the Guard said. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Lutheran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after the landing, the Guard statement said. An autopsy was performed Saturday but the cause of his death was not immediately available, <PERSON> Manier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> was a full-time Guardsman, <PERSON> Manier </PERSON> said, and <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> `` is a traditional Guardsman, and as a civilian is self-employed.'' A board of officers was appointed to investigate the accident.

<TEXT>
 Party chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership has endorsed a multi-party system but would continue to reassess a key chapter in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s history, the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt The Central Committee, split between socialist hardliners and reformers, ended a special two-day session aimed primarily at assessing the emotionally and politically significant revolt. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who has said previously that a multi-party system in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is likely next year, told Hungarian radio that `` the party has taken a stand that it accepts, takes note of and endorses a multi-party system.'' But the length and secrecy of the meeting indicated the party was split over plans to share power with other parties and a host of other reforms. Fifteen of the alternative political movements founded in recent months said Monday they would not enter a coalition with the communists, as some <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reformers desire, unless the party revises its view of 1956. Earlier, party spokesman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> told Hungarian radio the `` various platforms'' within the 108-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` sought unity on the fundamental issues,'' indicating a split. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting was called after Politburo reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> shocked Hungarians by terming the 1956 revolt a `` popular uprising.'' It had been referred to for more than three decades years as a counterrevolution. A source insisting on anonymity said Saturday the party had compromised on a new official view of 1956. A Central Committee member, <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, hinted at a possible compromise Friday by saying the revolt may have started as a popular uprising but turned into `` something which could be termed a counterrevolution.'' But <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the party would continue to discuss the revolt. But he, too, suggested Saturday that it began not as a revolt against the socialist system but that `` counterrevolutionary forces'' were quick to profit from the rebellion. He admitted that `` in our assessment of 1956 in these decades, the role of counterrevolutionary forces played a leading part in our propaganda and we forgot the feeling of the population.'' The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with demands that Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. About 20,000 Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to quell the uprising on Nov. 4 and replaced the government. When he referred to the revolt as a popular uprising on Jan. 28, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said his reassessment was based on the report of a party commission investigating four decades of communist rule in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The report has not been published, but <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said Sunday it would be. He also said <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s comments were `` too hasty.'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s statement touched off unprecedented open debate and revealed the party split on the pace and extent of reforms. The state daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday two of the new groups, the New March Front and Smallholders' Party, already have held talks on setting up national organizations before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> legalizes alternative parties.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge threw out a $ 22.8 million judgment against the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, ruling that federal racketeering laws do not apply in the fraud case brought against the utility. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said the case, involving electricity rates, belonged before the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and should not have been brought to the federal court. He said he became convinced the case did not belong him while presiding over the jury trial in December. `` What the trial proved ... was that the -LRB- federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -RRB- can not, and should not, be applied in a case such as this to permit a federal jury in a civil case to second guess the rate-making authority of the state,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> has been pushing for a settlement of the civil racketeering suit brought against <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON>, a court-appointed mediator, said the ruling puts pressure on both sides to reach a settlement. Negotiators are scheduled to meet Monday. `` In light of the judge's ruling, it would be folly not to settle this case,'' he said. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said it would appeal <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s ruling. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were pleased. Last December, a jury found that the financially troubled utility had lied to state officials about the progress of the controversial <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant to obtain rate increases in 1978 and 1984. The jury awarded $ 22.8 million in damages to <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. That verdict opened <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to the risk of a class-action suit by <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> ratepayers, with damages against the utility potentially reaching billions of dollars, far beyond the net worth of the utility. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> had filed a motion before the start of the jury trial, asking <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> to decide that the matter was not an issue for the federal court under the RICO statute. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> reserved judgment on the request. Construction on the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, began in 1973 and was largely finished a decade later but has never been opened. Legal objections to the plant by both state and local governments and many <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents have pushed the cost of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> to $ 5.4 billion, more than 70 times the original estimate. The controversy has taken <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to the brink of bankruptcy several times.

 Anti-abortion protesters blocked entrances at medical clinics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Saturday in demonstrations that resulted in the arrests of dozens of people, officials said. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, more than 700 protesters on both sides of the abortion issue demonstrated outside two medical clinics; more than 40 abortion opponents were arrested in <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and 87 people were arrested when they blocked a women's clinic in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Abortion protest drew smaller crowds in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, where 16 demonstrators were arrested and cited, authorities said. In <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, police arrested and carried away some of the 350 people who blocked entrances to a medical clinic during a protest dedicated to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a comatose <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> woman who received an abortion Saturday morning in an attempt to help her recover. Anti-abortion activist had tried to stop her husband from becoming her guardian to authorize the procedure. Members from the <ORGANIZATION> Bi-State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> sat outside the clinic, sang religious hymns and hung on the building their trademark banner that reads, `` Killing Factory Closed.'' A <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION> police dispatcher said Saturday that 44 people were arrested and charged with trespassing. They were released on their own recognizance after agreeing not to return to the clinic until their cases were heard in municipal court, said the dispatcher, who refused to give her name. In <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, demonstrators blocking the entrance to an abortion clinic went limp when approached by officers, resulting in 87 trespass arrests, officials said. Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> said the demonstration was peaceful. He said protesters were taken into custody after they were warned to leave clinic property. About 200 demonstrators carrying picket signs remained after the arrests to continue their protest, he said. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, more than 700 people, opposing and supporting abortion, demonstrated outside two medical clinics, with anti-abortion forces blocking entry to one clinic for several hours. Police in riot gear stood by but no arrests were made. The two groups clashed verbally, but no altercations were reported. As the anti-abortion demonstrators locked arms and sang hymns, the pro-choice activists shouted, `` Right to life, your name's a lie, you do n't care if women die.'' `` It was a tremendous success,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, national field director for Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group that sponsored the demonstration. Counterdemonstrators also claimed success, citing their large turnout. `` I think it shows the country that pro-choice activists are ready to do battle,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, one of the organizers for the Pro-Choice Coalition.

 The pilot of an F-5E jet fighter from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> that crashed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has asked authorities to help him find his uncle, an official report said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xianshun </PERSON>, 35, who parachuted to safety Saturday, was looking for his uncle, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuyi </PERSON>. `` But authorities have yet to find the uncle,'' said an official at the state-run news agency. The official, who would only identify himself as <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON>, said it was not clear whether the pilot wished to defect to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` He has only raised this one request _ to see his uncle,'' he said. `` We are trying to interview him but he is still in the hospital.'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said the fighter, which was on a training flight, lost contact with a radio tower at <LOCATION> Chihhang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> on Saturday morning. The plane went down in a rice paddy in <LOCATION> Fengshun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> later that morning, about 180 miles north of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province, Chinese reports said. Chinese reports said the plane crashed because it ran out of oil. <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> television reported <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> was taken by helicopter to the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. A Chinese reporter Saturday night said <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> was injured slightly on his backside and arm. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, a relative of the pilot said he believed the officer defected to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to see his grandmother. But the pilot's wife, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuezhen </PERSON>, said she believed her husband had lost his way in bad weather. The relative, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity from <LOCATION> Miaoli </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> had complained that military officers were banned from visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In 1987, the Nationalist government in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> eased a ban to allow all Taiwanese, except military personnel and government employees, to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. More than a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officers have sought asylum in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1949 when the Nationalists fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after losing a civil war to the Communist forces on the mainland. The latest was <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawei </PERSON>, who defected in 1983 in a trainer plane. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> received $ 40,000 plus use of a chauffeured limousine. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> late last year abolished the system of rewards for Taiwanese military personnel defecting to the mainland. The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> still offers rewards for <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military defectors but they reduced them in September when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> stopped its rewards. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> regards <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as a renegade province and the two are technically at war.

 Political leaders hailed as a milestone on Friday President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that Puerto Ricans should vote on whether they want the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island to remain a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth, become the 51st state or be independent. `` We are living a historic moment in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>. `` I give the words of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> my warmest welcome.'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and other island politicians have been lobbying in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in support for a plebiscite so <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s 3.3 million people can vote on their political future. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday night: `` I have long believed that the people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> should have the right to determine their own political future. Personally I favor statehood. But I ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take the necessary steps to let the people decide in a referendum.'' His statement followed a joint call on Jan. 17 by <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s three main political parties _ divided over the status issue _ for congressional support for a plebiscite They asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation guaranteeing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would honor the election results, whatever the outcome. `` The people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> have not been formally consulted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as to their choice of their ultimate political status,'' they said in a statement. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosello </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which advocates statehood, said the statement `` is the type of message we were expecting from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. When the president says he is in favor of the process and asks for congressional cooperation, it gives a seriousness to the issue which never before existed.'' <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>, who as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favors breaking ties binding <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement. `` The actual status is unjustifiable because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ca n't continue supporting colonialism in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> supports the commonwealth arrangement, but wants <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to relinquish control over immigration and foreign trade matters. The emotional status issue has dominated the governor's agenda. The three party leaders are to meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> soon with key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee leaders. In a 1967 referendum, 60 percent of Puerto Ricans favored the commonwealth status, 39 wanted statehood and 1 percent voted for independence. However, the referendum was not recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was not bound to take action no matter what the outcome. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> wants to make sure that in any future referendum, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will guarantee to abide by the results. Without that, he has said, `` it would be an exercise in futility.'' Under commonwealth status, Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, but can not vote for president. They have a representative to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who can not vote. They are eligible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military service and receive billions of federal benefits annually, but they do n't pay <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> has been a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth since 1952. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ceded the island to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the Spanish-American war in 1898.

<HEAD>Three Food Scares Prompt Government Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A food-poisoning scare prompted a government warning Friday to pregnant women against eating soft cheeses, and farmers were ordered to slaughter salmonella-infected chicken flocks. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> faced food-poisoning scares on three fronts as police were called in to investigate the mercury contamination of butter from the country's largest producer. Sir <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON>, the government's chief medical officer, warned pregnant women not to eat soft cheeses such as Camembert and brie after these were linked to several listeria infections in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad. The bacteria could cause miscarriages and stillbirths, he said. The Lancet, a British medical journal, reported last week that two women infected with listeria suffered spontaneous abortions at a British hospital, while two other listeria-infected women had to have Caesarian operations to save their babies. <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Camembert </PERSON> was safe to eat for everyone except pregnant women. `` As far as listeria is concerned, the risk is so small that it is quite appropriate for the rest of the public to carry on as before.'' <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the domestic news agency, said the government planned to set up a committee to examine all aspects of food poisoning. <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> listed several other measures the public should take to avoid food poisoning. His remarks, at a news conference, reflected heightened public alarm over food poisoning, which began in December with a salmonella-in-eggs scare. Egg sales fell 60 percent after a junior health minister, <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, said most British egg production was infected with salmonella. Confronted by lawsuits from angry farmers, Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> resigned, but the affair has prompted a major debate. Also on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that chicken flocks contaminated by salmonella would be slaughtered and their owners compensated. It said new compulsory monitoring of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 45,000 flocks had been introduced. Compensation will be paid according to the bird's value immediately before slaughter, said a spokesman, who requested anonymity It said the volume of compensation, and the number of birds likely to be slaughtered, were not yet known. Egg producers and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the announcement, and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it showed that `` the government was at last waking up to the problem.'' Detectives were called to a creamery belonging to <LOCATION> Dairy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest dairy chain, in <LOCATION> Camborne </LOCATION>, in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, after mercury was found in a tub of butter at a central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> supermarket. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reay </PERSON>, the detective leading the inquiry, said: `` At this stage there is no evidence to suggest that contamination of the product is widespread.'' The plant where the contaminated butter was made is to close with the loss of 118 jobs, but company spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON> said he doubted the mercury was planted by a disgruntled worker.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor and hospital director who resigned his posts amid charges of plagiarism has been rehired by the hospital, officials said Friday. Dr. <PERSON> Shervert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, 67, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, was named <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>'s staff psychiatrist and psychiatrist in chief emeritus, an honorary position. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> stepped down as hospital director and psychiatry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> four months ago after a faculty committee concluded he had plagiarized portions of four papers between 1966 and 1975. His forced resignation sparked criticism from several leading psychiatrists, who said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials had overreacted. `` If <PERSON> Sherv </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> had done something like fudge numbers that killed people, we would n't be having this conversation,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` But when a review article quoted a number of authors and some were not given full acknowledgement, I'm not sure he should have been so severely punished.''

 Communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is likely to accede to the 1951 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Convention on the Status of Refugees, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday.

Asked when, he said only, `` Soon, in the coming months.''

 The government is investigating reports of illegal trading by all but one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 25 stock brokerage houses in connection with the 1987 market crash, an official was quoted as saying Friday. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Addona </PERSON>, the country's fiscal attorney general, was quoted as saying his department has received 50 complaints of alleged stockbreaker fraud stemming from the crash.

He said investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> were being carried out `` without regard to the political or economic power of those involved.'' `` There exist accusations against all of the brokerage firms except one.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's political parties on Friday agreed to talk with a delegation of guerrilla commanders about a rebel proposal to participate in this year's presidential election. The 13 political parties, however, did not agree to the rebel demand that the elections be postponed from March 19 to September. The guerrillas' proposal to participate in the elections was made on Jan. 24. Their demand that the balloting be delayed was strongly opposed by President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and the armed forces. <PERSON> Aronette </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference that the political parties agreed that the guerrilla proposal contains positive elements but that `` doubts and questions'' about the offer would be expressed to guerrilla leaders. Mrs. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said the parties agreed to send their questions about the proposal to the guerrillas on Monday. Three days after the rebel response is received, she said, the parties will invite a delegation of commanders `` to hold direct conversations in a mutually agreed upon place.'' Two guerrilla commanders had offered Thursday to travel to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to initiate face-to-face talks on the proposal with party and government representatives. The guerrilla offer to participate in elections was a drastic shift. The Marxist-led rebels waging a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government have boycotted the five national elections held this decade. The rebels contend elections are part of a U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency project to put a civilian facade on a military-dominated government. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, two Salvadoran rebel commanders met with Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> to seek his support on their proposal when he meets with fellow Central American leaders beginning on Monday. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Letona </PERSON> told a news conference in the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> that they also sent letters to presidents <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> de <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, seeking their support for the proposal. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, along with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, are scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> Monday and Tuesday. The presidents are to discuss a stalled peace plan they signed in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> in 1987 which calls for political amnesties and an end to civil wars in the region. The foreign ministers of the five nations on Wednesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to send a multinational force of inspectors to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to verify that no country supports subversion against their neighbors.

 A jury was selected Friday for the court-martial of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain charged with failing to rescue more than 80 Vietnamese boat people who later resorted to cannibalism to survive. The first witnesses against Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> are to testify on Monday. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, is accused of violating lawful orders and dereliction of duty after his vessel, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dubuque </ORGANIZATION>, allegedly refused to help a boatload of Vietnamese refugees in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on June 9. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said 110 Vietnamese sailed from their homeland, and that at least 83 men, women and children were still alive when their vessel met the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said 31 of the Vietnamese died after encountering the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> about 210 miles north of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. Survivors said two died of starvation and three others were murdered and eaten by fellow passengers before Filipino fishermen rescued the Vietnamese on June 27 after 37 days at sea. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, who won a Silver Star and a Purple Heart in the Vietnam War, could face 4 -LCB- years in prison and a dishonorable discharge if convicted on all counts, officials said. Four of the six jurors must agree on a conviction. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> has been charged with failing to rescue an unknown Vietnamese who swam toward the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> at risk to his life; failing to rescue a second Vietnamese who tried to climb the warship's ropes but was shaken off; and failing to render assistance to refugees `` in life-endangering circumstances.'' He told investigators the Vietnamese boat was seaworthy and that his crew provided it with food, water and navigational directions. During Friday's proceedings, defense lawyer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donato </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, asked each of the jurors whether they knew enough about the case to have formed an opinion. Each indicated he had not. <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> then told them that if a vote were taken now, `` you're supposed to vote not guilty. Two prospective jurors, both captains, were dismissed on challenges by both the prosecution and defense. The eight prospective jurors, including six <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captains, were brought here from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, an amphibious landing ship, was en route to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to assist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minesweepers when it crossed paths with the Vietnamese ship about 230 miles north of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. The Vietnamese reported the encounter with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship after reaching a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee camp on <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was relieved temporarily of his command on Aug. 13.

 Worries about rising inflation and interest rates touched off the biggest stock selloff of the year, depressed bond prices and boosted the dollar's value against foreign currencies.

 The stock market's early-1989 rally has hit its first snag, but the optimists of Wall Street profess not to be concerned. In the face of negative news on inflation and a renewed rise in interest rates, a stretch of five consecutive weekly gains that coincided with the start of the new year came to an end this past week. Many analysts say they would n't be surprised if the `` correction,'' or period of retrenchment, lasted a while longer. But the bulls argue that such a sequence would actually represent a happy development for investors who did n't get a chance to join in the party earlier. `` Signs that the current rally is maturing continue to pile up,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON>, technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, in his latest market appraisal. Over the next few weeks, <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON> says, the market may well undergo a `` consolidation'' in which the major averages fall somewhere on the order of 4 percent to 7 percent. But he contends `` the bull market is just beginning'' for industrial stocks in particular. `` Since we remain very bullish long term, we suggest using the coming consolidation as a buying opportunity.'' Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> says a `` fairly shallow'' pullback is in prospect over the near term. `` We think a renewed advance in the spring could carry the Dow industrials to the 2,500 area before a more significant correction might occur. `` A change in investor psychology appears to be contributing more to the bullish atmosphere than any changes in the outlooks for the economy or corporate profits. Investors appear more willing to accent the positive than the negative.'' This new upbeat spirit got a stern test in recent days when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a much larger-than-expected rise of 1 percent in the producer price index for January, and banks across the country raised their prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11 percent. The producer price increase, the biggest in more than three years, intensified expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would soon tighten credit further. At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at 2,286.07, down 45.18 from the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index fell 2.49 to 164.01 on the week; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 3.98 to 402.37, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 2.11 at 322.77. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 191.09 million shares a day, against 186.79 million the week before. While brokers naturally like the revived enthusiasm for stocks, they are wary of seeing too much of a good thing. If everyone becomes a believer in the market, they reason, the rally that results could be explosive but short. Memories remain fresh of what followed the high spirits and complacency that prevailed for much of 1987. At the moment, however, most observers say a healthy amount of skepticism persists. `` A good sign _ options traders are still pessimistic,'' asserts the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> letter. `` Trading in puts -LRB- options to sell stock -RRB- remains fairly high in relation to trading in calls -LRB- options to buy stocks -RRB-. `` We interpret this indicator on a contrary basis, so recent readings appear to be a favorable sign for stocks.'' While optimism has been increasing steadily among investment advisers, reports Investors Intelligence of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, measures of sentiment `` are still bullish and lots of cash is still on the sidelines.''

 Do n't look for a sexy swimsuit issue from the latest offspring of Sport Illustrated. Sports Illustrated for Kids is aimed at the 8-to-13-year-old crowd, and publisher <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> promises the only people the magazine will show in bathing suits will be competing in sports like swimming, water skiing or surfing or else will likely have `` an Olympic gold medal around their neck.'' The magazine was launched in January after Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> secured quarter-million dollar commitments from 30 advertisers. Half the 500,000 circulation is sold by subscription or, starting with the March issue, at newstands. The other 250,000 copies are given free to third - through sixth-graders in 1,000 of the poorest schools in the nation They include places like <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, where the head of the reading resources program, <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>, says few students could afford a magazine subscription `` My teachers have been so grateful to have them,'' she said. `` The kids love it. They say things like, ` You mean it's ours to keep?''' She hopes the magazine will encourage students to read. `` It's something current and the look of it is so nice that it makes them want to pick it up and read it. That's half the battle there,'' she said. Those are reassuring words to <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who says she worked more than 18 months on developing and launching the magazine. Improving literacy was one of the pitches she used in persuading companies such as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, as well as sneaker and snack makers, to pay $ 250,000 each for a year's worth of advertising space. But the motivation is n't entirely altruistic. The magazine is expected to make a profit eventually, Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. She said it also should produce some readers for `` Big SI,'' as she calls the magazine that spawned it. A year's subscription costs $ 15.95 and single copies will sell for $ 1.75. The free copies come with tips for teachers on how to use the issue in class. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannings </PERSON>, a health and physical education teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Adamsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said, `` I set aside one day a month to go through each article with them to practice their reading skills.'' For advertisers, the magazine is supposed to offer an appealing new avenue to youngsters who are often hard to reach with print ads. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> estimates there are 16 million youngsters in the magazine's target audience, and said they spend $ 5 billion a year of their own money and influence another $ 40 billion spent by their parents. But at $ 25,000 a page and a guaranteed circulation of 500,000, the advertisers are paying a premium over other magazines aimed at children. Boys' Life magazine, for instance, charges $ 17,650 for a page and has a monthly circulation of 1.3 million. <ORGANIZATION> Scholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> charges $ 10,000 for a page in <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholastic </ORGANIZATION> magazine with a bimonthly circulation of 700,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said she tried to avoid making her magazine something that youngsters `` perceive to be good for them.'' The January issue profiled basketball's <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, football's <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, sled racer <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> and described the ride two 10-year-olds took in a blimp. Each issue has regular sections explaining rules of the game, advice from the pros, a celebrity's description of his or her worst day, a poster of an athlete, training tips, sports quizzes and trading cards. Some advertisers developed unique approaches. Foot Locker's ads ask who was first to achieve athletic feats, such as who first shattered a basketball backboard. Converse shoe ads address questions children have directed to athletes such as football's <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosar </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' ads trace the history of flying machines. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokeswoman, said the carrier wants to impress on children that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is a quality company. `` When they start thinking about careers, we hope they think <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> might be a real good place for them to work,'' she said. Publisher <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> makes no apologies for sending a magazine with paid ads into the school rooms. `` We have researched this with teachers and parents and they welcomed the idea of having a real magazine with ads,'' she said. Some types of ads such as cigarettes or liquor are prohibited and she hopes to keep the proportion of ads to editorial copy low. Teachers said advertising is a small price to pay for the benefits of getting a quality magazine free. A school official in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who asked not to be identified by name, said her teachers have used the magazine to teach students how advertising works. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> said she has heard no complaints about the ads. `` Would n't that be nice -LRB- if the magazine carried no ads -RRB- but the real world is n't like that,'' she said.

<HEAD>Survival of the Fittest Prevails in Airline Jungle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If a decade of airline deregulation has proven anything, it's the strong get stronger, the weak get weaker, bad labor relations are poisonous and cheap fares may be secondary to new planes and swank service. All those elements melded together in the jungle of airline competition this past week and seemed to underscore the idea that <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>'s survival of the fittest theory is profoundly reshaping the landscape of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers, 10 years after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unleashed them to set fares and routes on their own. American said it was acquiring new <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> jets in a deal that analysts said could be worth as much as $ 7 billion, potentially one of the biggest fleet modernizations ever. The MD-11 jumbos and smaller MD-80 twinjets would replace American's aging DC-10s and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s. American's announcement came against a background of rising concern about the safety of older planes, no matter how well they're maintained The enormous metal stress caused by repeated landings and takeoffs has been increasingly mentioned as a possible source of trouble, and some analysts say it has influenced the public's perception about which airline to fly If that's true, the carriers with the newest planes stand to sell more seats. American was n't the only airline to buy planes this past week. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it ordered 10 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A330 jetliners worth $ 860 million. The high-tech planes are built by the European rival to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. Both airlines are among the biggest and most profitable in the country, partly because they have relied on a strategy of improving service instead of simply slashing fares, industry analysts have said. While American and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> were shopping, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was scrambling to plan for what could be a devastating walkout in March, a key month for the money-losing airline because it is the height of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation season. Eastern's militant machinists vowed to strike because of an impasse over labor concessions demanded by management, an issue that has inflamed passions at the airline for years and played a role in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s steadily eroding base of customers. In a prelude of what may come, the airline suspended 100 wildcatters and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots hinted they may honor any picket lines. The fighting coincided with an announcement by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that it lost $ 224.4 million in the last three months of 1988 and $ 718.6 million for the year, the worst in aviation history. The previous record was held by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 485 million in 1982. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, dropped hints of its own problems. The airline's chairman, ex-Texas Air aide <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, told an industry seminar that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> must expand operations to survive. One way to do this, he said, is through an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> by another airline. In other business and economic developments this past week: _ Disappointment with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget strategy, a sharp jump in wholesale prices and other concerns about rising inflation spooked Wall Street and sent the Dow Jones industrials reeling for a weekly loss of 45.18 points _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled a plan to rescue the nation's ailing savings <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; loan industry that includes a $ 50 billion bond sale to fund bailouts, higher deposit insurance rates and seizure of sick thrifts by federal banking regulators _ <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s top high-yield bond trader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> moved to block the firm's record securities-fraud settlement with the government on grounds it violates his rights by denying him his multimillion-dollar pay There were also reports that talks between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to finalize the settlement had stalled. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> proposed a controversial rule that would require companies to deduct billions of dollars in profits to reflect the cost of retiree benefits Many companies are expected to fight the proposed rule.

 Some economists expect the nation's biggest banks to raise their prime interest rates at least once more before spring, even though the banks have just nudged the key rate up half a percentage point. Major banks on Friday raised their prime rates to 11 percent from 10.5 percent to keep pace with rising rates on financial markets. It was the first increase of 1989 for the prime rate, which is a benchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumer and corporate loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages. Friday's increase put the prime rate at its highest level since it reached 10.75 percent in late 1984. The last increase, from 10 percent to 10.5 percent, occurred Nov. 28. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> were the first to increase the prime and soon were followed by <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank, and other money center banks. The increase had been widely expected by economists. `` It was inevitable,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting service in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Short term interest rates have been trending upward.'' The prime reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest it pays on customer accounts, short-term certificates of deposit and bonds, and as such mirrors rather than forecasts rate trends. Market rates have been rising due partly to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s tightening of credit in an attempt to fight inflation Records released Friday indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank's policy-making body, decided in December to boost interest rates to help hold down inflation. Short-term rates in the credit markets have risen more rapidly than long-term rates in recent weeks. In an unusual situation earlier this week rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities briefly were higher than those for long-term bonds, indicating investors believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was tightening credit and that inflation would decline in the long term. A government report Friday on inflation worsened the outlook for interest rates and `` was really the last straw'' for the banks, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its producer price index surged at an annual rate of 12.7 percent in January. Rates rose in the credit markets after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report, as traders were convinced the jump in wholesale prices would force the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to push interest rates even higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year issue was off nearly $ 5.65 per each $ 1,000 in face value in late trading. That boosted the yield on the bond _ which itself is considered a barometer of rate speculation _ to 9.04 percent from 8.89 percent late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could directly drive rates upward by raising its own discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to commercial banks. However, <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governors likely would take a more indirect route, by putting further upward pressure on the so-called federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight loans. <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> anticipated there would be at least one more jump in the prime rate before spring, especially if the government issued more reports indicating a surging economy and soaring inflation. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> predicted interest rates would peak before April or May because the economy is likely to show some signs of slowing down. One reason for a slowdown would be higher interest rates, he said.

 Worries about rising inflation and interest rates sparked the biggest stock selloff of the year, depressed bond prices and boosted the dollar's value in foreign exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 36.97 points to 2,286.07 on Friday, the biggest drop in that key market indicator since Nov. 16. An accompanying decline in the bond market was more modest but it extended the losses bonds suffered in a Thursday selloff, which was the sharpest in three months for the credit markets. Meanwhile, the dollar rallied on the prospect that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might tighten its monetary policy _ pushing interest rates even higher _ in an effort to choke off inflation. Separately, the nation's biggest banks boosted their prime lending rates by a half percentage point to 11 percent, the highest level since late 1984 and a reflection of recent rises in other rates. Roiling the financial markets was the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report Friday morning that wholesale prices jumped 1 percent in January. The increase was about twice as large as expected. Bond prices tumbled and interest rates surged higher within moments of the report. `` In the first couple of minutes, there was absolute shock,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, fixed-income research director for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market went down hard.'' Prices of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond, considered a sensitive gauge of interest rate speculation, fell $ 10 for every $ 1,000 in face value during a burst of trading after the report. Prices edged back up later in the day in more subdued activity. By late trading, prices of the benchmark 30-year bond were down about $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value and the yield jumped to 9.03 percent from 8.89 percent late Thursday. That loss came on top of Thursday's setback that saw the price of 30-year bonds sink $ 16.25 for every $ 1,000 in face value. On Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average lost 18 points after the first 30 minutes of trading, recoverted somewhat at midday but deteriorated in the afternoon to finish with a 36.97-point loss for the day. But the inflation report supported the dollar, which benefits from speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will tighten credit and boost interest rates, which make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors. By the end of trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 1.8695 West German marks, up from 1.8475 late Thursday, and at 128.68 Japanese yen, up from 127.93 late Thursday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday also was cited for the sour performance in the stock and bond markets, as traders faulted him for failing to propose more aggressive steps to trim the federal deficit. `` The markets looked at it as a warmed-over version of -LRB- former President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget. Any changes were modest and around the edges,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON>, senior financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Friday's increase put the prime rate at its highest level since it reached 10.75 percent in late 1984. The last increase, from 10 percent to 10.5 percent, occurred Nov. 28. Some analysts said they expect further increases for the prime, which is a benchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumer and corporate loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages.

<HEAD>Milken Moves to Block Drexel Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s top bond trader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has moved to block the firm's record criminal fraud settlement on grounds it illegally denies him his job and multimillion-dollar pay. Attorneys for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> on Friday asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> to reject <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 650 million settlement with the government on the grounds it violates his constitutional rights. If successful, the motion could force prosecutors and defense attorneys back into negotiations _ or possibly court _ after a two-year investigation and settlement that allowed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to avoid a potentially lengthy and embarrassing trial. `` The prosecutor here is acting like a sheriff in the <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ solely on his own initiative and in his wholly unfettered discretion,'' said the motion filed with <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is one of the biggest targets of a federal crackdown on securities-law abuse and is expected to be indicted soon on fraud and racketeering charges stemming from his powerful position at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest investment firms. The pressure on him has intensified since <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as part of its plea-bargain settlement. Details of the agreement, made public two weeks ago, also require <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to withhold at least half of the money due to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s brother, senior <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, for 1988 and to suspend him if indicted `` The prosecutor seeks ... to achieve indirectly what he could not achieve directly _ to punish the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> through the imposition of multimillion-dollar fines and the deprivation of their livelihoods without indictment, hearing and trials,'' the 28-page motion by defense attorneys said. `` This action both denies them due process of law and constitutes an unconstitutional taking of property,'' it added. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> declined to comment on the motion, saying the government would respond in court papers. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, Calif.-based high-yield `` junk'' bond department, has been credited with pioneering the $ 175 billion market for these debt securities, used to finance takeovers and the growth of small companies. The motion said his 1988 pay would `` greatly exceed $ 100 million,'' almost entirely through a yearly bonus tied to his performance. Neither <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has been charged with any criminal activity and both have denied wrongdoing. `` This is the government using <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to take money that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> have already earned without bringing a charge against either of them,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. The motion said the agreement violates their rights because it precedes hearings on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> committed any crime, whether their property can be legally seized or whether there is any lawful basis for suspending them. In settling criminal charges with the government, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $ 300 million in fines and civil penalties. Another $ 350 million would be placed in an account to settle potential civil claims. The agreement, reached Dec. 21 after two years of investigation of the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, included allegations of crooked deals with now-imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and the defunct securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. The pact remains subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the court. Negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> reportedly have stalled because of an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> demand that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> move its junk bond division to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Once approved by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the agreement is to be sent to Judge Wood for final approval. In a separate letter to the judge, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said the plea agreement was improperly filed with the court and should not have been disclosed publicly until <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> formally enters a guilty plea. Details of the agreement were revealed after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> requested that the specific counts be unsealed. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who left office the week after the charges were made public, made prosecuting Wall Street crimes a priority of his five-year tenure. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most profitable investment concerns in the country with 10,000 employees worldwide.

 Attorneys for <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the one-time stock speculator who now works on a prison cleanup crew, are waiting for indictments in a related Wall Street scandal before requesting his early release, sources said. The lawyers reportedly are waiting to see whether disgraced high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is indicted in a case based on information supplied by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> before moving to have <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s three-year term shortened. The attorneys believe an indictment of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> would be further evidence of the value of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s information in weeding out <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> corruption, according to sources close to the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Friday, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has not applied for parole from the minimum security prison camp in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and has no current plans to do so. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> becomes eligible for parole on March 21. He began serving his sentence at the 44,000-acre former military barracks about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last March 23. `` He will seek a parole hearing at the point where his advisers think it is most likely he would get some kind of favorable consideration,'' <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said. `` There has been no parole hearing date scheduled. There is nothing imminent.'' <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said there was `` no chance'' <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> would be released by March on parole and `` relatively little chance'' he would be freed on a judge's order. Parole hearings at the 689-inmate prison, known as `` Club Fed'' because of recreation facilities including a tennis court and boccie ball court, are held every other month and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is not on the March docket, <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> unit manager <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> said. Under federal prison sentencing guidelines, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s earliest possible non-parole release date based on good behavior is April 4, 1990. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, once Wall Street's best-known speculator in the stocks of potential takeover targets, is now working on a prison cleanup crew, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said. He is likely to be released early only if <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>, who sentenced <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, rewards his cooperation in helping nail other Wall Street felons. Last April, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s lawyers asked <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> to reduce his sentence on grounds that information <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> gave the government unearthed other fraud cases, including the mammoth investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> that resulted in a record $ 650 million plea-bargain settlement in December. The attorneys asked <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> to wait until this past October to hear their motion, but have delayed even longer. Sources close to the case said <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s lawyers are waiting to see whether <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is indicted on fraud charges before pressing for <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s release. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is expected to be charged as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s plea deal, in which the securities firm agreed to pay $ 650 million in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felony counts. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> could be expected to ask <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> for a hearing on early release `` fairly quickly'' after <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is indicted, one source said, adding that a pending final agreement on terms of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> settlement also could help <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s case. `` In the atmosphere of trying to show that his post-sentence and present cooperation has shown real tangible fruits, it's better that it's settled,'' said the source. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said there has been no change in the status of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s case. He declined to comment on whether the government would oppose any early release request. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, 52, stunned the financial world in November 1986 when he paid the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> $ 100 million to settle charges he illegally used nonpublic insider information to profit in securities deals. He was banished from the securities business for life. He then cooperated in a massive federal probe that has resulted in criminal or civil charges in nearly two dozen cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In return, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was allowed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>.

 Everyone talks about inflation. The steam boiler operators of the American economy do something about it. The boiler operators are the little-known <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> functionaries who add steam to the economy or take it away by manipulating the reserves of the banking system. The importance of their manipulations became obvious Friday when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported wholesale inflation in January skyrocketed to an annual rate of 12.7 percent. It was apparent, too, when major banks raised their prime rate to 11 percent _ the highest level since 1984. The combination of high rates and high inflation leaves the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in a delicate position: Should it push rates even higher and risk triggering a recession? Or should it leave rates where they are and risk allowing inflation to rage out of control? The policy decisions are made in secret by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 12 <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governors and regional <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bank presidents. The people who carry out those decisions _ the steam boiler operators _ sit on the eighth floor of an imposing Italian Renaissance-style building near Wall Street, the home of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> runs the 20-person open market trading desk. She reports to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternlight </PERSON>, who in turn answers to the Federal Open Market Committee. Unlike ordinary bond traders, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> traders usually enter the market just once a day, and they do n't care about profits. Their only job is to keep excess banking reserves at the level specified by the Open Market Committee. The bedrock assumption is that banks will lend up to the limit permitted by their level of reserves. If banks get more reserves, they will increase their lending. If they lose reserves they will have to cut back lending. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wants to stoke the furnace of the economy, it buys <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills in the open market. The cash it spends for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills ends up as extra reserves on the books of commercial banks. The banks increase lending and the economy expands. Conversely, selling <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills drains reserves from the banking system and banks have to cut back on lending. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> traders monitor the federal funds rate, which is how much banks charge each other for the overnight loans they need to meet their reserve requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can make direct loans to the banks at what it calls the discount rate. But borrowing at the discount `` window'' is a privilege, not a right, and banks use it sparingly. If the fed funds rate gets too high, the open market desk injects reserves into the system by buying <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. If the rate drops they sell bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also trades in other government securities, but less frequently. No small player, it typically does transactions of $ 2 billion or $ 3 billion at once. For short-term fine-tuning, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can inject reserves temporarily through repurchase agreements, known as `` repos.'' Customers sell <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> with the agreement to repurchase them soon, usually the next day. To drain reserves temporarily, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does matched sale-purchase agreements, or `` matched sales.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> sells securities to customers and agrees to buy them back a few days later. Not every <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> move is fraught with significance. For instance, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> drains reserves every month to compensate for deposits of government checks. In the face of turmoil in the markets and uncertainty about the economy's direction, the goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s steam boiler operators is simply stability. `` Achieving this in the face of very large flows of funds in and out of the economy which are not under our control, that's the skill of the open market desk,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakstansky </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
