 A fast-moving storm raked central and northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> with hail and high winds on Monday, delaying hundreds of flights at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> airports, and forcing the evacuation of two schools and a factory near <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. The storm forced delays of 225 jetliners flying into and out of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the nation's busiest, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Handschiegel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The average delay was an hour and 15 minutes and the maximum was three hours,'' he said. Flights also were delayed at Midway airport as a tornado watch was issued for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area Monday afternoon. A water spout was reported on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> about 2 p.m., weather service officials said, but it caused no damage. The storm, caused by a collision between a warm front from the south and a cold front from the north, was headed east, weather officials said. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was expecting mostly sunny skies Tuesday, with highs in the 50s and 60s. Five people were reported struck by lightning in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, and one, an electrician, remained hospitalized in stable condition Monday night. In <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the storm unleashed wind gusts up to 63 mph and golf-ball-sized hail, causing extensive damage to buildings, homes and several schools Monday morning. `` We got no warning, no sirens, no nothing,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, school superintendent at <LOCATION> Dunlap </LOCATION>, about six miles northwest of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. `` It was a freak storm that blew up out of nowhere. I was sitting here at my window and I saw it get dark. `` Within about 15 seconds it was really blowing and there was a tremendous electrical storm. Car windows were popping out and exploding, glass was breaking and trees and power lines went down.'' Youngsters at the five <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> school buildings were unscathed, although the 500 high school students were ushered outside and classes canceled when officials smelled smoke and feared a fire. Officials found roof damage but no fire. The <ORGANIZATION> Mossville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Dunlap </LOCATION>, also was closed because of roof damage. Assembly lines were shut down for about 30 minutes and employees were evacuated from shops at <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Mossville </LOCATION> engine plant in a complex that employs about 5,000 people, said <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolde </PERSON>, company spokesman.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s justice minister on Monday urged the widow of a Nazi war criminal not to come to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to promote a book on how she helped her husband escape from a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> military prison in 1977. <PERSON> Giuliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassalli </PERSON> said that such a visit solely for publicity `` is the cause of legitimate concern'' by relatives of those killed in a massacre for which <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappler </PERSON> was judged responsibile. <PERSON> Kappler </PERSON>, an SS colonel in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> during World War II, was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the massacre of 335 Italians in 1944. He escaped in August 1977, reportedly concealed in a large suitcase wheeled out of the prison by his wife. <PERSON> Kappler </PERSON> died of cancer a year later in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. His widow, <PERSON> Annelise </PERSON>, said last week she would come to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Saturday to present her book `` I Will Bring You Home.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Vassalli </PERSON> issued a statement in response to a letter he received from Mrs. <PERSON> Kappler </PERSON> in which she stated why she planned to come to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and asked his opinion. Three senators representing <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest political parties, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Communists and Socialists, asked the government Monday to declare what measures it would take to keep Mrs. <PERSON> Kappler </PERSON> out of the country. But the government did not say immediately if it might take legal action. Law provides a prison term of up to 10 years for aiding the escape of a convict sentenced to life.

<HEAD>Jet Tried For Seldom-Used, Less Equipped Runway, Union Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main airport killing 31 people was aiming for a seldom-used runway that lacks sophisticated landing equipment, an Italian union official said The choice of the runway meant that the pilot had to calculate how to land the Boeing 707 at the fog-shrouded airport, instead of having electronic equipment guide him, said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Gariup </PERSON>, president of the main Italian pilots' union. The red, yellow and white jet plowed through three houses and a rental-car parking lot before coming to rest in a field and bursting into flames early Monday. Thirty-one people were killed, including six of the seven crew members; 21 were injured. Most of those on board Flight QU775 were Ugandans traveling from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> da Vinci Airport. Two Nigerians were listed among the injured, while the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said seven or eight passengers were Britons. The airport said it did not yet have a complete list of passenger identities. <PERSON> Gariup </PERSON> said the pilot apparently chose runway `` 34 Left'' because visibility was slightly better there than on two other runways he had previously approached. However, the strip lacked the Instrument Landing System installed at other runways to provide information to pilots about their altitude, said <PERSON> Gariup </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION>. The pilot therefore had to target his descent using information from the control tower and his view of the runway, <PERSON> Gariup </PERSON> said. The pilot `` had to calculate every minute, based on the distance to the airport, how he had to approach,'' <PERSON> Gariup </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday night with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` With the other system, the instruments would tell him if he was too low.'' `` Perhaps he miscalculated or perhaps he saw something else that he thought was the runway.'' There was no answer at the airport director's office or the press office Monday evening, but an air traffic controller in the flight tower confirmed that the runway was not frequently used and lacked the landing equipment other strips had. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Government and airport authorities emphasized that they had not yet established the cause of the crash. The Italian government announced Monday evening that a nine-man commission would investigate, in addition to a judicial board. The commander of the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> province's fire department, <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiucini </PERSON>, who helped coordinate the rescue, speculated in a telephone interview that there was a `` misunderstanding'' between the control tower and the pilot since the plane approached at such a low altitude. However, the air traffic controllers' union denied there had been any misunderstanding. Other officials noted there had not yet been an examination of the `` black box,'' which records flight information data, or the recordings of the pilot's conversations with the tower. Among those who survived were a British dairy farmer and his 26-year-old wife who leaped from the burning aircraft clutching their 8-month-old son. `` We jumped out of a hole in the fuselage behind us,'' <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gait </PERSON>, 31, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at Sant ` <ORGANIZATION> Eugenio </ORGANIZATION> `` <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> jumped backward, holding -LRB- baby <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> -RRB- to her chest, and then fell about six feet to the ground. I picked them up. We walked about 200 yards and then some Ugandans came out.'' The Gaits, who suffered minor burns, were on their way to the African nation to work with a charity project that provides farmers with cows. Chunks of the aircraft and passengers' clothing covered a wide swath in the plane's wake. Long after the crash, hundreds of sheets of blue-lined paper stamped `` <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'' still blanketed the ground.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> kissed a girl with flowers and shook hands with robe-clad notables, but once the organized hoopla was over, the reception in this <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> town for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader turned frosty. Polls show the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> might lose half its Arab support, partly because <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 man, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, is held responsible for the harsh crackdown on the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Labor and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> are running neck-to-neck and a drop in Arab support for Labor could hand the Nov. 1 election to <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. `` Are you going to vote for us?'' a shirt-sleaved <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, surrounded by a dozen security men, asked a resident Monday during a walking tour of <PERSON> Shfaram </PERSON>, a northern Israeli town of 26,000. The man did not answer, and instead told <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> the town needed better roads. Responded Peres: `` If we get enough votes, we'll get the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and then we can do it.'' In an attempt at conviviality, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> greeted a woman with the Arabic phrase `` sabah ilher,'' but after being told he had said `` good morning'' instead of the intended `` good evening,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> stuck to Hebrew. Most Shfaram residents stayed indoors or watched from their balconies as <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and a few dozen party activists walked through the town which in 1984 gave half its votes to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. During a reception at the home of local <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was handed flowers by <PERSON> Mishal </PERSON>'s daughter who wore a Hebrew sticker reading `` I'm also for Labor.'' <PERSON> Mishal </PERSON> had invited about 150 Arab notables who shook hands with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and provided the backdrop for brief welcoming speeches. At a later rally, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> urged Israeli Arabs not to `` waste'' their votes on the communists or the Progressive List for Peace. Both are pro-PLO and unacceptable to Labor as coalition partners. `` If this time, there is no peace, it will be the fault of the Israeli Arabs. If you waste your votes, nothing is going to happen,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told about 500 people who listened in silence and applauded briefly and politely at the end. About 330,000 of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 800,000 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> citizens are eligible to vote this year, and could control 14 seats in the 120-member Parliament. In 1984, one in four Arabs voted Labor, giving the party the three seats that provided its 44-41 advantage over <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. But this year, support for Labor is slipping, mainly because of growing Israeli Arab identification with the 10-month-old uprising that has claimed at least 299 Palestinian and six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> lives. Analysts say Labor could lose 1.5 seats in the Arab sector. `` Many people do n't want to vote for Labor because of what <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> is doing in the occupied territories,'' said a 37-year-old carpenter in the Arab town of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Shfaram </LOCATION>. The man, who said he supported Labor in 1984, spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked whether <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was a liability for Labor's <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was evasive. `` I think they -LRB- Arab voters -RRB- must understand the situation as it is, and I hope they will change their minds,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in Shfaram. But <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activists in <LOCATION> Shfaram </LOCATION> were optimistic that the revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation would boost their chances. `` We'll get more votes because of the uprising,'' said local party leader <PERSON> Sagir </PERSON> <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON>, 39, as he and other activists handed out leaflets saying `` Yes to a Palestinian state'' and `` Long live the uprising.'' His party might gain one seat this year, bringing its total to five, according to recent polls Labor has conducted among Arab voters. The polls were cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newsaper. According to the polls, the Progressive List for Peace would maintain its strength with two seats, while <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> would win 1.5 seats. Six other parties, including the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, would share the remaining four seats, an unidentified Labor official told the newspaper Monday. A 26-year-old <PERSON> Shfaram </PERSON> resident, who would only give his first name, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, said he was not convinced by <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' speech. He also criticized <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> for promising true equality, better schools and more jobs for Israeli Arabs if Labor is elected. `` Every four years they discover that we exist,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a hairdresser. `` They make promises, but nothing changes.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday accused Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of a `` total lack of understanding of our military'' and called the Nov. 8 election a referendum on military policy. The vice president used a <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION> defense plant, where `` Star Wars'' research is being conducted, to launch his latest attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I will not leave <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> defenseless against ballistic missiles,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told about 2,500 company employees in the cavernous assembly plant where Titan IV rockets are built. The vice president made the comments before flying to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he addressed a Jewish group at the Holocaust Memorial in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience that `` the relationship between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never been better, never been stronger. At the <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION> plant, in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing continued ballistic missile flight testing. `` We need to modernize. We need to test. And we ca n't defend <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with blueprints,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. And he scoffed at the Democrat's position on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, or `` Star Wars,'' program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been highly critical of the proposed system _ designed to destroy incoming <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> missiles in space _ but has also said during the campaign that he might support some continued research. Noting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had once called the program a fantasy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked: `` Why spend a dime, if you think it's a fantasy?'' Attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his opposition to new missile systems and for his emphasis on stronger conventional forces has been a main <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign theme. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was planning to introduce that theme in an ad using footage of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> riding around in a tank during a campaign visit to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. Although Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> had no information on a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report Tuesay that the campaign was tentatively planning to spend more than $ 15 million of its $ 30 million-plus advertising in three states, she said three new ads were being aired Tuesday, and a new ad was being shot then. The three states are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared on Monday that with the next century approaching, `` it is all that more important for us to understand the role that our defense has played in securing the peace, the role our military forces must continue to play if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future is also to be secure. `` And this election is a referendum about that role.'' At <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood in a violent thunderstorm at an outdoor rally for the dedication, where he said: `` I am committed to the survival of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has survived, will survive, has flourished, will flourish.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked about the importance of maintaining the `` strategic relationship'' with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and joked: `` I wish that the Lord had given us a little bit of a different weather condition. He works in strange and mysterious ways.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention the controversial effort by the American <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to hold a march in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION> in 1978 in which the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were represented by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> decided at the last minute to hold their march in neighboring <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has frequently criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. Aides said the visit should be viewed reinforcement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism With polls showing the vice president pulling ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ including an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll Monday showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead 55-38 _ Republican strategists say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will focus on a few proven-effective themes such as defense in the remaining three weeks before the election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> donned a bright blue work jacket as he toured the <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION> plant, accompanied by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who has served in Cabinet jobs in both Democratic and Republican administrations. The vice president was shown a simulator for a laser weapon system to be based on an orbiting space station called `` Rapid Retargeting, Precision Pointing,'' or by its facetious code name, `` R2P2.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was told by <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON> that the device was so accurate that it could hit a basketball on top of the Empire State Building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>'s Peak in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director for President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and energy secretary for President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, told the plant employees that `` the presidency is no place for on-the-job training.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's refusal to back new nuclear systems and his willingness to cut two aircraft carriers `` indicates his total lack of understanding of our military.'' `` Governor, it's time to stop running down our defenses,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he favors a `` possible mix'' for a new generation of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles between the Midgetman missile and a rail-based MX missile system _ but not full deployment of both. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign policy adviser, said going ahead with both weapons systems would cost some $ 60 billion, and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to keep the costs of the program to about half that.

 A racial slur uttered in frustration nearly ended <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>'s 27-year career in education. Then her black students stepped in, taught their elders a lesson in tolerance, and saved Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>'s job. `` We were ready to forgive and go on,'' said senior <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, 17, one of six students who initiated, typed and distributed petitions in support of the white librarian. `` Anybody ought to get a second chance.'' After the slur was reported last month, parents in this farming town 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> circulated petitions calling for Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>'s ouster, and she told school officials she would quit. The board promptly endorsed her decision. But then, high school students mounted their own petition drive, the school board rescinded its resolution, and Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON> is here to stay. Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>, who is in her first year here teaching both elementary and high school students, said her troubles began Sept. 27 as she taught her seventh class of the day on using the library at <ORGANIZATION> Gould </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>. As she recalls it, the 20 sixth-graders in the class were n't paying attention and were growing increasingly rowdy In an effort to settle them down, she told the students, all of them black: `` I think you're trying to make me think you're a bunch of poor, dumb niggers, and I do n't think that.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>, 50, said she immediately realized the inappropriateness of the word. `` I opened my mouth and put my foot in it,'' she said in an interview. `` In our part of the country, we call each other hicks and hillbillies and that's OK. But if somebody from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> moves in and they refer to us as hillbillies, we get angry. And I realized that it was wrong. `` I was at my rope's end. I was just trying to get these kids to behave. I was n't even conscious that I was using a word that would offend them,'' she said. Children told their parents about the remarks, and parents went to the school board in this town of 1,670 people, about 60 percent of them black. On Oct. 3, a petition calling for Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>'s dismissal was presented to the board. Many of the 91 parents who circulated and signed it say they remembered routine discrimination and hateful use of the word in their youth. The parents' petition alleged other insulting racial remarks had been made by Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>. She denied that and said her only use of the slur was before the sixth-graders. It was, she told the board, `` a dumb, stupid mistake.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON> recalls that she did n't encounter many blacks while growing up in southern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` That word I used is not part of my vocabulary. My mother would have slapped me across the mouth if I'd said that when I was growing up,'' she said. Overhearing the word in conversations between black students, usually in a humorous context, Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON> concluded she could relate to them better if she used it. `` I had no prejudices. I was going to be one of them and went so far as using a word I should not have used, that I did n't realize would offend them,'' she said. Repentant and tearful, the librarian announced she would quit by the end of that week. The school board endorsed her exit, saying she had lost effectiveness. Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON> was preparing to move out of town with her retiree husband, her career ended, less than three months after she moved to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. On the day before her self-imposed departure deadline, she learned that pupils were circulating petitions asking the board to reconsider. They bore signatures from 124 of the town's 147 high school students, only two of whom are white. Surprised, board members reopened their discussion and reversed the request for Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON>'s resignation. `` It's their school. They're the ones that have to be with her every day,'' said school board president <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON>, who is black. `` We figured this: Why would this woman move to this town with more blacks than whites if she's a bigot? She just made a bad mistake and we decided she deserved a second chance,'' said senior class president <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 17. Mrs. <PERSON> Bostic </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, a lanky basketball center, `` is my hero right now. He came to my defense. It was my miracle.'' Home economics teacher <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON>, one of five blacks on the 13-person high school faculty, praised the students. `` I'm so proud of them. They showed us the way,'' she said. `` I'm encouraged about the future of our little town,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON>, who is white. `` This petition indicates we have 124 young citizens who are good people.''

 The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> has elected <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> its president, making him the second man in the nation to lead a NOW chapter. <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>, who was elected Saturday and lives in nearby <LOCATION> Henryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said he joined NOW because `` their cause covers just about everybody else's causes _ equal rights for everyone, man, woman and child.'' He said he was the only man among 19 women when he attended his first NOW meeting, in 1985. Although the members included him in its work immediately, he said, `` they thought I was a spy. I felt I had to earn my stripes. Within two months, I had brought in 10 new members.'' Former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> NOW President <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Varble </PERSON> said there may be `` a few members who may not be comfortable with the idea'' of a male president, but `` We ca n't cut off half the population.'' Only the chapter in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, has had a male president.

<TEXT>
 Wildfires Sunday threatened centuries-old giant sequoia trees in the state's mid-section and crackled toward homes along the mountain ridges surrounding <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The fires erupted during another <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> fall heat wave with temperatures nudging 100 degrees in many areas and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds, dried and heated by inland deserts, reaching 30 mph. More than 3,500 acres were blackened in the fires, several of them man-caused, authorities said. A wind-pushed 2,000-acre blaze in the Angeles National Forest endangered homes in the path of the flames 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The fire's huge brown smoke plume, rising 7,000 feet skyward, could be seen 50 miles away at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Mountain residents of the northeast <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> were put on alert but no evacuations were ordered. About 200 firefighters were battling the blaze and hundreds more were on the way late in the afternoon. `` This one is giving us real problems,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundick </PERSON>. `` It's going in about three different directions faster than we can corral it.'' About 160 miles northwest, firefighters battling a 600-acre fire in Sequoia National Park were optimistic a buffer zone cleared in a previous controlled burn would save the magnificent trees in the 3-square-mile <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said park spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tweed </PERSON>. The ancient trees are considered the largest living things on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` These are certainly one of the biological wonders of the world,'' Tweed said. `` The fire will inevitably reach the edge of the <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. We think that because of the steps taken, we can prevent it from going into the forest.'' About 100 campers fled the flames, which started at 8 a.m. in <LOCATION> Potwisha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ground </LOCATION> about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION>. A careless camper or angler was the suspected cause of the blaze, <ORGANIZATION> Tweed </ORGANIZATION> said. Another fire 85 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> charred 800 acres near <LOCATION> Hemet </LOCATION>, but firefighters were gaining the upper hand and containment was anticipated by dawn Monday, said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. Two smaller fires erupted in the mountainous eastern portion of the Angeles National Forest. One, started by children playing with matches and a cigarette lighter, destroyed a house.

 A man driving a stolen car led police in four cruisers and two helicopters on a chase he ended at the jail parking lot, authorities said.

 President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> class of 1940, could n't resist some good-natured teasing when <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1962. `` As General <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> occasionally acknowledged <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to be the daughter of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, so I am pleased to come to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, the daughter of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told graduates assembled in the courtyard of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s Old Campus on that sunny June day. `` It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds _ a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> education and a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> degree,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. This year's presidential campaign has elevated what is perhaps the oldest, most intense and most snobbish rivalry in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a new height. For the spoils of this contest will go either to a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> man or a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> man _ only the second time in 200 years that graduates of the two schools have vied for the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And the only other time it happened, in 1912, the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> man, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> man, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, both lost to a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> man, <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. While <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a master at exploiting his <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> education for political advantage, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> class of 1948, has tried to turn Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Harvard connections into a campaign liability. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, scion of a wealthy <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, family, accuses the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, the son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants, of having a `` Harvard boutique'' mentality tainted by `` liberalism and elitism.'' Campaigning Saturday in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want somebody from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> telling me what I can do and what I ca n't do. Asked about that statement at a news conference Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not want to take on the institution itself, asking `` How can I, a nice guy from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, feel that way about <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>? Now come on. `` I'm talking about a handful of people that have served in -LRB- recent -RRB- Democratic administrations that come out of the same liberal philisophy. And they know who they are,'' he said. `` There's an elite inside the elite there.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in turn, has tried to stay out of the Harvard-Yale debate, saying his 1960 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law degree and teaching stint at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> do n't make him a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> man at all. `` I'm a <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> guy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says, referring to the liberal arts college in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> where he received his undergraduate degree. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> line held little sting given his own Ivy League connections. And it probably was lost on most Americans, who view both <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> as elite Eastern universities for the wealthy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aides could n't hold their tongues when outgoing Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, himself a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate, asserted on national television in September that the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> crowd `` with which <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> runs ... think they're smarter'' than most Americans `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spent seven or eight years getting an education in <LOCATION> Massachussetts </LOCATION> and these comments are a clear indication that it did n't do him a bit of good,'' shot back <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, press secretary at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> have eyed each other with haughty disdain for nearly 300 years, since <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1701 by a group of clergy worried about religious backsliding at the more liberal <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, the oldest college in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Harvard was founded in 1636, just 16 years after the Pilgrims landed at <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` We have been natural rivals almost from the beginning,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>, the Larned professor emeritus of history at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, said recently. `` We were the only two with the exception of <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> that you could go to. After that, we both grew in the favor of the Lord.'' The Harvard-Yale annual crew race is the oldest intercollegiate sports rivalry in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, dating from 1852. The schools refer to their annual football contest as `` The Game,'' as if all others hardly matter. Other Harvard-Yale presidential campaigns have been averted only by quirks of history. The 1824 election would have pitted <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> dropped out and threw his support to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who did n't have a college degree. The 1876 contest between <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, against <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> would have been a Harvard-Yale matchup, except <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> after one year and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Although this is only the second head-to-head match, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> both boast presidents among their graduates. While <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> holds the edge in their football series, 56-40, and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> holds the edge in crew races, 72-51, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> holds a substantial lead in the presidential sweepstakes: six <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduates have held the office _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ compared to just two from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a 1941 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, says most Americans do n't give a hoot about the Harvard-Yale rivalry. `` In terms of the mass public, the difference between <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> is nonsense,'' said <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON>, who earned his doctorate at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Few Issues Distinguishing Licht, Chafee In Race For Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>

 Republican Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> admits some people may find it ironic that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Licht </PERSON> is challenging him in his run for a third <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term. The Democratic Licht, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s lieutenant governor, was 20 years old when his uncle, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Licht </PERSON>, defeated <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> in his 1968 bid for a third term as governor. And Licht, who has n't lost an election in his 13 years as a politician, said he has no intention of starting now. But <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, 64, who narrowly won a second <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term in 1982 against former Attorney General <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON> with 51 percent of the vote, said he feels confident as the Nov. 8 election approaches. `` You can never be totally sure as a candidate, but you can tell some things and certainly I think the people appreciate what I've done for them over the years,'' <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said recently <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Republican to be elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, is considered a moderate, and there are few substantial issues separating the two men. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> announced support for a national parental leave bill, a measure backed by Licht in the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Both of the candidates also support open space preservation. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, who has been endorsed by four major national environmental organizations, said he would work to initiate a $ 10 billion federal open space program if re-elected. Licht sponsored several bills last year that led to the state's $ 65 million open-space bond issue <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> has charged that the idea was first his. As the election draws near, the candidates have turned to attacks and the resulting barrage of television commercials has pushed their campaign spending to nearly $ 2.5 million each. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> ran a television ad asserting that when <PERSON> Licht </PERSON> represented the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1984, `` He missed one out of every three votes.'' `` Did he not care? Was he afraid to take a stand?'' the ad asks. `` Or was he too busy doing something else?'' Licht in turn ran two ads that said he has had a 90 percent attendance record in the past six years. He said he missed a number of votes in the early 1980s because of his father's fatal illness and his own role in a lawsuit that overturned a controversial 1982 redistricting plan. Another Licht ad attacked <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> for his voting record on issues concerning senior citizens _ a familiar Democratic tactic nationwide. `` <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> voted 12 times to cut Social Security and five times to cut Medicare,'' said <PERSON> Licht </PERSON>, who has been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>. Polls continue to show <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> in the lead, although <ORGANIZATION> Licht </ORGANIZATION> has narrowed the gap slightly. A poll taken in September gave <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> a lead of 30 percentage points over the Democrat with 59 percent of the vote. A poll taken in early October, with the same 5 percentage point margin of error, showed <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> with 54 percent of the vote, while <PERSON> Licht </PERSON> was the choice of 33 percent of the 400 people surveyed.

 In the modern age of presidential politics, the Democrats have a lot of experience being given up for dead. Generally, it's been a realistic enough presentiment, but <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will surely look for inspiration to several remarkable party heroes. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> are the Mr. Octobers of their era. It was probably <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> foe <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> whom <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was thinking about when he vowed over the weekend to `` go the extra mile'' this month, and added, `` I'm not going to mess up.'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was using <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> as his weekend role models. `` Our party has a proud tradition of closing from behind,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' indefatigable running mate. He told a farmer's market in <LOCATION> St </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, `` I ca n't help but remember <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> out there when the press had written him off.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> came up short, of course, but his 1968 October comeback was still extraordinary, following as it did a divisive primary campaign and a calamitous convention. He sought to succeed an unpopular president _ <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> _ for whom the word albatross comes to mind. But come back he did. After finally staking out some independence from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> put together a high-energy campaign in October and ended with 42.7 percent of the vote, nearly scaring <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> out of his wits. -LRB- <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> ended with 43.4 percent. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> had 13.5 percent -RRB-. Though a sitting president in 1948, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> did n't win nomination until well after midnight, at which time convention managers released a flock of doves to celebrate. The doves, stifled by the heat, promptly dropped dead on the convention floor, prompting one party stalwart to reflect, `` Dead pigeons, just like <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>.'' Except the year did n't end with <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> dead. Unpopular and far behind in the polls, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> invented the whistlestop, making an average of 10 speeches a day from the back of a train and sparing the Republicans no ridicule in that blunt, partisan `` Give ` Em Hell'' manner of his. <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> was no <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>; he stayed above the fray. On election day, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> stood expectations on their head, winning 49.5 percent of the vote to <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s 45 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enjoys the same mid-October expectations as <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, which is to say few outside his immediate family really believe he'll win. But there are differences between the two men, and one is half-tempted to look over at the cerebral and aloof <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and say, `` Governor, you're no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> never had to say, `` I think I'm a reasonably likable guy,'' and if you asked him to name his heroes in American life, can you imagine <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> responding _ as did <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last Thursday night _ `` Some of them are in public life, in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, some of my fellow governors ... are real heroes to me.'' His fellow governors! <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was not a commanding figure. Lots of people looked down upon him, figuratively and literally. `` At first the critics referred to my -LRB- campaign -RRB- tour as a ` one-man circus,' and called it less efficient and less dignified than the campaign being put on by the Republicans,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> said in his memoirs, describing his comeback this way: `` I simply told the people in my own language that they had better wake up to the fact that it was their fight. If they did not get out and help me win this fight, I emphasized, the Republicans would soon be giving the farmers and the workers the little end of the stick again.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> command huddled in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and emerged to tell <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> they would, a la Truman, concentrate on economic themes in the last-ditch drive for a miracle. They mapped out an effort to concentrate on 18 states with 272 electoral votes. That does n't leave any margin for error. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and common sense says you ca n't win every state you contest _ unless you're <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and you're going to win them all anyway By Sunday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had merged his Truman reminisces with a World Series theme, buoyed by the fact that the underdogs from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> had won a first-game victory with the gimpy <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s two-out homer in ninth `` We're going to be like the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> last night,'' he said. `` It looked like they were down and out and all of a sudden they hit a home run and won it. And I think we can do that in the next 24 days.'' Of course this is <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talking, not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>`New' Quayle Is More Accessible But Still Relegated To Safe GOP

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign plane was late taking off one night last week, a reporter suggested a reason for the delay. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, he said, was up in the cockpit giving an interview to the pilot. `` It's the only person he has n't talked to yet,'' the reporter said. When the `` new,'' accessible <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> emerged last week, the contrast with the `` old,'' aloof <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seemed dramatic to those who had studied him since he became the Republican vice presidential nominee. The old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a wooden, programmed speaker who avoided the media at every turn. The new <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has a conversational speaking style and is relentlessly available, engaging protesters and showing up everywhere there is a camera, microphone or notepad. Like a schoolboy given a reprieve from a final exam, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> now seems relaxed, cheerful, confident and, as he put it, `` a lot happier.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's public break with the rigid control of his campaign by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handlers and declaration that `` I am my own handler'' raised skeptical eyebrows among his press entourage. The change still seems one more of style than substance. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is still relegated to campaigning mostly in safe Republican areas or small towns in swing states of his native <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. And he continues to echo positions already propounded by the campaign. But after a week of scrutiny, even the most dedicated skeptics were forced to observe that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did indeed seem to be a changed candidate. Those who have known <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for years say his new style typifies him before he was lifted from relative obscurity to the intense spotlight of a national political campaign. He is quick to challenge protesters who disrupt his speeches, telling them `` You do n't know my record.'' And his speeches are often delivered from notecards rather than prepared texts. Often, they are followed by a chatty question-and-answer session with the audience. With close media scrutiny and the fallout from damaging questions about his military service, academic record and personal life _ it simply took <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> time to decide that it was best to just be himself, aides argue. It is a theory <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> echoes. `` I was just trying to feel my way through this national campaign and what the ground rules were and the expectations are and how best I can serve <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and it's just taken me a while,'' he said. `` Now I know and now I'm off on my own.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> tackled his new role with relish. In fact, his enthusiasm for his self-styled job of `` Dr. Spin'' _ the man who interprets campaign developments for the press _ was such that a sign was posted at the entrance of the press section of the plane reading: `` Spin Free Zone.'' But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came back anyway, again and again. hose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists would be wringing their hands, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters one night as he perched on a the arm of a seat in the aircraft, `` if they knew I was back here now.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says the moment he knew he had to break away came two days after his debate with Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, when he learned of the anonymous sniping from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staffers who viewed him as a liability to the ticket. Angry, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Then he went public, saying he would take more control of his campaign. Aides denied that the whole episode was <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s latest ploy to prop up a weak candidate. What appeared more likely was that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and company had turned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s dissatisfaction into a positive development. Campaign officials in fact seemed delighted at the media attention drawn by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s metamorphosis into an `` in-charge'' candidate. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says that if the strategists `` did n't like what I was doing, I suppose they could find a way to try to stop me.'' `` But ... I think what is happening is that they trust my judgment and my judgment from a political point of view is good,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> denies suggestions of a rift between the two camps. `` We're all together. We're all pulling together for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The new strategy may be risky. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign to date has been noteworthy for those few moments when he did strike out on his own to depart from a prepared text and ended up committing gaffes, such as the time he told reporters, `` I did n't live in this century.'' But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seems philosophical about the dangers. `` You're in a critical position no matter how you conduct yourself and I made a decision on the way I'm going to conduct myself ... and it's going to be entirely different than I did the first weeks of the campaign,'' he said. `` In some respects you can say that it's a higher wire that we're walking on, but it will help <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I am convinced of that,'' he said. `` That's my judgment and I'm very comfortable with it.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Record of Budget-Balancing In Massachusetts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been variously described as draconian and innovative in his fiscal policies as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but the record suggests he met the bottom line in balancing nine state budgets through good times and bad. Criticism lingers about how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned a $ 360 million revenue shortfall into a $ 67 million surplus in the fiscal year that ended June 30. And doubts remain about whether the current $ 11.6 billion budget _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 10th as governor _ will be in balance when fiscal 1989 ends next June. But even as those concerns leave the lips mostly of a small <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> minority in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and find their way onto the national scene in the rhetoric of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential opponent, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, non-partisan experts continue to show confidence in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy and the governor's management of state finances `` There are n't many financial analysts that listen too closely to politicians; we've been -LRB- deceived -RRB- too many times by them,'' said bond analyst <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON>, senior vice president with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In a report this past week, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bond rating service, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's, said it `` expects the state to continue to achieve sound financial results.'' Earlier this year, S & amp; P gave <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> its second-highest bond rating, AA-plus, marking the state's first upgrading since 1984. Another major bond rating agency, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said last month when the commonwealth went to market with $ 250 million in long-term bonds that the state's `` budgets for both fiscal 1988 and fiscal 1989 have been balanced.'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, which also upgraded <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' rating to its second-highest level this year _ the first such increase since 1975 _ noted that the state has `` little financial leeway'' in balancing fiscal 1989. But it said, `` Indicators suggest that the underlying economy continues to be among the strongest in the country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, most recently in his Thursday night debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, picked up on one small component of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' package for balancing the fiscal 1988 budget. He accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of raiding the state's pension fund reserves of $ 27 million <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied it. In fact, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tapped $ 27 million in pension funds he determined to be surplus after meeting immediate state obligations to the system of about $ 560 million in fiscal 1988. More than half the $ 27 million went to a teachers' pension account and the rest to pay a general fund shortfall. State <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> back into session last week, contending the fiscal 1989 budget is as much as $ 1 billion out of balance. <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> based his assumption on the slow rate of new revenue generated in the first fiscal quarter. Revenues for the period were up only 1.2 percent over a year ago, while the state needs a 8.3 percent annual rate to balance the budget. But the first quarter results were affected by a $ 68 million payout in corporate abatements stemming from a tax break the Legislature has now closed. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration contends revenues will rebound this year through a variety of new specialized tax increases, such as levying the sales tax on cigarettes; increased tax auditing practices and ending certain tax breaks. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, president of the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, is not so confident. The foundation estimates a shortfall of $ 180 million to $ 220 million. However, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said that is manageable if the administration demonstrates the same discipline it showed in fiscal 1988. The budget problems the state faced in the past fiscal year resulted mainly from unexpected changes in taxpayer behavior due to federal tax law changes, particularly affecting capital gains. As a result, final revenue growth for the year was 2.1 percent compared to a budget expectation of 6.6 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was able to balance the books on fiscal 1988 principally through the largest planned reduction in spending ever attempted in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Some $ 233 million was systematically trimmed, primarily by delaying the start of new programs. The policy caused disappointment among advocates but little reduction in existing services. The administration also shifted about $ 185 million in construction projects scheduled to be paid from general funds to long-term bonds. In the fiscal 1989 budget, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proposed in January before all of the problems surfaced in fiscal 1988, he cut about $ 200 million in new and expanded programs while the Legislature was still debating the bill and vetoed or delayed spending over $ 200 million more when he signed it into law. He also won passage of several new revenue sources: the $ 33.7 million cigarette sales tax; $ 75 million from income tax updating; $ 180 million from new tax enforcement; and $ 40 million from corporate tax changes. In 1975, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inherited a deficit that slowly grew to $ 560 million out of a budget of $ 3.8 billion. It forced him to slash spending for general relief and state employee pay raises and finally to sign an income surtax, the biggest broad-based tax in the state's history. The actions contributed to his defeat four years later and gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the basis to label him a tax-raiser. Re-entering the governor's office in 1983, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inherited another deficit projected to reach $ 300 million. This time, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> legislators urged him to go for another big tax increase, but instead he pushed for smaller spending cutbacks and a major crackdown on uncollected taxes. The year ended with a $ 41 million surplus.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has opened its first venereal disease treatment center to handle the rapid rise in VD cases, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said today. The report said the capital will grant $ 13,500 to the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venereal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and plans to set up other district centers to combat the growing health problem. It said 427 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents last year were diagnosed as having gonorrhea, syphilis and other types of VD. VD is said to be most serious in southern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most open areas bordering <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The province recorded 5,600 cases last year, triple the previous year. Venereal disease was a scourge of 20th century, pre-revolutionary <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, especially in the cities, where prostitution and opium trafficking ran rampant. After the communist takeover in 1949, Chinese doctors launched a campaign to cure venereal disease _ placing prostitutes in re-education camps and treating victims. By the 1960s, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claimed to have virtually wiped out the diseases. But the problem returned in the 1980s with the nation's opening to the outside world Lack of education about the diseases, and lax enforcement of the ban on prostitution, are also blamed for the spread of VD. The daily said the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> center opened with an exhibition of pictures and videos focusing on the symptoms, means of infection and harm caused by VD, and on sex and family life. About 100 people, mostly in their 20s and 30s, visited the exhibition during its first two days.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, with little left on his agenda but to keep the White House in Republican hands, is relishing his high-profile role in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. As he attends to the business of signing legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in its waning days, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is continuing to stump for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in key battleground states. He'll take his `` peace-and-prosperity'' message into the heart of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> this Wednesday, and will increase the campaign pace after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns, possibly this week. `` I think the president's thriving. He's enjoying himself. He thinks he's making a difference,'' White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said recently. By all accounts, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s role in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bid for the White House has gone through an evolution in recent weeks. The president has stepped up his appeal to the so-called `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats'' in <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> and Northeastern states, whereas it was once thought he would play a smaller role. `` I was of the impression that they -LRB- the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign -RRB- were going to say, ` Go carry <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,''' said Democratic consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>. Some inside both the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had said early on that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign activities would likely be focused on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, his home state, and on southern and <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been immensely popular, even during his hard times. One Republican strategist, discussing the changing campaign route on grounds of anonymity, said it was decided that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should focus on the key battleground states where there are large numbers of ethnics, conservative Democrats and independents. And so <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has spent recent weeks in such places as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Some of the places where the president is strongest have just solidified for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... much faster than we expected,'' said this Republican. `` So the question became, do you want to go to a state where you're 20 points up. ... It obviously makes more sense to look at the other states that are close.'' `` I think the role is just right,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>. `` You're sending your biggest guns into the biggest battles, and there's no surrogate bigger than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, the Democrat, acknowledged that the strategy of having <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> follow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into states the vice president has visited recently has been helpful to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> cause. `` They have had a marvelous campaign where they have integrated the message themes very well,'' he said. Besides making campaign appearances for his vice president _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will likely put on a full-court press in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, for example _ the president has used the trappings of his office to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s benefit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> frequently works a pro-Bush pitch into his official chores, such as bill-signings, whenever he can connect the vice president to the situation at hand, and throws pro-Bush statements into his weekly radio addresses. Perhaps <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s all-out campaign for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can be traced to conversations that both the president and <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> had with former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> is known to believe that the lukewarm support given him by President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1960 contributed to his loss to Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. In an interview, <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said that `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and I spoke several months ago, and I asked him to give his historical perspective _ what <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> did and did n't do for him,'' and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> entertained <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for a private White House dinner. The chief of staff said in an interview that because of these and other factors, `` I think it's fair to say that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has campaigned for his vice president in an unprecedented manner.'' <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> agreed with that. `` What they have is an extremely commanding voice that can get himself heard any time he wants to, day or night, and it's just awfully handy to have someone who can do that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Voracious Ducks Damaging Fish Farms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fish farmers do n't believe their crops are for the birds, but try telling that to a hungry duck, blackbird or heron. `` Birds are a costly problem where fish are cultured,'' says researcher <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in a new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` Waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of fish at aquacultural facilities include diving ducks, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, kingfishers, blackbirds, ospreys and anhingas.'' These birds _ the diving ducks include grebes, cormorants and mergansers _ were described as `` voracious fish eaters'' that not only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to fish stock. `` Due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the fish they consumed are diseased, predatory birds may transmit diseases from pond to pond,'' she said. Moreover, when fish farmers attempt to guard against the airborne marauders, they can be frustrated because a majority of the birds are legally categorized as migratory and are protected under federal and state laws. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, worked as an intern for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> the last two summers. Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by fish species and location, she said losses to birds have been reported on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical fish and trout, and are greatest in the largest aquaculture states: <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the summer,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers, herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late summer and early fall.'' She added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to shellfish, although swans occasionally are problems. `` Catfish in the Southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas -LRB- locally called water turkeys -RRB- and kingfishers during the spring and summer months,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` Herons and cormorants cause problems year-round. Crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by purple grackles, herons, egrets, ibises, gulls, diving ducks and kingfishers.'' Fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as perimeter fencing, netting, overhead wires and other devices, including fireworks, exploders and similar items used to frighten birds. Some chemicals, such as Avitrol, a registered `` frightening agent'' for use on herring gulls and blackbirds, have also been effective, she said. But state and federal permits are required to use this chemical on gulls, because they are legally protected. After ingesting the chemical, the gull `` will behave erratically and emit distress calls,'' which frighten away the other birds, she said. Some migratory game birds may be shot during the hunting season, and other permits are available for some species. Local state and federal wildlife authorities should be contacted. Still, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, some fish farmers believe `` birds are uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile, no matter what method of control of prevention is used.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has decided to renew an advisory panel in hopes of out-thinking or out-maneuvering some of the `` depredating animals'' that cause losses to farmers. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said losses to farmers from blackbirds, rodent and coyotes _ which were named as examples _ are estimated at more than $ 300 million a year and `` often represent the difference between profit and loss'' for many producers. In recently announcing the renewal of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Damage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the panel serves as a public forum so that ranchers, farmers and wildlife interests can have a voice in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> policies on animal control.

 Researchers say Southern poultry farmers could save an estimated $ 7 million a year by using softer, lower-power lights in their broiler houses. High summer heat makes chickens go off their feed, so producers keep broiler houses lighted during the summer nights so the birds will eat during the cooler hours, says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said farmers traditionally use 75 - or 100-watt bulbs because they want to simulate actual daylight `` But our tests show that broiler chickens more than two weeks old eat normally and gain just as much weight under 25-watt bulbs,'' he said in a report released here by the agency. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>, who works at the department's <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poultry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> said the annual savings `` could amount to $ 7 million across the South, or about $ 1,000 for a typical producer who raises about 160,000 chickens during the summer.'' The tests also showed that chickens under the dimmer lights `` waste less feed energy in fighting, running around and chirping,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congresswoman Calls House Civil Rights Compliance Long Overdue</HEAD>

 Few were as surprised as Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> when her six-year fight to extend civil rights protection to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> employees finally paid off. `` Six years we'd been fighting for this! Sometimes, you'd feel like you were banging your head against the wall,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` So I really did n't expect it to happen the way it did.'' To the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>'s surprise, members agreed overwhelmingly this month to end what she calls `` the ultimate irony,'' their self-enacted exemption from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. `` To impose a law, as we did, and then totally exempt oneself is a kind of hypocrisy that should not have continued this long,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recognized this, finally. It's about time.'' The chamber approved a compromise offered by Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., banning discrimination on the basis of race, age, sex, religion, handicap or national origin in the hiring and employment of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee and staff employees The measure taking effect Nov. 3 also establishes an Office of Fair Employment Practices to hear discrimination complaints, mediate disputes and penalize <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who violate the law. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> blamed the lack of progress _ until this year _ on resistance from `` a handful of old dons who run this place like they had their own little fiefdoms and do n't want it to change.'' `` That's probably true,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said Friday. `` There are older members on both sides of the aisle who resisted ethics reform, too, when it happened a few years ago. On the other hand, they've been around long enough to know changes are inevitable. This one was.'' The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lawmaker began her campaign for the civil rights legislation in 1982, when a study she requested found inequities between the salaries paid to male and female employees on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Although she complained about the disparity to colleagues, Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said a follow-up survey in 1984 showed little change. She introduced a bill in January 1985 to require <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the federal judiciary to comply with the Civil Rights Act. The bill died in subcommittee. Last May, after a third study found a continuing gap between pay for men and that received by women and minorities, she submitted the bill again. This time, it bore the names of more than 100 co-sponsors. The action finally approved Oct. 4 on a 408-12 vote amends <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules to prohibit discrimination by members. The exemption to the civil rights law still applies to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the judiciary. However, lawmakers agreed under the compromise to consider Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s proposal again in June with an eye to creating a statute that would cover all congressional and judicial employees. Although 12 members voted against the measure, aides said the votes did not necessarily mean they disagreed with its intent. `` The boss went in planning to vote for it,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> VanHoose </PERSON>, the administrative assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky. `` His opposition was purely symbolic `` He is completely in sympathy with <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. He just did n't think the compromise went far enough, because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' record is n't too impressive when it comes to regulating itself. <PERSON> Tish </PERSON> <PERSON> Brink </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican `` objected because he opposes regulation generally.'' Meanwhile, Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said she has started getting `` some fallout'' from members who voted for the change but have reservations about it. For example, an aide said one complained that eliminating the Civil Rights Act exemption would force him to fire some female employees because he had more women on his staff than men. That concern is unfounded, Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure there is a down side to this somewhere,'' she added. `` I'll get the blame for any problem, there's no question about that. But occasionally, you do the right thing. This one, I've got no regrets on.''

 The 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> plans to adjourn this week once it clears its desk of unfinished business including a campaign-year attack in the war on drugs. The fate of dozens of bills lies in the balance as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> begin what both sides agree will be the last week of the two-year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The biggest of the bills is a massive anti-drug package passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill is n't as tough on drug users as one passed earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and negotiators from both bodies will be meeting to try to resolve the differences. If they agree on a single package, a final vote will be needed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before it can go to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for enactment into law. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators were bogged down on another major legislative package _ so-called technical corrections to a 1986 tax bill. In addition to making technical corrections to that bill, the proposal included selected new tax reductions, the tax increases to pay for them, and a `` bill of rights'' for taxpayers facing enforcement or collection action from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Differences in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the bill were so sharp that negotiations broke down Friday and an aide to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators said `` whether the conference gets back together at all again is very much up in the air.'' On the other end of the priority list were bills ranging from legislation designed to assist individual people, nominations of federal judges, water projects affecting specific cities and states and a plan to end the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' trusteeship over the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island nation of <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION>. Yet another bill that could make it under the wire would elevate the Veterans Administration to Cabinet-level status. The fate of each of them was up in the air as members, already in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a week or two longer than they had hoped, strive toward an adjournment that will let them go home and campaign for re-election. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told senators on Friday that `` I certainly would hope we would n't have to stay beyond But nobody can predict that.'' The House returns from a long weekend on Tuesday with a scheduled vote on legislation that would require full disclosure of credit card information to consumers. The bill, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week, requires that banks, department stores and other companies that offer credit cards tell consumers about annual fees, interest rates, late fees and other information. Currently, only a few states have laws requiring public disclosure of such information before consumers receive the cards. Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the measure `` one of the most important and strongest credit disclosure acts that we have been able to move through the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the first truth-in-lending statute was passed 20 years ago.'' Also pending is legislation providing first-ever restrictions on lobbying by former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, part of a general tightening of federal rules against influence peddling by top government officials. The legislation has passed both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in different versions and a compromise will have to be worked out before it can win final approval and be sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The bill covers not only lobbying, but any communication done for pay to influence government decisions, including writing letters, filing motions or granting requests. It would prevent members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and senior staff members, for one year after leaving office, from contacting the legislative house in which they served. The restrictions also would apply to lobbying for pay by anyone from the president and vice president on down through the top several thousand executive-branch policy makers.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can count on solid backing Nov. 8 from the nation's former spies, who are making no secret of their support for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate. `` This is 99 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> country,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Houkal </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official attending a two-day annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Former </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend. In the tightly knit intelligence community, former spies feel a kinship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who served as the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s director for a year in 1976 in the Ford administration. President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the Democrats regained the White House. The association does not formally take stands on political issues, but it is n't difficult to determine most members' allegiance <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Treher </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> who worked in counterintelligence, said he feared that Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, if elected, would put `` liberal restrictions'' on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. He said that could result in the `` greatest disaster'' in intelligence-gathering since the so-called Church committee, the congressional investigation that revealed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had tried to murder foreign leaders and destabilize governments. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> found the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> reeling from the committee's revelations. The consensus among several ex-spies was that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boosted the agency's morale in his short tenure by going along with the recommendations of the professional staff and interfering little in their work. Houkal that he was involved in a policy change and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` just signed off on it.'' `` It was a tranquil operation,'' added <PERSON> L.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirito </PERSON>, who now works for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admirer from those days.'' Despite his hands-off management style, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> formed some close ties at the agency, including one with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, an ex-CIA man who has served as one of the vice president's top foreign police advisers. Like others, <PERSON> Houkal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will probably `` leave the agency alone'' if he moves to the White House. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief, was appointed to head the agency after <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s friend, died in May 1987. One reason the former sleuths want to see Republicans remain in control of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is their belief that intelligence agencies have prospered during the last eight years. Several present and former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials praised <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> for beefing up the agency and improving its analytical capabilities. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> deputy director, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also has helped the agency by boosting its appropriations in the last decade. Congressional review of the intelligence process `` has given a growing number of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> an idea of what we really do for a living.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said he worked closely with <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> on arms control issues, and the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> head never leaned on staffers to play with the facts so they jibed with policy views. `` He kept his fingers off intelligence,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatner </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> had strong, forceful views that may have prompted the analysts to self-censor their product. `` His personal views tended to have an impact,'' she said. She noted, however, there is always a tension between analysts and policy-makers because the facts never fit squarely with the views of those who formulate policy. `` The news from the analysts is usually bad,'' she said. <PERSON> Boatner </PERSON> was critical, though, of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>'s book, `` Veil: The Secret Wars of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> 1981-1987.'' The book describes how <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> committed the nation to new and expanded covert wars in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` I know things in the book that are true and I know things in the book that are dead wrong,'' she said. Since the early 1980s, the analysts said, gathering and interpretation of information has improved. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has invested heavily in equipment to collect facts and in training analysts. `` The nation had made a pretty spiffy investment in people,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. Among other things, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has sought more experienced analysts, expanded their training and tried to improve their work by giving them more time to travel and take sabbaticals. `` They are a promising lot,'' <PERSON> Boatner </PERSON> said of the new breed of analysts. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said the agency is doing `` as well if not better than we ever have'' in recruiting with about 150,000 inquiries a year. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> entertains about 1,000 serious applications a month. Still, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has problems recruiting specialists such as `` world class chemists and nuclear engineers.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Greaney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AFIO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, said 250 people attended the convention, up from last year. The association, which has a membership of over 3,000, is dedicated to promoting strong intelligence operations.

<HEAD>`No-Fault' Libel Trials Recommended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major study of libel laws today recommended sweeping changes designed to resolve disputes quickly through `` no fault'' trials deciding the truth of disputed statements. No damages would be awarded in such trials. The changes were proposed by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, after a study begun last winter by 11 lawyers, judges, journalists and others. `` Libel suits tend to drag on interminably, are enormously costly for both sides and very seldom clearly resolve what ought to be the heart of the matter: the truth or falsity of what was published,'' said the report of the Libel Reform Project. A major change from current law in the proposal would be elimination of the requirement that public figures suing for libel prove that defamatory statements about them were published with `` actual malice,'' that is, with knowledge that they were false or with `` reckless disregard'' of whether they were false or not. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Minow </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, summed up the advantages of the new procedures this way: `` The plaintiffs in a no-fault trial get a quicker verdict on whether they were defamed or not and, if they win, get their attorney's fees paid by the other side, but they give up a shot at money damages. `` The news media on the defense get relief from the chilling effects of huge, emotionally based damage awards, but they give up the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> protections that have restricted libel rulings.'' Times vs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was a 1964 case in which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to award damages to a public official without a showing of malice. As it stands now, `` the present law is not adequately protecting the reputations of people who have been defamed. And it's not protecting journalists' freedom to report _ vigorously and fairly _ the truth as they can best determine it,'' <PERSON> Minow </PERSON> said. Here are the main changes from current law incorporated in a model statute recommended to the states and federal government: _ No suit for defamation could be filed unless the plaintiff had been refused a prompt retraction or chance to reply Retractions or replies for candidates for office would have to be made before a coming election. _ All such suits would have to charge that the defendant made a false factual statement that was defamatory _ tended to injure the plaintiff's reputation Such a lawsuit could not be smuggled into court under another name, such as invasion of privacy. _ No one could sue over statements of opinion, such as an editorial cartoon In determining what is fact, courts could consider the extent to which a statement could be proved objectively and the extent to which exaggeration for rhetorical effect was intended. _ Most trials would be for `` declaratory judgment,'' with the loser paying the legal costs of the winner Such trials would have to begin within 120 days. The only issue would be the truth, according to the judgment of the jury or, if the parties agree, the judge. _ A conventional trial for money damages could not be held unless both sides agreed, and even then damages would be limited to the plaintiff's actual loss _ there could be no punitive damages However, the loss might not be all financial _ a plaintiff could be compensated for humiliation, for instance. _ The plaintiff would have the burden of proof _ the duty to show by `` clear and convincing evidence'' that the disputed statement was false _ The mere repetition of statements about matters of public interest could not be the subject of a lawsuit if the originator were identified, and there could be no inquiry into the state of mind of the defendant This would be a major change from current law, which generally treats repetitions like original statements. _ There would be no distinction between slander, which is oral defamation, and libel, written defamation There would be no distinction between news media or other defendants. _ The current exemption for statements made in official legislative, judicial or administrative proceedings would be retained

<HEAD>Astra Satellite Could Change European Television</HEAD>

 This small bucolic nation hopes to change the television landscape in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with the launching of its <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> satellite on Dec. 9. An Ariane rocket of the European space consortium is to send <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> into orbit and if the project is successful millions of viewers will need only satellite dishes the size of an umbrella to receive TV broadcasts without paying for the service. <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION>, the project of <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europeenne </ORGANIZATION> des Satellites, will be the first one capable of beaming a package of 16 channels directly to homes in the most densely populated areas of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Programming scheduled so far is to be financed through advertising revenues. Low-power satellite signals now require big and expensive dishes. These signals are primarily distributed by cable networks that charge the viewers, limiting the audience. But the medium-power <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> will beam channels directly to homes that will require only a dish costing about the same as a video recorder. `` A medium-power satellite was most suited to mass market TV, and <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> will be the first of its generation,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Santer </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the early 1980s we realized much was happening in the audiovisual media,'' he said. At that time the broadcast monopolies of European governments began to fade with the advent of cable TV and the prospect of continent-wide satellite broadcasts. `` We took our chances to push through innovations,'' <PERSON> Santer </PERSON> said of the Astra project. `` All of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is still virgin territory for television.'' The <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> government initiated the Astra project in 1983. It has a 20 percent share in the <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europeenne </ORGANIZATION> des Satellites, which has $ 85 million in capital, and has agreed to cover risks of up to $ 125 million. Eight of the 15 other shareholders are <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> companies and the satellite's control center is in <LOCATION> Betzdorf </LOCATION>, 13 miles east of the capital. <PERSON> Santer </PERSON> hopes <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> will generate income for the nation from new TV productions. `` A satellite is only a transmission tool. We must also produce programs. That's the second important factor,'' he said. Parliament is expected to enact a law soon giving tax breaks for audiovisual enterprises to set up shop in this nation surrounded by <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Santer </PERSON> expects this will lure producers of situation comedies, variety shows and other projects that are cost-efficient and carry relatively little commercial risk. With <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> and its related TV production initiatives, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> has its sights set on 1992, when the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> plans to forge a single European market for its industries. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has estimated satellite television will generate $ 11 billion in business for makers of reception dishes, decoders, other equipment and advertisers over the next five to seven years. `` Why can we not succeed where the Americans were so successful?'' said <PERSON> Santer </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> must put a greater effort into TV technology and programming.'' Despite such lofty European ideals, <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> is a U.S.-made RCA-4000 satellite and the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> company has signed its first contract for four channels with media tycoon <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen. Through Astra, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> will target a market of over 80 million homes in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It will give areas not served by cable companies and limited to only a few national networks more choice. <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION>'s key markets are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. Viewers in many other nations will be able to tune in, but with a larger dish. While many competitive satellite projects are still on the drawing board, <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> is to begin transmissions in early 1989. The organization has signed a 10-year contract with <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for his entertainment unit Sky Channel and movie, sports and news channels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media magnate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is negotiating for a channel, sources said on condition of anonymity. But too many English-speaking programs would dent the European goal, even though each one can be received in different languages, according to <PERSON> Santer </PERSON>. `` We must diversify,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 With South African troops out of southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says his <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas face a tougher military struggle but have gained support in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Guerrilla officers promise few prolonged battles of the kind that <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and South African forces waged early this year in the siege of Cuito Cuanavale. Angolan government units were temporarily driven out of the southern town, they say. But, eight months later, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is back in defensive positions east of Cuito, awaiting an enemy campaign. The departure of several thousand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> soldiers seven weeks ago, as part of regional peace negotiations, `` has weakened our position,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said in a recent interview. But he said the South African move has bolstered <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility as an independent force and has increased diplomatic pressure on the Angolan government to negotiate a settlement The declared goal of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> _ is to force the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> into a power-sharing arrangement leading to national elections. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> expressed confidence that <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, relying on traditional guerrilla advantages of speed and surprise, can maintain the stalemate in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 13-year civil war. `` We can not come out without wounds. But we can sustain some wounds,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` For sure, <PERSON> Jamba </PERSON> will never fall,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> bush </PERSON> headquarters in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` They will pay such a heavy price _ I think they will not try.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> says it has 37,000 guerrillas and 28,000 regular soldiers, nearly half as many as the government's more heavily armed 80,000 soldiers and the 50,000 Cuban troops on its side. Negotiations involving <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are aimed at an agreement by Nov. 1 for a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal. In return, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would allow implementation of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> independence plan for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The Marxist Angolan government `` can not stand alone without the Cubans,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said during the interview at an unmapped forest supply camp near <LOCATION> Mavinga </LOCATION>, about 80 miles from forward <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> positions. `` African countries are giving much more sympathy since the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> left,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. He named <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> as sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s cause. He said liberal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Democrats, Sens. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, told him during a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year that the main barrier to their understanding `` was the direct involvement of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' `` Now we are working very well,'' he said of the Democrats. Brig. <PERSON> Peregrino </PERSON> <PERSON> Chindondo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s intelligence chief, said guerrillas caused serious Cuban casualties and burned eight Cuban vehicles in a raid Oct. 6 on a convoy near the central highlands city of <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION>. He said 25 vehicles were seized Oct. 3 when <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> took <PERSON> Sanzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pombo </PERSON> in the northern <LOCATION> Uige </LOCATION> Province. `` The morale of the enemy is very bad,'' <PERSON> Chindondo </PERSON> said. `` Most are recruited in round-up operations. There is friction with the Cubans. They have lost the support of the people.'' During an 11-day tour of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> bases in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where the movement effectively governs one-third of the country, reporters visited a guerrilla command post 3 miles from enemy lines at Cuito Cuanavale. There they talked with Angolan prisoner of war <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Wango </PERSON>, 25, a few hours after he was captured in a skirmish. Wounds on Wango's head and elbows were bandaged. He was barefoot and <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> officers said it was customary to remove prisoners' boots so they could not escape. <PERSON> Wango </PERSON> said he had fled his village near <LOCATION> Ganda </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, to avoid military service but was caught by a government squad in a cornfield in March. `` They beat me and told me I was a crook for trying to escape,'' Wango said. `` They gave me three months' training and made me a sergeant.'' `` In the army, we do n't have any food, no breakfast. People are weak and fall while on duty,'' Wango said. `` The only ones getting good food are Cubans. `` Once I ran away to another brigade to trade beads for something to eat. They found me and put me in confinement for five days.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 jetliner with 51 people aboard crashed early Monday in heavy fog short of the runway of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main Leonardo da Vinci airport. Police said 29 people were feared dead. Twenty-two people survived Flight 775, said <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Iovinella </PERSON>, director of the airport police. The flight was en route from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, with an intermediate stop in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iovinella </PERSON> said 44 passengers and a crew of seven were aboard the jetliner that crashed at 12:31 a.m. -LRB- 7:31 p.m. EDT Sunday -RRB-. However, <PERSON> Gatwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hangling </PERSON>, agents for <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> airport, said there were 45 passengers and a crew of seven. The discrepancy could not be immediately resolved. The aircraft skimmed the tops of some trees, then crashed, broke into pieces and burst into flames about a half-mile west of the runway, police said. The airport is 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The charred hulk of the airliner lay smoking in a muddy field early Monday while firefighters raked through the debris. Two bodies covered with sheets lay near the shattered aircraft. Seat cushions, boxes, a makeup case and a twisted doll were scattered nearby in the mud. The front of the jetliner was a charred skeleton of a plane. The fuselage was snapped where it joined the wings and the cockpit section was broken into hundreds of pieces. The airline's distinctive red and yellow stripes along the scorched fuselage could barely be seen <PERSON> Iovinella </PERSON> said 23 survivors had been taken to nearby hospitals and that the rest of the people aboard were believed to be dead. Fifteen of the injured were taken to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ` </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eugenio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>; others went to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camillo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ostia </LOCATION> A police officer at Sant ` <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an unidentified <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> woman was dead on arrival at the He said the injured, who were being treated for burns and fractures, included 12 Ugandans, six in grave condition, and three Britons. The Britons were identified as <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatt </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> and their 2-year-old son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. Their hometown was not immediately availabale. Police said they did not immediately know the nationalities of the others aboard the flight. <PERSON> Iovinella </PERSON> said the cause of the crash had not been determined. But the entire area along the <LOCATION> Tyrrhenian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> near the airport had been shrouded in a heavy fog. `` It was definitely the fog,'' said one police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, when asked about a possible cause of the crash. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the tower gave permission for the plane to land and reported a visibility of 4,920 feet. It said the tower called the plane again when it did n't respond. Moments later, it said, workers saw a big fire at the end of the runway. Firefighters took nearly an hour to put out the flames. Authorities closed the airport to traffic shortly after the crash and diverted all incoming flights to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ciampino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, which normally handles mostly military and charter traffic.

 About 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers brandishing jacknives and broken bottles brawled with rock-throwing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> in the capital's shopping district. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and a South Korean were hospitalized, officials said today. News reports said one American and three Koreans were injured in the clash early Sunday, and one of the Koreans was in critical condition. According to a military press release, the incident in the nightclub section of Itaewon was sparked by a verbal altercation between a Korean taxi driver and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier. The argument escalated into an assault involving four Americans and a number of Koreans. Itaewon is a a shopping district close to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces Korea Headquarters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. South Korean police officials said the four Americans suddenly began cursing at the taxi driver, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ok-Chul </PERSON>, 51, and kicked his cab on a street corner. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was quoted as saying that when he got of his car and protested, the Americans punched him in the face and some even climbed on top of his car. The officials said about 40 Koreans rushed to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s aid. The Americans then fled, brandishing empty beer bottles and throwing rocks at the pursuing crowd. When Korean passers-by jeered at the fleeing Americans, police said about 40 other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers joined in and brandished jack knives and broken beer bottle at the Koreans, who countered by throwing rocks. The Koreans, whose number had swelled to about 200 by then, shouted `` Yankee go home,'' in front of a nightclub into which the Americans had fled, the officials said. About 200 police who arrived at the scene dispersed the crowd of Koreans. The four unidentified soldiers involved in the initial altercation were booked for investigation and turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> miltiary authorities, the police said. Officials did not release the names of the injured and it was not immediately clear when the injuries occurred.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> discharged more blood today but his condition remains stable, officials said. The crown prince and other members of the imperial family meanwhile attended an annual harvest festival. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, discharged a small amount of blood `` on several occasions'' Sunday night through this morning, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told palace reporters. The world's longest-reigning monarch, who has discharged small amounts of blood since Saturday, was given a transfusion of 0.84 pints of blood Sunday, bringing the total he has received since vomiting blood Sept. 19 to 17.4 pints. The transfusions were administered to help the emperor combat anemia and supplement blood lost in internal bleeding, according to palace officials. The rite, called Kannamesai, includes offering prayers in the direction of the Ise Shrine, where the sun goddess is worshipped, and presenting sacred offerings at a small shrine on the palace grounds, according to palace spokesman <PERSON> Chifuru </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashizawa </PERSON>. `` The Kannamesai is an imperial festival giving thanks to the gods by offering newly harvested crops,'' <PERSON> Ashizawa </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Slaughter Puts Focus On Rancher-Wild Horse Competition For
Rangeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The slaughters of at least 450 wild horses have brought into focus a long-running conflict between the mustangs and ranchers who both depend on the state's rangeland for survival. Officials discovered the first mass slaughter in August when 41 carcasses were spotted by helicopter near <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Since then, other major finds include discovery of about 180 carcasses on Oct. 8-9. Officials estimate that the horses had been shot between two years ago and early this summer. `` What we have here is the kind of carnage that indicates an all-out war against the wild horses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said last week. <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> officials refuse to comment on whether they have any suspects or leads. <PERSON> Delloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterthwaite </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged speculation that the gunmen were ranchers who have grown tired of the beautiful but destructive animals `` I'm as shocked as anyone about this,'' <PERSON> Satterthwaite </PERSON> said. `` But it's true, ranchers do n't like them. The -LRB- horse -RRB- population is out of control and something has to be done or they'll ruin it for everybody.'' Ranchers consider the mustangs pests because they drink scarce water, graze land used to fatten livestock, and tear up fences. But others consider the wild horse a last vestige of the Old West. Champions of the horses also say they are the closest thing left in this country to pure mustangs, the horses brought here in the 1500s by <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> conquistadors. Foes say the animals have little or no such blood. The 1971 Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act sought to reconcile the interests of both sides. The act declared the mustangs protected wards of the state and made their killing a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $ 2,000 fine and one year in jail. The law also allowed the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> to round up some horses for adoption or placement in sanctuaries to control the size of the wild herds and prevent overgrazing. Some ranchers say the control efforts have failed. According to estimates, the number of mustangs on the nation's ranges has grown from about 17,000 in 1971 to about 40,000 now, of which about 28,000 are in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> alone. `` When they passed that law, they promised they would control the population,'' <PERSON> Satterthwaite </PERSON> said. `` They did n't fulfill that commitment.'' The situation may get worse before it improves. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> announced it was ending its free mass adoption program, which waived a $ 125-a-head adoption fee for anyone taking 100 or more horses. Animal rights activists had argued that the program allowed people to make a profit by selling adopted horses to slaughterhouses to be used for dog food, glue or other commercial purposes. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> still allows people to adopt up to four horses a year for $ 125 each and is seeking to build sanctuaries that could serve as places for people to view the animals. `` The wild horse may have some historical value to some people but it does not serve mankind like cattle or sheep,'' <PERSON> Satterthwaite </PERSON> said. `` They should be treated like deer. When the herd gets too large, they have a hunting season on does. I'm not saying kill the horses, but control them.''

<HEAD>Gulf Ministers Ready To Raise Production Ceiling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHIHRI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and its partners in the six-nation <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are ready to raise <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s overall production ceiling to try to stabilize prices, according to a statement released today The move, made public following a meeting of the council's oil ministers Sunday, appeared to defer to neighboring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in giving it the same quota as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Emerging from their 8-year-old conflict, both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have said they will need to pump as much oil as they deem necessary to finance post-war reconstruction projects. The council set one basic condition for the higher ceiling: adherence by all <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members to any production levels agreed upon. They also called for cooperation by oil producers outside the cartel. The ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> called the meeting to try to forge a joint strategy to help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> prop up oil prices, deteriorating due to a market glut. The press statement, carried by the official Saudi press agency, said the council members `` affirmed their quest to stabilize the world oil market on condition that this be the position of the other oil producers inside and outside <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' It said the council states were ready to follow an overall production ceiling of 17.429 million barrels per day for the 13 members `` or any higher ceiling upon which agreement is reached within the organization.'' The 17.429 million barrel figure seemed to give <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> parity with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s quota of 2.36 million barrels per day. The current ceiling for the 12 nations without <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is 15.06 million barrels per day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s quota under the 1986 agreement was 1.54 million barrels. The statement did not clearly state that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was getting a higher quota and no one could be reached for clarification. The statement also said any quota increase would be distributed in the same ratios as the current quotas. Members have been pumping at least 3 million barrels per day over the agreed on production ceiling. The call to increase the ceiling appeared aimed at gaining some control over the market, even if falling short of the $ 18-per - barrel price that the current ceiling was supposed to bring Oil was trading at around $ 8 below that mark in recent weeks. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> has ignored its limit and is producing at the rate of 2.7 million barrels per day. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> tried to produce above its quota but damage to its facilities during the war kept it pumping at its assigned level. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has suggested it will cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliamentary speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said Friday that there was `` no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coast of the gulf'' over the oil market The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> also publicly renounced its quota, producing 1.5 million barrels daily as opposed to the 948,000 barrels sanctioned by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> announced it would no longer cut production and sacrifice its revenue to defend prices. It has overshot its quota of 4.3 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure the overproducers into respecting the quota system. Four of the six council members _ <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> _ are ranking members of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. The two others, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, are not <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members but their economies depend on oil export revenues.

 People kept calling to buying cocaine, the folks answering the phone kept saying come on over, and the arrests kept mounting.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said today he will present a peace plan for the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula when he addresses the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> left today to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for the first time as a South Korean head of state. Prior to his departure, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a news conference he will unveil a new policy of unification between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and a `` northern policy'' aimed at improving relations with communist countries such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has been trying to improve relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other communist countries hoping that it would have a positive effect on reunfication efforts. These communist countries have so far been allies of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, although some of them, such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, recently agreed to exchnage trade offices or permanent missions with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The capitalist south has no diplomatic ties with any communist country. Following the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> address <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to lunch with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday. Those talks will also focuss on Korean peace efforts, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials said. South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are not <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members, but the world body has decided to hear speeches from both. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sok </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju </PERSON>, speaks Wednesday. The two Koreas have been bitter enemies since their land was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They still are technically at war, since no peace treaty was signed after the Korean War in 1950-53 ended in an armistice. The two Korean states have held rapprochement talks on an off since the early 1970s but failed to make progress. Lawmakers of both sides began talks in August with little progress. One senior government party official, requesting anonymity, said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s speech may cover some sensitive matters, including arms reductions by the two Koreas, which <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials have so far been reluctant to discuss openly. In his latest peace proposal early this month, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> renewed a call for summit talks with North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, and said he is ready to end rivalry and confrontation. `` Circumstances affecting unification have changed completely from the past,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said in a major policy speech two days after the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics ended Oct. 2. The president said the Olympics, which attracted athletes from a record 160 countries, including most communist-bloc nations, have enhanced <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s stature in the international society and boosted chances for improved relations with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Improved relations between East and West and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are also creating a favorable environment for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> to thaw 40 years of icy relations, he said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said his government was drafting a new unification formula, which he said `` should be practicable and acceptable to both sides.'' Observers in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> think <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> may drop hints at or even outline <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s new unification formula. Not surprisingly, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s recent peace initiatives have received cool response from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which always prefers a quick lump-sum political settlement of issues to gradual, step-by-step approaches being pushed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. But, in what appeared to be somewhat encouraging development, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> conditionally welcomed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposal for an inter-Korea summit, according to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials. In its first official response to the proposed summit, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said Saturday it would welcome <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> only after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has repealed its staunch anti-communist system and agreed to tackle political and military matters first. One thorny issue is a North Korean demand for withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in the South. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> maintains that no thaw in relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would be possible as long as the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops remain.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> urged the public today to await details before judging a new agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, but lawmakers said the government had accepted too little money. Groups opposed to the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops branded the agreement a `` sell-out,'' and one senator said he hoped the agreement would respect a Philippine ban on nuclear weapons in its territory. Another senator said an unsatisfactory agreement will speed up legislation requiring the Aquino government to give <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> notice it will close the six bases when their lease expires in 1991. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday, Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to pay $ 481 million annually and back a bond program to help ease the country's foreign debt as part of a lease agreement for the bases. Philippine sources said <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> originally asked for $ 1.2 billion over two years for use of the two largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases abroad _ <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Base _ and four smaller installations. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> gave him a `` go signal'' to sign the pact in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today. Cash payments would be a big increase over the current $ 180 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and economic aid attached to the bases, but less than half that sought by the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> when talks began in April. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was asked by reporters today whether she considered the talks successful. `` Why do n't we just wait until all the details are laid out and expressed by Secretary <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>,'' she said. The left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denounced the agreement as a `` sell-out'' and said <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> should not have linked the continued presence of foreign troops to the debt issue. Party spokesman <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Agcaoili </PERSON> said the two issues should have been negotiated separately to strengthen the Philippine bargaining stand. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the reported agreement `` is a confirmation of the fact that it seems that this administration is not ready yet to stand up to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` would be inclined'' to begin debate on a proposal filed months ago by majority leader Sen. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> to serve notice that the bases will be closed in 1991. Without such notification, <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> said the bases agreement would be automatically renewed. The new Constitution requires that any extension beyond 1991 be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where anti-bases sentiment is strong. But Rep. <PERSON> Gualberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumauig </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, termed the agreement `` welcome news'' because it would mean more money for the country as it tries to cope with a $ 28 billion foreign debt. The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> opened 4.54 points higher today than Friday's close of 725.52. Traders said the increase was due in part to reports the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> reached a bases agreement. Sen. <PERSON> Wigberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON>, a leading bases opponent, said financial compensation was not the only issue. `` I do n't think it is enough to settle the issue of compensation if the threat of national destruction due to nuclear weapons and the derogation of national sovereignty is still there,'' <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON> was chief sponsor of a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year which would ban nuclear weapons from <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and the four smaller installations. The legislation is pending in the House. The agreement would cover only the final two years of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, which expires in 1991. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to say whether she will support extending the agreement, which runs out one year before her term expires.

 The government appears to be on a campaign to discredit the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, over the church's use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds. But the main issue seems to be the government's determination, now that it feels it has defeated the U.S.-backed rebels militarily, to stop the flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds to groups opposed to or not supportive of the leftist Sandinista regime. Conservative estimates by political opposition sources in the capital <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> say more than $ 50,000 arrive from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> monthly. The Sandinistas argue that most of the money comes from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> even if it is distributed by labor, church or other groups. On Saturday, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and Nicaraguan bishops of becoming `` instruments of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s politics of death'' by accepting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds At the center of the controversy with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is the role of the cardinal as one of the two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> agreed upon by the Sandinista government and the rebels, known as Contras. The duty of the commission is to confirm that the two sides are following the peace accords tentatively approved earlier this year. The other commission member is <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or OAS. The tentative peace accords specified that <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would be under the control of <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> would pay for expenses, but to speed things up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agency for 1nternational Development agreed to provide the $ 10 million needed. <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Curia </LOCATION> spokesman Monsignor <PERSON> Bismark </PERSON> <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON> explained that nearly $ 1 million of the funds would be used by the church to acquire equipment and pay salaries of members of local verification commissionss set up by the church in cease-fire areas. The issue came to light a few days ago when the government-controlled news media accused <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo of trying to bring in, duty-free, 17 four-wheel vehicles and a similar number of generators reportedly to be used by the local verification commissions. Assistant Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said there is nothing the local commissions can verify since there was no concrete agreement between the government and the Contras. `` What are they verifying?'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> asked last week, adding the gpvernment does not recognize the cardinal as being in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. According to the original accords, the commission would verify the movement of the Contras into safe cease-fire areas, withdrawal of Sandinista troops and the eventual disarming of the rebels and their return to civilian life. The talks broke down in June, with both sides announcing unilateral cease-fires. The local verification commissions were to be made up of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops in the cease-fire areas and people they appointed as well as foreign representatives named by the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general. <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> has remained quiet during the controversy, and currently the commissions have only those members named by the church. Church officials say they feel the commissions are also charged with verification of respect for human rights and `` democratization'' in the cease-fire areas. `` We know what they are doing,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. Church officials acknowledge the commissions have gathered information harmful to the government. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said any funds for the <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> `` may be suspended until the government and the commission reach an agreement on the way the commissions will work.'' Church officials said privately they feel the government may be trying to force <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo to step down as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The cardinal angered the government Oct. 9 when he publicly criticized it for rejecting humanitarian aid approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Rioting broke out among hundreds of gate crashers at an overcrowded soccer game that had been blacked out on local television. One person was killed and 50 injured, police said.

<HEAD>Pledge Of Allegiance: Socialist Wrote It, Flag-selling Magazine
Published It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has portrayed <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> as a hotbed of left-wing intellectuals who do n't respect rituals like the Pledge of Allegiance. But scholars say the pledge was born here. What's more, the Baptist minister generally credited with composing it was a socialist. `` Most people do n't know anything about the history of the pledge ... and if you tell them, they do n't want to believe you,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, who has written two books on the subject. The Pledge of Allegiance was surrounded by controversy and hucksterism after it first appeared in a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, The Youth's Companion, on Sept. 8, 1892. The magazine had pioneered the sale of subscription `` premiums,'' such as school uniforms and silver tea services. But it achieved its greatest commercial success, and its enduring legacy, with a drive to put a flag in every school. The flags were priced at $ 3.30 to $ 13, depending on size. To help schools raise the money, the magazine provided `` flag certificates'' that pupils could sell for 10 cents apiece. The magazine urged schoolchildren to prepare to celebrate the 400th anniversary of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' voyage to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the next month, and even published a suggested ceremony, most involving a flag. Sandwiched between a presidential proclamation and an ode to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, both long forgotten, was the original pledge: `` I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it stands: one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' At the words `` my flag,'' the students were instructed to stretch out their right arms to the flag, similiar to the Nazi salute. It was not until 1923 that the words `` my flag'' were replaced by `` the flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' out of concern that immigrant children might think they were pledging allegiance to their native lands. Thirty-one more years passed until `` under God'' was inserted at the the behest of President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, who said that `` in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war.'' The original version of the pledge was unsigned. But once it had caught on, competing claims to authorship quickly emerged. One group pushed for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Upham </PERSON>, an editor of The Youth's Companion The other favored the Rev. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>, who had served as pastor of two <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> churches before joining the magazine's staff. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and some other scholars say <PERSON> Upham </PERSON> was the author. But two formal investigations _ by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag Association in 1939 and by the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1957 _ concluded <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> was responsible. That is now the dominant view, even though <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> was a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION> and once gave a lecture entitled `` Jesus the Socialist.'' According to his daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, he left the ministry `` because he felt the church was n't doing enough to help the working man.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which he belonged to, wanted to nationalize chunks of the American economy but have them controlled at the municipal level,'' said researcher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` He did not practice or preach violent overthrow of the government by any means.'' Controversy over the pledge erupted during the 1988 presidential elections when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized his Democratic rival, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for vetoing a 1977 bill that would have mandated that teachers lead the students in the Pledge the beginning of every school day. That was n't the first controversy surrounding the Pledge. In the 1940s, <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses objected to reciting it in schools, saying it violated their religious principles of pronouncing allegiance only to God. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> initially rejected their arguments, ruling in a 1940 case that public schools could expel children who did not recite the pledge. Then, in 1943, the court reversed itself and said children could not be compelled to pledge. Meantime, <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses had been the targets of attacks in dozens of communities. In <LOCATION> Richwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for example, members of the sheriff's department and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> forced seven members to drink large quantities of castor oil, then tied them together and paraded them through town. `` <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> was an avid fan of saying the pledge,'' said <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, `` but I ca n't imagine how he would have felt about it if he had lived to see the mob violence of the'40s.''

 A man wanted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for allegedly carrying out a string of sex slayings wo n't be returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soon even though he faces extradition proceedings, his lawyer has predicted. Hearings will begin today to determine whether <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, currently serving a 4 -LCB- - year jail sentence here for armed robbery, should be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> But <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s Calgary-based lawyer, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, said it could be a long time before his 27-year-old client heads south. If <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> loses the case, there will likely be an appeal, he said. <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in December 1985 after a botched shoplifting attempt in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> in which a security guard was shot in the hand. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants Ng back to face 25 felony counts in <LOCATION> Calfornia </LOCATION>, including the murders of 12 people. Eleven of the deaths involved grisly sex slayings at a rural cabin in <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The other murder case involves the death of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> disc jockey, and other charges include burglary, kidnapping and false imprisonment. Ng, a native of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and a former marine, came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after his companion, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, was picked up for shoplifting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and committed suicide. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> later was linked to the deaths or disappearances of 22 people. That investigation led to the charges against <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>. If extradited and convicted, Ng faces possible execution in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has a policy against extraditing anyone facing the death penalty, but the final decision will ultimately rest with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hnatyshyn </PERSON>. The hearings, which are being held to determine if there is enough evidence to send <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are expected to last up to five weeks. Not all evidence will be available to the public. Madame Justice <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Trussler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>'s Court of Queen's Bench ordered in May that anything said in open court could be reported but the courtroom would be cleared when certain sensitive material was discussed. Among observers at the hearings will be some family members of <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s alleged victims, who were given financial aid by the Edmonton-based Victims of Violence for their trip. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellitto </PERSON>, whose 39-year-old brother <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosner </PERSON> is one of <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s alleged victims, said she wanted to see the accused killer for herself. `` I want to hate him in person,'' <PERSON> Sellitto </PERSON> said recently from her <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> home. She plans to attend the hearings. Allegations of torture and mass murder in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> deaths have caused many to question <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s extradition procedure. As recently as May, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> urged Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> to speed up the process. In a letter, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said denying the extradition `` could have the unfortunate consequence of making <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> a haven for death penalty fugitives.'' But <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s Calgary-based lawyer, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, predicted it could be a long time before Ng heads south. Regardless of the outcome of the extradition hearings, he said, there will likely be an appeal.

 The average small investor has prospered since last October's market debacle, continuing to reap gains on assets not hurt by the crash, a magazine reported. During the past year, the average small investor's portfolio has grown 12 percent to $ 77,031, Money magazine said in its current issue. That's well above the 9.1 percent annual return that has averaged since 1970. What cushioned small investors in the face of Black Monday was the fact that more than 68 percent of their money was invested in assets not directly affected by the plunge in stock prices. When <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 20.4 percent on Oct. 19, 1987, the average small investor lost only 6.6 percent, Money said. And while the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P index was off about 22 percent in the fourth quarter, the small investor's portfolio declined by just 4.9 percent before bouncing back this year. According to the magazine, money funds and certificates of deposit represent 45.3 percent of the average portfolio, while stocks make up about 28 percent. As stock prices fell, money funds and CDs continued to yield 6 percent to 8 percent a year. In addition, bonds and bond funds, which make up 23.1 percent of the average portfolio, rose in value as interest rates fell in the fourth quarter. According to the magazine, the small investor benefited from the steady performance of those assets as well as from rebounding stock prices and equity funds.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> wrote in his diary that he'd love <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> until he died, and recounted that he once bought her a $ 1.1 million ring after he told her her hands were `` large and ugly and red and masculine.'' The late Welsh actor also wrote that he was `` as thrilled by the English language as I am by a lovely woman or dreams.'' In the journals, he analyzed his relationship with <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, detailed the fairy-tale life they lived, and fretted about the financial cost of diamonds and the physical cost of drinking. Excepts from a biography, which quotes from <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>'s journals, are published in November's Life magazine. The book, `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>: A Life 1925-1984,'' by <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> married in 1983, will be published by Little, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in February. `` I have been inordinately lucky all my life, but the greatest luck of all has been <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> wrote on Nov. 19, 1967. `` She is a prospectus that can never be entirely catalogued, an almanac for Poor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>.

The next morning, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> replied that <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> would have to buy her a diamond ring of 69 carats to make her hands less ugly. `` That insult last night is going to cost me.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> wrote. He ended up spending $ 1.1 million for the ring. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> worried about <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s drinking and his own. `` It would be frightful to live the rest of our lives in an alcoholic haze, seeing the world through fumes of spirits and smoke.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> said today he wrote a letter to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> three years ago and that the letter was now bearing fruit. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> revealed at the beginning of a meeting with Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> that he had entrusted <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> with the letter, apparently calling for an improvement in Sino-Soviet relations. `` You can see the letter you carried three years ago has achieved results,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said to the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> president as they posed for photographers. `` It's happening later than we thought, but do n't worry.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> also repeated his prediction, made in talks with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> last week, that `` it is possible that next year there could be a summit.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> molestation case was billed as the nation's largest when it was launched five years ago with seven defendants and 41 alleged young victims. Now, the shrunken case is remarkable for its longevity and the bitterness it has left among those who have been touched by it. The only remaining defendants are <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 30, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, who taught at the now defunct <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> preschool founded by Mrs. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON>. The Buckeys face 65 charges of molestation and conspiracy, down from an original 115 counts. The alleged victims have dwindled to 11. The trial has consumed 1 -LCB- years and wo n't end for months. The defense, which has called <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> `` an American hero'' victimized by the news media and claimed children were coached into alleging molestation, begins presenting its case this week. The trial followed a preliminary hearing that lasted nearly two years. `` The case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> declared last week. `` By that I mean every witness, every litigant and every judicial officer. It's a very upsetting case.'' Two witnesses have died, one by suicide, the other from an alcohol-related disease. <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> has attributed both deaths to pressures of the case. `` We never envisioned that it would last this long,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Philibosian </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> district attorney who filed the case. `` It's absolutely a travesty of justice for the children and parents that the case would last this long.'' He blames a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law giving a defendant the right to a post-indictment preliminary hearing and a municipal court judge who, he said, did n't limit that pretrial proceeding. <PERSON> Philibosian </PERSON> also criticizes his successor, District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>, for waiting until the end of the preliminary hearing in 1986 to dismiss charges against five former teachers. <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>, who had said evidence against the five was `` incredibly weak,'' has declined to discuss the case until the trial is over. The chief prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, says the trial has been worth the effort and its $ 10.5 million cost. She said the testimony of nine children who took the stand and medical evidence showing `` significant genital scarring'' in seven of those children helped her case. `` I can think of many other things I might rather have done over the last 4 -LCB- years. But you have to have a more global perspective. If nothing else, the public is now more aware that these kinds of things have occurred and unfortunately continue to occur,'' she said. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, says his client is `` an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hero'' who has endured a media blitz that declared him guilty. `` The case was lost when I was hired,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` If I read the newspapers and did n't know <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, would n't I have thought he was guilty?'' <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, who was 25 at his arrest, has been held without bail and marked his 30th birthday in jail. His mother, free on bail, reports to court every day, usually clutching her knitting and a Bible. The children's allegations included teachers touching their genitals, urinating on them and forcing them to have sex with animals. Rabbits were mutiliated to scare the youngsters into remaining silent, the children said. The defense, which has contended that the children were coached or coerced by a social worker or their parents to allege molestation, has managed to whittle down the case. Last week, the judge agreed to a prosecution request to drop 27 charges based on claims of abuse by three alleged victims who failed to testify. The prosecution claimed they were too traumatized to appear in court: the defense said they were deliberately excluded because their planned testimony lacked credibility. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> expresses confidence his client will be cleared. `` The message for <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> is big men come out of big mistakes, and this -LRB- case -RRB- is a big mistake,'' he said.

 Small planes are flying tons of food to thousands of starving civil war refugees, but relief officials say fighting and flooding will keep help from reaching hundreds of thousands in remote areas. Twin-engine Cessnas on Sunday flew some of the 90 tons of food to about 40,000 people jammed into <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION>, 500 miles southwest of the capital, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. The $ 1 million U.S.-financed airlift began Thursday and is to last 10 days. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wannop </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Development Program in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, said officials visiting <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION> in the past few days said the emaciated southerners were too weak to prevent scavenging hyenas from dragging away the bodies of relatives at night. The refugees left behind their crops and cattle to escape a civil war between the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, fighting for economic and political reform since 1983 and claiming to control 90 percent of the southern countryside. The group, demanding autonomy for the Christian and animist African south from the Moslem-dominated government in the north, has shot down relief planes because they say the flights may be military-related. <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION> is just beyond the reach of the fighting. Western relief officials say the airlift to <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION> is tiny compared to the extent of devastation facing hundreds of thousands of others in less accessible areas. <PERSON> Wannop </PERSON> said that in the past five years of the civil war, about 2 million southerners fled their homes to camps and shantytowns in southeastern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, central and western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and around the capital of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. He said 150,000 people fled to the western region of <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION> is located. A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeks before the impact of the supply mission could be felt. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eight to 10 people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatment and a long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day. An estimated 80 people a day died in the area's refugee camps in July and August, the worst months in a summer that some relief officials say took up to 10,000 lives. They said most were the elderly or young children. <PERSON> Wannop </PERSON> said a possible explanation for the lower death rate was that all the younger children had already died during the difficult summer months. The Sudanese Red Crescent says <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION>'s population of 10,000 has swelled to 40,000 by displaced people. Sudanese officials say the Western agencies are exaggerating the number of refugees throughout the south and that the government has drawn up a plan to supply relief to about 224,000 people. `` The people affected by the famine and starvation are moving northward,'' said <PERSON> Haj </PERSON> <PERSON> Tayeb </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s acting commissioner for relief and rehabilitation. `` We reached some of them and gave them aid.'' The government earlier expelled several Western relief agencies for allegedly working with the rebels to get supplies to stranded southerners. Heavy rains and floods in August have exacerbated conditions for the southerners and hampered efforts by Sudanese and foreign relief agencies to help them. Relief food and medicines last reached <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION> in June, before Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government halted relief operations during the rainy season, when the guerrilla war intensified. Rebel gunners shot down two relief planes in 1986 and 1987, killing more than 70 people.

<TEXT>
 An art dealer imprisoned for tax evasion was cleared of charges that he humiliated and tortured a teacher for six hours during a sado-masochistic homosexual encounter. The state jury acquitted <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> of kidnapping, sodomy, assault and coercion because members believed the teacher had agreed to the ordeal, said juror <PERSON> Ara </PERSON> <PERSON> Derderian </PERSON>. The jury, which reached its verdict on the sixth day of deliberations Sunday, deadlocked on a charge of unlawful imprisonment. The district attorney's office was considering dropping the charge. <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON>, 43, had denied the charges by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, a 28-year-old college English teacher from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> who said <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> and four young men imprisoned and brutalized him in <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> gallery on Sept. 20, 1984. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasanof </PERSON> called the verdict `` protection for everybody's liberty.'' He noted that <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> met <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> admitted he liked getting hit and feeling `` a little pain'' during sex and paid the check when he went out to dinner with <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> after the encounter. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidemann </PERSON>, who described <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> during the trial as `` a master manipulator'' who `` deals art by day and torture by night,'' said simply, `` The jury has spoken.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> newspapers published his name, address and photograph, denounced the verdict in a statement. `` My purpose in bringing this charge was to prevent <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> from beating, torturing or killing other young men,'' the statement said. `` Justice -LRB- <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> -RRB- Atlas' rulings throughout the trial and the subtle bias of his charge to the jury make a profoundly disturbing statement. In our society it is acceptable to brutalize and even murder gay men.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> testified at the trial but was not present for Atlas' instructions to the jury He had testified that he had two sadomasochistic encounters with <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> and snorted cocaine with him. At the second encounter, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> said, he was attacked at the gallery against his wishes and left bleeding, crying and handcuffed. He said he expected some rough sex but did not consent to being tortured. `` <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> did not protect himself by saying there's a limit to what I'm willing to do,'' said <PERSON> Derderian </PERSON>, a 60-year-old architect who was the only juror to talk to reporters after the verdict. `` There was a mistaken idea of what each side meant by domination.'' A key prosecution witness was <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> LeGeros </PERSON>, 26, who pleaded guilty to attempted kidnapping in exchange for his testimony against <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON>. LeGeros is serving 25 years to life for the sadomasochistic murder in February 1985 of <PERSON> Eigil </PERSON> <PERSON> Dag </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesti </PERSON>, 26, a Norwegian fashion student and model. <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> was implicated but never charged in Vesti's death. Vesti's body was found on the estate of LeGeros' parents. After seeing news naming <PERSON> LeGeros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> went to the police. <PERSON> Crispo </PERSON> has served 2 -LCB- years of a five-year federal prison sentence for tax evasion and is eligible for parole, according to his attorney <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>.

 The dollar opened sharply lower against the Japanese yen today but recovered some of the loss before closing time, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> eased slightly. The dollar closed at 127.20 yen, 1.05 yen lower than its close Friday. It began trading today at 126.30 and moved in a wide range of 126.25 and 127.50 yen.

 Men who found themselves barred from staying at their girlfriends' housing project homes because of a curfew on visitors say they may have to get married to beat the ban. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> instituted the ban last month and employed guards around the clock at the Rockwell Gardens development to reclaim the building from marauding gang members. Residents who are on the lease must show housing authority identity cards to enter and leave the 138-unit building on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. Visitors must leave by midnight, and that includes men who live with their girlfriends.

<TEXT>
 The plane crash that killed President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and 28 others was not an accident, according to a U.S.-Pakistani report. But officials said the exact cause may never be known. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> air force Cmdr. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON>, who released a summary of the report Sunday, said the Aug. 17 crash of the Hercules C-130 transport plane may have been caused by a small explosion or the pilots may have been drugged or intentionally crashed the plane. But the lack of a black box voice recorder and the inability to perform autopsies on the bodies of the pilots is hampering investigators from concluding just what caused the plane to go down, he said. The 365-page report ruled out mechanical failure, said <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON>, who gave a 27-page summary to reporters at a hastily called news conference. `` After a thorough analysis of the available evidence, the board has been unable to substantiate a technical reason for the accident,'' said the report by four Pakistani investigators and six <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officers. `` In the absence of the technical reason, the only other possible cause of the accident is the occurrence of a criminal act or sabotage leading to the loss of aircraft control and the -LRB- crash -RRB-,'' it said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials received a copy of the report and `` we are studying it.'' She made no further comment. All 30 people aboard the plane were killed, including <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>; a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense adviser, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON>; and five top Pakistani generals. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> said eyewitness reports and a test of debris ruled out the possibility the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile or suffered a powerful mid-air explosion. But he said a smaller explosion remained a possibility. He said witnesses reported the aircraft pitched violently for about two minutes before making a nosedive. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> also said lab tests of the debris showed unusually large quantities of chemicals used to make explosives, including phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, antimony and pentaerythritol tetranitrate. He said investigators assembled a detonator from the same chemicals found in the debris. The report noted phosphorus was found on mango seeds in the wreckage. Earlier reports speculated an explosive device was hidden in a box of mangos offered as a gift and placed aboard at the last minute. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> did not comment on the theory. Among the scenarios <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> suggested were that the flight crew was drugged, causing them to lose control. But he said that due to the condition of the bodies no autopsies could be performed to test that theory. The drugs could have been hidden in a gift package or beverage cans, <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> said the phrase `` criminal act'' referred to the possibility that the pilot or co-pilot could have disrupted cockpit controls intentionally, causing the crash in an open field. Because there was no voice recorder aboard the aircraft, he said, it was impossible to determine what the crew said before the crash. The plane originated in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> watched a demonstration of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> M-1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> battle tank. The four-engine turboprop crashed after takeoff on the return flight from <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION>, 330 miles south of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, 64, was a military strongman who imposed eight years of martial law during his 11 years in power. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> objected to his support of rebels fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> fought three wars with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is committed to holding elections Nov. 16 for a new leadership.

 Unseasonably heavy rains flooded much of western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, forced about 45 people to be evacuated from homes and campgrounds, and stranded two hikers shivering under a tree for a night. `` We had just about lost hope. We thought we were going to die out there,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsel </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was hiking with his 30-year-old brother, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>. Rain tapered off and floodwaters were receding late Sunday in the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> foothills east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, but more rain was predicted for tonight and early Tuesday with the approach of another storm system, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The Winsels were trapped in the <LOCATION> Vesper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peak </LOCATION> area about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Sultan </LOCATION>, a town of 1,500 residents 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The brothers were dressed in boots and jackets and had some food, but said it was icy cold and only one of them had gloves. `` We were awake all night shivering,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsel </PERSON> said. `` In the morning, we tried to return on the logging road, but we found the -LRB- <LOCATION> Skykomish </LOCATION> -RRB- river had risen overnight and had wiped out the road in three places.'' The only bridge they found was impassable, so the brothers had to swim across the river, where they were picked up by a truck driver and taken back to <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>. `` We probably would n't have been able to survive if we'd have stayed outdoors another night,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsel </PERSON> said. `` We'd already spent 24 hours in hell.'' The Skykomish crested in Sultan on Sunday three feet above flood stage, Fire Chief <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowlton </PERSON> said. About 15 residents had to be evacuated by boat from the town Sunday morning, according to <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a dispatch supervisor for the <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday night. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers fed 30 people and arranged for emergency housing after evacuating them from trailers in the <LOCATION> Snoqualmie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campground </LOCATION> on Sunday, said relief worker <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>. The contents of two or three trailers were believed destroyed, she said. The Skagit and Stillaguamish rivers also reached flood stage at upper elevations Sunday, the weather service reported. A flood warning for the <LOCATION> Nooksack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was canceled late Sunday. The floodwaters closed numerous roads throughout the Cascade foothills. No damage estimate was immediately available.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Lash Midwest, Southwest; Flooding in Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Thunderstorms that lashed the nation's midsection and the Sunbelt with hail and high winds weakened early today, while unseasonably heavy rains in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state caused flooding that forced dozens of evacuations. Showers and a few thunderstorms extended across western <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> into central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> early this morning, but there were no reports of severe weather since dime-size hail pelted northeastern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Sunday. In western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, another storm system was expected to bring rain tonight and early Tuesday. Flooding on Sunday prompted the evacuation of about 45 people from homes in <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and a campground in <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. No damage estimates were immediately available while the waters of the Snoqualmie, <LOCATION> Skykomish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION> and Stillaguamish rivers were still receding late Sunday.

 Doctors said they kept a dead man's heart beating for an hour in a successful test of a drug designed to prevent blood clots, but an ethicist is questioning the experiment's technique. `` It raises such fundamental issues that it needs to be explored before you can call it right or wrong,'' said ethicist and physician Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. La <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION>'s editorial accompanies the medical report in the current issue of the Annals of <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Centocor </ORGANIZATION>, a Malvern-based pharmaceutical company, said the test successfully prevented the man's blood from clotting during the hour-long experiment. The drug, called 7E3, also did not cause excessive bleeding, one possible side effect of two commonly used anti-clotting drugs, heparin and warfarin. Researchers used a portion of a single-cell antibody to block the clotting. Such antibodies are often called a `` magic bullet' because they seek out a specific cell Blood clots can cause strokes or heart attacks, such as when they travel to the brain or pulmonary arteries. The experiment was conducted on a 78-year-old man at the <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> hospital by researchers led by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coller </PERSON>, a hematologist at the university on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Relatives of the man, who had been in a coma from a brain hemorrhage, and the hospital's <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> gave permission for the test. The man had been placed on a respirator so that his heart would continue beating during the experiment. The article did not say when the experiment was conducted. `` The advent of a specific treatment such as the antibody, without causing side effects, would be a very welcome and important addition to available therapies,'' Dr. <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Mondhiry </PERSON>, a hematologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and a researcher in anti-clotting agents, said in a telephone interview. In his editorial, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> wrote that the experiment was `` ethically questionable,'' and added that the report did not outline details regarding informed consent that he considers essential. He noted the researchers received consent from the hospital and were not the ones to contact the patient's physician to ask for consent. The newly dead should be considered for such experiments only when the work is of value to physicians treating patients, rather than basic biological research, said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION>. La <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> said he found three reported instances of scientists experimenting on newly dead patients this century. <PERSON> Coller </PERSON> said using a newly dead patient allowed the investigators to study the effects of several doses of the treatment. Using live volunteers would have increased the time necessary to complete the study, he said. `` In our setting, the experiment provided us important information that was potentially useful in benefiting humans, without exposing a living human to harm,'' <PERSON> Coller </PERSON> said in a statement. The experiment will also provide data for prospective volunteers in clinical studies, the article said. <PERSON> Coller </PERSON> said the patient's physician notified the researchers that the patient could be eligible for the study. <PERSON> Coller </PERSON> said nine years of prior research at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> had shown that the agent 7E3 prevented blood from clotting in test tubes, monkeys and dogs, and models designed to simulate impending strokes and heart attacks in humans.

<TEXT>
 Pro-government newspapers today hailed President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> as a rousing success although no agreements were announced and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declined to divulge details. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> returned Sunday following a 10-day trip, the latest in a series of foreign journeys aimed at easing the country's diplomatic isolation. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> attended the funeral of Bavarian governor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, then went to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> where he met with bankers and businessmen. En route back to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> stopped briefly Saturday in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> met with Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, and in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON>. According to the French news agency Agence France-Presse, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> made a brief statement in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, saying his conversations with Houphouet covered African problems in general and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in particular, but he did not elaborate. `` It is always a privilege to meet him,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said of Houphouet according to the AFP report. `` We did n't want to pass by without stopping in this country of goodwill.'' None of the officials who met <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> have issued public statements regarding the talks. The <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> stopover marked <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s fourth visit to a black-ruled African country since mid-September. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declined to discuss the specifics of his talks with <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest-serving leaders. `` We discussed matters concerning <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and especially southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. We decided not to make statements,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s recent travels have focused world attention onto <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` At a time when one might have expected the world to demonstrate an obsession with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidential election, the spotlight has instead been turned on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said today in an editorial. The Afrikaans-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> said: `` What clearly began as a visit to pay homage to a dead friend -LRB- <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> -RRB- turned into a noteworthy trip. ... Perhaps these moves could be followed up by one or two dramatic developments internally that will show the world that we are earnest about reform.'' The newspaper suggested the government could release jailed African National Congress leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and scrap pending legislation designed to strengthen the Group Areas Act, which segregates neighborhoods by race. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s travels herald a `` fundamental change'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s relationship with the rest of the `` By the end of last week even the most hardened cynics were having to concede that a new spirit of conciliation was abroad,'' the <ORGANIZATION> SABC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who has held power since 1978, never held a summit meeting in a black-ruled African nation until he traveled to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> last month. He also has visited <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> in recent weeks. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says Presidents <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> are likely to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in coming months. The Citizen, quoting unidentified government officials, said there was a `` possibility'' that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would meet with Angolan President <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in August withdrew its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they fought alongside the anti-Marxist <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators, have been attempting to negotiate an agreement on the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Angolan government and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the territory ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreigners captured after entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with Moslem guerrillas have been caught up in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government's effort to win international credibility. As the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s troops withdraw after nine years of helping the Afghan government fight the guerrillas, the quest for peace is increasingly pursued on the political front as well as the military one. Winning recognition as a legitimate government is a key part of the political campaign. Two Turks who joined the Afghan guerrillas and a West German doctor and nurse who were working in a guerrilla-controlled area are the latest pawns in this game _ all four are being held in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Pol-e-Charki Prison. Most Western nations have refused to recognize or deal with the Afghan government since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 1979 intervention that sent more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to bolster the Soviet-style regime. Afghan officials have made it clear the Turks' prison terms could be shortened if President <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> appeals to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> for clemency, according to a diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Turkish government has refused to do so on the grounds that humanitarian issues should not be mixed with politics. Appeals addressed to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> resulted in the freedom of a French journalist and an Italian photojournalist 4 -LCB- months ago. The two men had been convicted of espionage and of entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> illegally. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were criticized by some of their Western allies on the grounds the appeals constituted de facto recognition of the Afghan government. The Turkish and West German prisoners were accused of entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> illegally from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. They four have been visited in prison by representatives of their governments. One of the Turks, <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Uzel </PERSON>, 22, was captured in 1984 and is serving a 16-year sentence. The other, <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Demir </PERSON>, 24, was captured in December 1987 and is serving a 20-year term. Both were convicted of illegal entry and espionage. West German doctor <PERSON> Benno </PERSON> <PERSON> Splieth </PERSON> and nurse <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackstedt </PERSON> were captured Sept. 8 and accused of illegal entry. Afghan news reports also said they were spying. They have not been tried. A Western diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there has been no suggestion that an appeal for clemency would hasten the Germans' release. But he noted that West German diplomats have been allowed to visit <LOCATION> Splieth </LOCATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Hackstedt </PERSON> twice since their capture _ on Sept. 25 and on Sunday. The speed with which the visits were arranged was several months faster than those accorded foreign prisoners in the past and appear to be part of the Afghan government's move to present a more humanitarian face to the world. Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> this year has been allowed to visit Afghan political prisoners for the first time in the war. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> _ along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, most other Western nations and some non-Western ones _ withdrew their ambassadors in protest of the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Their embassies in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> are headed by charge d'affaires. Their contacts with the Afghan government are kept at a minimum. They consist primarily of meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials over visa and other consular matters and with security forces over safety measures for embassy grounds and staffers. The two West German prisoners and one of the Turks are in good health, according to the diplomat sources. The other Turk, <PERSON> Demir </PERSON>, appeared to be emotionally disturbed, one source said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The Turks were last visited by a representative of their government Oct. 6. The diplomat familiar with their situation described them as `` adventurers'' and said the espionage charges were unfounded. He said <PERSON> Uzel </PERSON> was accused of spying for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Demir </PERSON> was accused of being a West German agent. He said <PERSON> Uzel </PERSON> previously went to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to fight <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic regime. <PERSON> Uzel </PERSON> was captured by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards but escaped and soon joined the Afghan guerrillas. <PERSON> Uzel </PERSON> was captured in <LOCATION> Jawzjan </LOCATION> province which borders the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Demir </PERSON> was captured in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Splieth </PERSON>, who is in his early 30s, and <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackstedt </PERSON>, who is in her late 20s, were working with a West German private relief organization called <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anamur </ORGANIZATION>, according to the Western diplomatic source. They were captured near <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> while returning to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> after working at a dispensary in <LOCATION> Bamyan </LOCATION> province west of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Alcohol, Warm Weather and Party Atmosphere Blamed For Rioting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Warm weather, the party atmosphere surrounding homecoming weekend and increased alcohol consumption have been blamed for two nights of rioting at St. Cloud State University. `` The catalyst for this whole thing was a lot of young people with a lot of booze in them,'' Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moline </PERSON> said Sunday. `` They're not experienced enough with alcohol and they just go kind of crazy.'' Things were quiet Sunday night, authorities said. But the previous night, police clad in riot gear clashed with students and others who burned furniture and a trash bin that had been dragged into the street. Sixty people were arrested, including 34 students, police said. On Friday night, two people were arrested. At least six people, including a police officer, were treated at a hospital for minor injuries suffered Saturday night and early Sunday, said hospital nursing supervisor <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Students set off firecrackers and some played the Beatles' song `` Revolution'' on a stereo as police swept through the crowd, estimated at about 700 people, Saturday night. Other people tore down street signs and jumped on cars, or threw beer bottles and pieces of lumber. In all, as many as 1,500 people converged on a four-block area both Friday and Saturday nights, <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the 16,500-student campus, and several students said numerous out-of-towners came to St. Cloud to look for parties after Friday night's disturbance. `` Once it hit the news media, it was like an open invitation,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` Some people will go any distance for a party.'' While authorities blamed the violence on the rioters, some students said police aggravated the situation by using excessive force. `` Both sides took it too far,'' said student <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanek </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION> praised officers for their handling of the disturbance. `` In situations like this, people have a tendency to say things that look to the public like they -LRB- police -RRB- are insensitive,'' he said. <PERSON> Moline </PERSON> said that in his 31 years on the city police force, the weekend's violence could be topped only by demonstrations against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. The two people arrested Friday night probably will be charged with felony assault for throwing beer bottles, <ORGANIZATION> Moline </ORGANIZATION> said. Those arrested Saturday are likely to be charged with misdemeanors, he said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> met with school officials Sunday to discuss the riots, and university spokesman <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said a task force would be appointed to investigate. University fraternities and sororities sponsored a cleanup rally Sunday afternoon. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said the university has no jurisdiction over private rooming houses near campus that were the source of some of the trouble.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief said today the party must adopt far-reaching economic, constitutional and political reforms to alleviate poverty and calm ethnic and social unrest. `` We need a fundamental renewal of socialism which will throw out everything that is bad and outdated and replace it with new ways,'' <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said in an opening speech to a meeting of the party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been billed as a historic session to approve the most sweeping personnel changes in the four decades since the party came to power. `` The renewal of socialism means taking off its old, tight-fitting suit and letting people breathe in new surroundings,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> told the 162 members of the committee. `` All of us in this country are faced with a choice _ either we all resolve the crisis together, or we all head to destruction,'' he said in the 70-page speech reported by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> and excerpted on state-run radio and television. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> called for expanded private ownership, increased foreign investment and the shutdown of unprofitable state enterprises. He warned of possible layoffs but promised basic welfare for the unemployed. He said unspecified leading jobs should be opened up to non-party members but made clear the ruling <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION> has no intention of abandoning one-party rule. Alluding to widespread calls for personnel changes, he added, `` All the incompetent and compromised people must go and the society must be ensured of a perspective.'' Personnel reform was high on the agenda at the meeting. The expected changes come as <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> experiences its worst economic and social crisis in 43 years of communist rule. Amid growing ethnic and social unrest, living standards have fallen by one-half since 1980, and austerity measures adopted in May have slashed salaries as prices rise. Inflation is at 217 percent and the foreign debt stands at $ 21 billion. Striking workers have taken to the streets in increasing numbers, prompting alarmed officials to seek permission from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to relax the austerity program. Fourteen of the 23 members of the Communist party's ruling Politburo could be up for replacement at the meeting, including four senior leaders whose recent resignations will have to be formally accepted at the meeting. The four are former heads of the party, <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Renovica </PERSON>, a leading Communist from liberal northern <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, Franc Setinc, and a senior ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> from the troubled province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kolj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siroka </LOCATION>. Despite wide-spread calls from the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> public for the session to be televised and broadcasted live, most of the session will be closed, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio said. The dramatic changes are a response to calls from the largest republic, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, and from workers, angered by falling living standards. Ethnic Serbs want changes allowing their republic, one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six, to have more control over the provinces of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>. Workers want political and economic changes because they contend the top party leaders are inefficent and corrupt. The criticism has touched even <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, who clashed last week with <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, ambitious leader of the troubled republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The clash prompted a wave of requests from <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party organizations for <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s push for greater Serbian control of its two provinces, <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and increased central control in general in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has stirred up the current political crisis. Mass rallies have taken place all over eastern and southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in recent weeks to press this campaign. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said up to one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> could be replaced at the meeting, which is expected to last at least two days. If several Politburo members and one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> do go, it would be the most sweeping change of top personnel since the communists came to power after World War II. Supporters of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> have said that if radical changes are not agreed on at this meeting, they will demand an extraordinary party congress to try and get the changes they want. The next such forum is not due until 1990. Non-Serb leaders fear <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> is trying to use his mass popularity in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic to expand the power of the country's biggest ethnic group at the expense of others. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, in fomenting the rallies, has broken the order laid down by the country's founding father <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who gave broad autonomy to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two provinces and annually rotated national offices among them to prevent one region from dominating the others.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it planted a car bomb that killed a man early today as he was driving near <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement to the news media that <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON>, 39, died because he worked for a company that did building maintenance for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s security forces. <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON>, sales manager for <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, had driven about 200 yards from his home in <LOCATION> Dundonald </LOCATION>, just east of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, when a two-pound bomb attached to his car blew up, police said. <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON>'s wife, who was in the car at the time of the explosion, was treated in a hospital for minor injuries and released, according to a police spokesman. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the company supplied security window shutters and fireproof materials to police stations and British army bases throughout <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and to court buildings in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The firm also did maintenance work at the Belfast-area offices of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said. King is the British <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister responsible for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON> was `` an associate'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed Protestant group. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with the active cooperation of management, which included <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeown </PERSON>, have been using <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s premises ... for the storage of weapons and munitions,'' the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> alleged <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had continued to do work for the security forces despite repeated warnings to stop. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to stop construction work for the security forces began in August 1985 when a supplier of portable structures to replace bombed buildings was shot and killed in his <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> home. Since then, several other contractors have been killed. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province and unite it with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official met for the first time today with two Americans who were detained after entering <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to publicize a $ 2.4 million reward for missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> said. `` They looked all right and they did not allege any mistreatment,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` But we still have no idea of the charges against them or how the case will be disposed of.'' <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, took a rented fishing boat across the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> boundary between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and were arrested Oct. 3 at a village in the southern province of <LOCATION> Champasak </LOCATION>. They were moved last Wednesday to the Laotian capital of <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. The two were planning to pass out dollar bills and other currency offering the reward to anyone who frees a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisoner from communist-ruled <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and turns him over to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. These countries deny holding any Americans from the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy consular officer was granted access to the two Americans today after repeated requests, said the embassy official, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> were being held at the passport office building, where other foreigners have been held in recent years, generally for illegal entry. The two are members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, a private lobbying group. The $ 2.4 million reward for MIAs was offered by 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen and private citizens. On Oct. 7, four other members of the committee sailed into the same area of the Mekong and dropped stamped currency notes into the water before the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy told them to return to the Thai shore. That group was led by committee chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beret </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Kinston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. He said last week the committee would send another group of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War veterans to the Laotian side of the river if Ms. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> were not freed soon. `` We will give Lao government officials some more Americans to put in their jails until <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> are released so they can return to their families,'' <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Kinston </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> government was irritated at the group's activities on the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION>, and the official media there called it `` silly and insulting.'' `` They find it offensive to them and their sovereignty and their previous statements that they are not holding any live Americans,'' he said. However, he said <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has not tried to link the episode to overall relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still seeks to account for 2,393 Americans listed as missing in action in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> war, but no solid evidence has emerged that any are alive.

 Men with the AIDS virus have AIDS-free sperm, raising the possibility that infected males may be able to father children through artificial insemination without passing the disease to the fetus, researchers say.

Researchers are baffled by this finding because theoretically, if AIDS is present in the blood, it should be present in semen, since that fluid contains the white cells that the virus attacks. Poiesz reported the virus is present in about 20 percent of the semen samples of infected men, while the virus is present in virtually 100 percent of their blood samples. In contrast, several years ago <PERSON> Poiesz </PERSON> detected AIDS in 70 percent of semen samples from infected men. Dr. <PERSON> Suraiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasheed </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> also reported that researchers in her laboratory were no longer able to detect the AIDS virus in most semen samples from men whose blood samples show an infection rate of virtually 100 percent.

<TEXT>
 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s winds strengthened to 60 mph today as it skimmed over the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> peninsula on a westward path back out over the warm waters of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, forecasters say. `` This storm has defied what it's supposed to do,'' said <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Any storm that passes that close to land should be weakening, not strengthening.'' At 9 a.m. EDT today, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s center was located near latitude 12.0 north and longitude 72.1 west, putting it over the <LOCATION> Guajira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The storm was moving west near 12 mph on a path that would take it over the southwestern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> later today. Although little additional strengthening was expected today, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said the storm could become more powerful during the next day or two as it moved over warm water. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, whose winds diminished Sunday to 45 mph, roared back to 60 mph today with gale-force gusts extending 50 miles. Four to 8 inches of rain was recorded along the storm's path. Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for the <LOCATION> Guajira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Paraguana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monjes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Small craft in the area were asked to remain in port. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> became the 10th named system of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season when top winds passed 39 mph. It would be upgraded to a hurricane if its winds hit 74 mph. There have been four hurricanes during the six-month season that ends Nov. 30. The worst was Hurricane Gilbert, which killed more than 300 people and caused billions of dollars damage as it tore through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Yucatan peninsula.

 Siamese twins Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> were recovering well today, 13 days after they were separated in an operation at a Vietnamese hospital, a <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemoto </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Yoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Araki </PERSON>, a Japanese doctor observing the Vietnamese boys at Tu Du hospital in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, as saying the twins were doing `` very well.'' Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> were separated Oct. 4 by a 72-member Vietnamese medical team and have recovered without complications, <PERSON> Nemoto </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Araki </PERSON> as saying. The 7-year-old Vietnamese boys are believed to be the oldest Siamese twins ever separated.

The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> donated most of the medical equipment and medicine for the operation. Vietnamese officials have attributed the reported increase in births of Siamese twins in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of defoliants during the Vietnam War, including in the central highlands where Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> were born in February 1981. The defoliants included Agent Orange, which contains a compound, dioxin, known to produce birth defects in animals.

 The head of a leading opposition party will apologize for calling Latin American workers `` dregs,'' a party official said today. <PERSON> Saburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsukamoto </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, visited the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today to apologize, according to party spokesman <PERSON> Eisei </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tsukamoto </PERSON>'s decision to apologize was made after an executive party meeting this morning, according to party spokesman <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>. At a political seminar last Wednesday, <PERSON> Tsukamoto </PERSON> said that `` only the dregs remain'' in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because `` the good workers are enticed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said this was a cause of social unrest in the region. His remark was carried in most major Japanese newspapers the next day. Diplomats representing Latin American nations in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lodged a complaint Saturday with the party, calling for an apology from <PERSON> Tsukamoto </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- We -RRB- have read with great surprise and indignation in the main Japanese newspapers, your remarks ... describing the Latin American workers as ` dregs,''' the compaint said. `` Your ... remarks are inconsistant with the wishes of the peoples and governments of both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries,'' it added. The protest was signed by Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huezo </PERSON>, dean of the diplomatic missions of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. In July, <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, policy chief of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks frequently use credit cards but care little about paying their bills. Two years ago, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> angered American minorities by saying the intelligence level in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was higher than that in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of a considerable number of `` blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans over there.'' <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> is a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Naksone </PERSON> apologized for their remarks.

 An all-white <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fraternity that held a `` ghetto party'' has apologized for decorating its house with racist graffiti that offended black guests and led to a protest march. University President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottoms </PERSON> said the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house will face disciplinary proceedings that could lead to punishment. Five other fraternities and sororities that co-sponsored the party also face action. `` Certainly, the administration does n't support or condone any behavior that's offensive to our minority students, and we'll do everything to get to the bottom of it,'' Bottoms said. The graffiti included disparaging remarks about blacks, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In addition, some partygoers wore black face and dressed as pimps and prostitutes. `` We now understand that the events in question were done in poor taste,'' said fraternity president <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` The decorations in question contained expressions that do not reflect the opinions of any member of this living unit.'' `` We are very, very sorry,'' he said. `` We feel great remorse because of this.'' The fraternity has no black members, but <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said today that it has no policy excluding blacks. Several black students who attended the party Friday found the graffiti offensive, said officials at the private school that has fewer than 5,000 students. During halftime of <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION>'s homecoming football game Saturday, members of the Association of Afro-American Students held a silent march carrying signs protesting the party in front of students and alumi. Following the game, more than 200 people, including Bottoms, marched around the campus to the six fraternities and sororities involved, peacefully protesting and singing `` We Shall Overcome.''

 Five nuns who have spent nearly two weeks barricaded inside the infirmary of their monastery to protest modernization have called off talks with a priest sent by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to end the impasse. The nuns rejected the Rev. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Culligan </PERSON>, a friar from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, on Sunday because of his friendship with the monastery's prioress, against whom they are rebelling, said Sister <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON>, one of the protesting nuns They also challenge his legitimacy because he failed to show a Vatican seal on his credentials, the nuns said. Talks Saturday produced no agreement. `` He said he came here to assess whether this is an authentic Carmelite monastery,'' Sister <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> said. `` We kept telling him we have a case in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.'' The Carmelite nuns today entered their 14th day in self-segregation. Their actions have brought international attention to the Roman Catholic Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. On Oct. 4, the five sisters of the Order of Discalced Carmelites isolated themselves in the monastery's infirmary. They say they acted out of fear that the Diocese of <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> would evict them. The five oppose liberalization efforts that include the introduction of sweets, radio and television that they say detract from the life of prayer and austerity they vowed to lead. They have said they will not give up their vigil until their case is considered by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, which under canon law is the official arbitrator in disputes within a religious order. Bishop <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON>, head of the diocese, has said the nuns could be relieved of their vows for their defiance.

<HEAD>Court to hear Appeal in California Case on Tax-Fraud
Investigations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations. The justices said they will use a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION> to settle a dispute over the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to obtain and use confidential documents, particularly communications between lawyers and clients. The government, which has had numerous legal battles with the Scientologists, began an investigation in 1984 of the tax returns of the church's founder, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, who died on Jan. 24, 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it suspected that millions of dollars in church funds were transferred to <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> in the late 1970s and early 1980s in a scheme to protect the church's tax-exempt status and avoid paying taxes on the money. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> issued a summons in October 1984 for 13 confidential documents held by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state court in connection with a private lawsuit involving the church. A federal judge ruled that five of the documents should be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> but only on condition the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> not disclose the contents to any other governmental agency except in connection with a criminal tax prosecution. The judge blocked the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from obtaining the other eight documents, particularly taped conversations of confidential lawyer-client communications. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the judge's ruling in 1986. The appeals court said barring the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from turning over documents to other agencies is a `` wise exercise of control'' by the courts to protect the rights of citizens. The appeals court also said the government is not entitled to see attorney-client communications unless it can produce independent evidence that the lawyer is taking part in a fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, appealing on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, proposed that a federal judge examine the confidential documents to determine whether there is evidence of fraud. The department said the appeals court ruling will `` significantly impair <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> investigations'' because `` the actual contents of an attorney-client communication will often be the best evidence'' of whether a lawyer has participated in fraud. The department also said the 9th Circuit court ruling is in conflict with decisions by other federal appeals courts. The 9th Circuit has jurisdiction in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Block Vaccine Lawsuit in Virginia Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to block a $ 10 million lawsuit against the manufacturer of a government-approved whooping cough vaccine that allegedly caused brain damage in an infant who was inoculated. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed products. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON> was five months old in August 1983 when she was inoculated with a vaccine called Tri-Immunol manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Her mother filed a lawsuit in 1986, seeking $ 10 million in damages on grounds the vaccine caused brain damage in <LOCATION> Tracy </LOCATION>. Tri-Immunol is a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough _ or pertussis _ and is administered to millions of children without serious side effects. But it has caused serious injury in a small number of children. The vaccine is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other government health agencies. Whooping cough claimed thousands of lives before the vaccine was developed. The most serious <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> epidemic was in 1934 when there were 265,000 reported cases and 7,500 deaths. The Abbot suit said <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> failed to develop a safer whooping cough vaccine, even though other forms of the vaccine have been used outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The suit said <PERSON> Tri-Immunol </PERSON> is `` unreasonably dangerous.'' Only one other company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is licensed to produce a whooping cough vaccine. A federal judge threw out the Abbot suit. But the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated it last April. The appeals court rejected arguments that the federal government's interest in promoting use of the vaccine is frustrated by permitting suits alleging violation of state regulations. Federal law does not pre-empt such suits, the appeals court said. In a somewhat related issue, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last June that the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent. That case reinstated a suit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio after receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has not announced a position on the Abbot suit. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has pointed out that alternative vaccines to the type <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> produces have not been proven safe and effective. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed a law which took full effect Oct. 1 creating a fund to help compensate children injured by vaccines. The new law places a tax on some vaccines to provide funds for injuries that occur from vaccinations after 1986. The case is <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON>, 88-330.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Ohio Retirement Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Associated Press Writer = <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider allowing states to give larger retirement benefits to public employees forced to quit work before age 60 The court said it will review a ruling that struck down an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> pension law provision on grounds it violated a federal law against discrimination based on age. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> provision was challenged by <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, a former speech pathologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retardation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. When her work degenerated because of medical problems, Ms. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> was given a choice by the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medical leave or retirement with a standard pension. She was barred from receiving more generous disability retirement benefits because she was 61. A provision of the state pension plan allowed disability benefits only for those who worked for the state for at least five years and were under 60 when forced to quit. Ms. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>' pension would have been $ 158.50 a month under the standard plan, compared to $ 355 a month in disability retirement benefits. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last June upheld a federal judge's ruling in Ms. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>' favor that threw out the state's age-based pension provision The appeals court said the provision violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The appeals court said the federal law permits age-based benefits only when they `` can be justified by a substantial business purpose.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials failed to prove that giving larger benefits to younger workers is justified by cost considerations, the appeals court said. In fact, the appeals court said, such an arrangement might prove more costly to the state since a worker who becomes disabled at a younger age would draw more in benefits over the course of the worker's lifetime than someone disabled at 60 or older. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials argued that the state's age-based provision is permissible because it was adopted prior to enactment of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The state said federal appeals courts other than the 6th Circuit have agreed with its position. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, 88-389.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet with 52 people aboard crashed, broke into pieces and burned early today while trying to land in heavy fog at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main airport. Officials reported 30 people were killed. All of the surviving 22 people on Flight 775 from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> airport to <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, apparently were injured, said <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Iovinella </PERSON>, director of the airport police The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 tore through the side of a wooden house, clipped a garage, demolished an unoccupied brick house and then barreled through the parking lot of a rental car agency. At that point, an engine and part of a wing fell off and the impact started a fire that destroyed about 75 cars. The rest of the plane slid across a road, through a fence and knocked down trees before it broke into pieces and burst into flames about a half-mile south of the runway at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da Vinci airport, 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. One man in the wooden house, <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Satta </PERSON>, 30, suffered minor injuries when the roof collapsed. `` I was awake and heard a ringing sound. Two seconds later it sounded like the gas cylinders in the house had blown up. A few seconds later all the cars were in flames,'' said the injured man's father, <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> Passenger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harigye </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Ugandan </LOCATION> ambassador to the Vatican who was hospitalized in good condition with burns, told the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> that the plane aborted one landing attempt because of the fog and tried again about 15 minutes later. `` It was at this point that one heard a very violent collision and immediately afterwards the flames burst out,'' he said. `` My seat was upside down, but I released my seat belt, opened the emergency exit and got out with the woman sitting near me. We began to run and we heard a second explosion on the airplane.'' The commander of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Province's fire department, <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiucini </PERSON>, speculated the pilot and the control tower might have had a `` misunderstanding'' about the landing. Police said one of the dead was identified as a Ugandan. Twelve Ugandans and three Britons were among the injured, but the nationalities of the others aboard were not immediately available. Workers had recovered the remains of at least 28 victims at the crash scene, and two others died at hospitals, officials said. Other bodies were thought to be hidden in the wreckage. While firefighters raked through the debris at dawn, the charred hulk of the airliner lay smoking. Two bodies covered with sheets lay near the wrecked aircraft. Seat cushions, boxes, a makeup case and a twisted doll were scattered in the mud nearby. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubasi </PERSON>, an aviation authority official, said searchers had found the cockpit voice recorder. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said police recovered a flight data recorder. In <LOCATION> Kampala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Osende </PERSON> <PERSON> Odoi </PERSON>, general manager of the airline, said the aircraft had been modified to reduce noise and was returned to service earlier this year. Airport director <PERSON> Raffaele </PERSON> <PERSON> Casagrande </PERSON> said in a statement that 45 passengers and seven crew members were aboard the jetliner when it crashed at 12:31 a.m. He said 24 injured people were taken to four hospitals. Officials said two died later. <PERSON> Iovinella </PERSON> said the cause of the crash was not been determined. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the tower gave permission for the plane to land and reported a visibility of 4,920 feet. It said the tower called the plane again when it did n't respond. Moments later, it said, workers reported a fire at the end of the runway. The last airline disaster in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was the crash of the domestic airline <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION> turbo-prop near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Como </LOCATION> that killed all 37 aboard Oct. 15, 1987. The plane crashed moments after takeoff from <LOCATION> Linate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> on a flight to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Reputed Philadelphia-area crime boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today to overturn his extortion-conspiracy conviction. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, described as the head of organized crime in eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, is serving a 14-year prison term for scheming to extort $ 1 million from a developer of the <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s Landing redevelopment project on the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> waterfront. The developer, <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> of the extortion plan that called for it to pay $ 1 million in exchange for backing from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> city Councilman <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Beloff </PERSON> for the project. <PERSON> Beloff </PERSON> and his administrative aide, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rego </PERSON>, were tried separately and convicted in the kickback scheme. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> said he did not receive a fair trial in part because the jurors' names were withheld when they were selected. They were identified only by number. Also, the trial judge in explaining the reason for the anonymity told the jurors he wanted to assure them that they or their families had no reason to fear. `` There will be a lot of testimony concerning organized crime,'' the judge said. `` I have never heard of a case where any defendant ever tried to cause harm to a juror or a member of the juror's family But we all watch television. We all read newspapers. We see the Godfather movies. I wanted to make sure that no member of the jury would worry about it.'' Also, <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> said the jury was influenced improperly by testimony about extraneous crimes presented with `` frightening imagery and detail.'' For example, the prosecutor summed up the case by saying <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> `` is a shrewd, clever and dangerous man. He rules his criminal army with a deadly iron fist. He keeps his soldiers in mortal fear.'' The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the conviction last July. The appeals court said anonymity for the jurors and the explanation the trial judge gave for the procedure may have helped dispel the jurors' fears and served `` the ideal of dispassionate judgment.'' The appeals court also upheld the use of testimony by mob hit men who testified for the government that they carried out murders at <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s behest. The prosecution used the testimony to try and prove that the witnesses cooperated with the government for fear they would meet the same fate, the appeals court said. The case is <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-498.

 Five reputed organized crime figures from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> who challenged <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wiretaps that led to their gambling-related convictions lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that evidence from the electronic surveillance could be used against them. The appeals were by <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacalone </PERSON>; his son, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>; <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacolone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hady </PERSON>. All but <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacalone </PERSON> were convicted of taking part in a racketeering scheme to collect illegal gambling debts. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacalone </PERSON> was convicted of conducting illegal gambling. Under a plea bargain agreement, each was sentenced to one to five years in prison. They pleaded guilty while reserving the right to appeal the convictions and pretrial rulings. The defendants challenged the use of wiretaps at <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents said confidential informants told them local restaurant owners were being threatened and intimidated into purchasing food from Farm Fresh. The wiretaps, approved by a federal judge on July 28, 1982, were intended to gather evidence of extortion. The wiretaps remained in place for nearly five months. And while the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> failed to get evidence of extortion, it did get enough to win an indictment in 1986 against the five on the gambling-related charges. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last August rejected arguments that the wiretaps were unlawful and that evidence yielded by them should be suppressed. The five defendants said a federal judge should have questioned the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informants in private to determine their veracity before allowing evidence from the wiretaps to be used. But the 6th Circuit court said it was enough that the judge questioned the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents behind closed doors. `` Suppression is required only when -LRB- the law enforcement official seeking a wiretap -RRB- deliberately lied or testified in reckless disregard of the truth,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court also rejected arguments that the wiretaps were approved without probable cause to believe the defendants would use their telephones for extortion. The judge who approved the wiretaps `` could reasonably conclude that there was a fair probability that defendants would refer to their illegal activities during the course of their telephone conversations with their customers and others,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court also dismissed the defendants' claim that the surveillance was too extensive. The case is <PERSON> Giacalone </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-509.

 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> today proposed elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to select Palestinians who would negotiate peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The call was part of a policy statement issued by <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> in the campaign for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s general elections Nov. 1 Polls indicate Labor and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc are running neck-and-neck. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, troops shot and wounded eight Palestinians, including two 13-year-old boys, during clashes in the towns of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, hospital officials said. On Sunday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, vowed that `` nothing will remain'' of Palestinians who carry out threats to use firearms against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told reporters today that any Palestinian living in the occupied territories should be permitted to run in elections, even if they supported the banned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The Labor leaders said a cessation of anti-Israeli violence for a period of three to six months was a precondition for such elections. `` If the violence is restrained, we will hold free elections in <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> so that a Palestinian ... delegation can be elected -LRB- to -RRB- represent the Palestinian side in negotiations,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said, using the biblical names for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. He said that if efforts to arrange formal peace negotiations fail, a Labor-led government would transfer control of municipal and local affairs to elected leaders from the territories, with the Israeli army only in charge of security. The army now runs daily municipal affairs in the occupied lands. Elections were last held in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in 1976, when mayors were chosen in major towns and cities. The officials all supported the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and refused to act as representatives in peace negotiations. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> made his remark against Palestinian use of firearms Sunday to more than 2,000 supporters in the southern town of <LOCATION> Sderot </LOCATION>, according to his spokesman, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was responding to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports that <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, an aide to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, had said Palestinians would exchange their stone-throwing methods against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops for firearms if <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is re-elected prime minister. `` If the Arabs of <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> start fighting the army with firearms, nothing will remain of those terrorists, and there is no doubt that an end will come to the intefadeh -LRB- Arabic for uprising -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, according to <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. So far, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have primarily confronted <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and civilians with stones, bottles and firebombs. However, the recent use of firearms by Palestinians included two grenades hurled at army vehicles in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> last week, injuring two soldiers. The 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in which 299 Arabs have been killed and about 7,000 wounded, has emerged as the primary issue in the national elections. Six Israelis have been killed in the unrest. Army figures show 896 Israelis have been injured in the rebellion, including 575 troops and 321 civilians, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes withdrawal from the lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 Middle East War.

 A researcher who shared the Nobel Prize for medicine today said the best reward is still knowing his work has saved lives, while his longtime colleague says she was more disbelieving than anything after journalists gave her the news. `` The phone keeps ringing and I ca n't seem to finish getting dressed or anything else,'' said <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> since 1944, from her home in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` I think I'm going to have trouble getting to work on time.'' <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>, 70; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, 83, another longtime Wellcome researcher; and a British scientist shared the award and will split a prize worth $ 390,000. `` It's wonderful for my descendents,'' joked <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` I've had many awards, but my real awards have come from patients whose lives have been saved by the drugs I've invented.'' The work of <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> led to a series of drugs for the treatment of cancer and a variety of other diseases. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> is a major pharmaceutical company. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> said she first got the news at 6:30 a.m. from a reporter and had not yet heard from Nobel officials. `` Surprised is not exactly the word,'' she said, when asked her reaction to the prize. `` Disbelieving is the right word. As I say, I have n't heard from the Nobel people, and until they confirm it, I wo n't believe it. I did not even know I had been nominated for it.'' She said a reporter had read her parts of the citation, `` but it was fairly vague. I do n't even know exactly what the award is for at this point.'' She said she had collaborated with <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> for more than 40 years. `` That's why it's so surprising when something like this happens after so many years,'' she said. `` I have n't been able to use the phone to call him,'' she said of <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>. `` But other people who have called have told me they talked to him, so I know he knows about it. I think I'll have to go use a phone somewhere else, but first I've got to run a comb through my hair.'' <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, received a doctorate in biochemistry from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1933 and holds more than 80 American patents. He joined <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> in 1942 as a biochemist and retired in 1975 as vice president for research. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, received a bachelor's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1937, and a master's degree in chemistry from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1941. She joined <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> in 1944 as a biochemist. In 1967, she was appointed head of the department of experimental therapy, a position she held until her retirment in 1983. <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> followed a line of nucleic acid research that led to the discovery of new drugs for malaria, leukemia, gout, bacterial infections and the first immune suppressant to make kidney transplants possible, the company said. The drugs developed by the two scientists include Imuran, for kidney transplants; <PERSON> Purinethol </PERSON>, a cancer drug used to treat leukemia patients; Zyloprim, for gout; and Zovirax, the first drug developed for the treatment of herpes virus infections, said <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. The researchers hold the title of scientist emeritus at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>, signifying that they are retired. Despite their retirement, both have continued to work on projects, said another company spokesman, <PERSON> Thack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Both of them still come to work every day,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` They both have their own research projects, but they were so involved in so many things that were going on in research that they're still consulted.'' This is the third Nobel Prize for <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. In 1936, Sir <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, an early director of research and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, was awarded a Nobel in medicine for his studies of chemical transmission of nerve impulses. In 1982, Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vane </PERSON>, group research and development director, won a Nobel in medicine for his role in discovering the way in which aspirin works to reduce pain and inflammation.

 Fifty-nine children found crowded in a four-bedroom farmhouse should remain in state custody while authorities investigate the beating death of an 8-year-old girl, officials said. Four people have been charged with murder in the death of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, the daughter of the founder of a Los Angeles-based Christian center established to train and discipline inner-city youngsters. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, chief deputy state medical examiner, said Sunday the girl had been `` whipped severely'' and suffered fatal `` blunt-force injuries.'' There also was evidence of an old injury on her body, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. Police said several adults from the rural home near <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, which once served as the headquarters for the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, brought the dead child to a fire station 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> early Friday. Investigators later found the other children in the four-bedroom farmhouse, some with scars that might indicate physical abuse, said sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Detloff </PERSON>. The children, ranging in age from 1 -LCB- months to 16 years, were hungry but otherwise healthy, according to officials who admitted them to state juvenile facilities over the weekend. All reportedly were from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Based on everything we know right now, we'll recommend continued -LRB- state -RRB- custody,'' said <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a branch manager of the state Children's Services Division. The division planned to ask authorities to approve the custody extension at a juvenile court hearing in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> this afternoon. `` We've had little contact with the parents,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We've not heard from very many of them.'' The father of the dead girl, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, arrived from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and was interviewed Sunday by sheriff's investigators. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, 35, has said that his group has been trying to promote spiritual and moral values through athletics, but has complained that the media have portrayed him as a `` crackpot.'' Last year, Ecclesia officials claimed to have established a camp at the Sandy site to train children for the Olympics. But it was unclear if the children found last week were engaged in a similar training program. Charged with murder in the girl's death were <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, 30; <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Zipporah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 37; <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, 28; and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 35, all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They remain in custody in the county jail. Two other adults connected with <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s group were charged with hindering prosecution and were jailed pending $ 100,000 bail each.

 An Afghan guerrilla leader said today the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants direct talks with the Moslem forces fighting the Moscow-backed Afghan government. Official Afghan radio said troops killed two Americans who were helping guerrillas. `` The green lights have been shown'' for direct negotiations, said <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, current chairman of a seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance headquartered in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate. `` The negotiations and how they will happen will be seen in the future,'' <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> told reporters after returning from a five-week trip to northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. No comment to the report was immediately available from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In negotiating a U.N.-mediated agreement in April to withdraw Soviet troops, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> did not meet with the U.S.-backed guerrillas and spoke instead with Pakistani officials. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> ruled out any coalition government that included communists but he said there was room in a guerrilla-controlled government for `` some elements from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' `` Non-communist elements working in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> could be included,'' he said. Official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Sunday did not identify the Americans reportedly killed in the attack a day earlier, but a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on government business. The broadcast contended the Americans were helping the guerrillas. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had heard nothing of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens being killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet officials often have alleged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel trains guerrilla forces near the Afghan border in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. American reporters often travel to the Afghan capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and to other areas. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said the Americans and two Pakistani officers died Saturday when government forces attacked Moslem guerrilla positions near <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION> city, about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said she knew nothing of the report and said she could not even say whether any Americans were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In recent years, three Americans have been killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, a reporter for the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> newspaper, and independent filmmakers <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Landiloff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The Pakistani government had no immediate comment on the report. In other developments, the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sent its 100th note of protest alleging Pakistani violations of the U.N.-mediated agreement aimed at ending the fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The accord, signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, requires the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to withdraw its armed forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by February. The Soviets say half of their more than 100,000 troops are back home. The Soviets and the Afghans accuse <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the agreement by allowing its territory to be used as a base by U.S.-backed rebel groups and by permitting arms and munitions to cross <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to the insurgents. The Soviets intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to preside over the replacement of one Marxist ruler by another and stayed on to fight the insurgency.

 A man who lost a cabin to this summer's fires in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area has filed a claim with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and expects others to join in his legal action. Dr. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Watters </PERSON>, whose $ 60,000, nearly finished cabin in <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> north of <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was one of four destroyed when a backfire started by firefighters roared out of control, predicts a rash of lawsuits against the government unless it properly reimburses property owners for their losses. `` There will be the darnedest class-action lawsuit you ever saw in your life,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Fires charred more than 1.6 million acres in the worst fire season in the park's history. `` I think we were betrayed,'' said <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficken </PERSON> of <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, whose mobile home southeast of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, was destroyed by fires despite firefighters' assurances it would be protected. `` I just do n't think we got any help. So we just burned.'' Federal policies call for claims to be paid only if government negligence can be proven, but <PERSON> Watters </PERSON> said he does not believe that will be a problem. `` The -LRB- National -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> realizes they blew it,'' he said. `` They tell you now that they were suppressing those fires, but they were n't. They were as proud as peacocks of those natural fires that they were letting burn _ and then they let things get away from them.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policies, naturally caused fires in parks or wilderness areas were allowed to burn unless they threatened structures or safety. Both agencies switched to the offensive against fires in July because of extremely dry conditions. A number of business owners around the park have claimed they lost money because the fires discouraged travelers from visiting the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area. Four <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> counties have been declared disaster areas, clearing the way for low-interest loans, but the loans are not expected to help those who lost summer or permanent homes or outfitters who lost business because of the fires.

 American researchers <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> won the 1988 Nobel Prize in medicine today for discoveries leading to drugs that treat AIDS and herpes. Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> shared the award for research that led to a beta blocker drug for heart disease and a drug for peptic ulcers. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> quipped today that the prize came as such a shock that `` I wished I had my beta blockers handy.'' The Americans' research also led to the development of drugs for the treatment of leukemia, malaria, and to fight the rejection of transplanted organs, said the Nobel Assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>, 70, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> native, and <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, 83, born in <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, are affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Black, 64, born in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, works at <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,'' <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his office. `` I've had a lot of honors, but the most important honors for me have been meeting patients whose lives have been saved or whose children's lives have been saved by drugs I've invented. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> said from her home in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>: `` Surprised is not exactly the word. `` Disbelieving is the right word. ... I did n't even know I had been nominated.'' The work of <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> broke new ground in finding the difference in the processing of genetic material between normal cells and cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and viruses, the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said. Knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack disease-causing organisms by interfering with their replication, the announcement said. The institute said that among the drugs developed from their ideas is azidothymidine, or AZT, which has had the best documented results in the treatment of AIDS, the institute said. AZT is the only federally approved drug for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are still harvesting the fruits of what they determined almost 40 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjoqvist </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Their discoveries in the late 1940s led to a variety of drugs, like 6-mercaptopurine in 1951 for leukemia. They also developed azathioprine, which was for many years the only drug available to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. Another breakthrough in applying their research came in 1977, when the first effective drug was developed for treating herpes virus infections. The drug, acyclovir, does not cure genital herpes, but it makes outbreaks of sores less severe and makes them heal faster. In 1964, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> developed the first clinically useful beta blocker drug, propranolol, for use in the treatment of heart disease. Propranolol acts on beta receptors on nerves leading to the heart and blocks the stimulating effect of adrenaline. Receptors are specific places to which drugs and natural substances attach themselves to produce their effects. Physiologist <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Pernow </PERSON>, another member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Black </PERSON> made `` the greatest breakthrough when it comes to pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of digitalis 200 years ago.'' In 1972, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> discovered a group of histamine receptors, a finding that led to the development of the drug cimetidine for peptic ulcer.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Conviction in Dallas Flag-Burning</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider reinstating a criminal conviction against a man who burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag at a demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The court said it will review a ruling that the flag burning was a form of symbolic expression protected by the Constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last April threw out the conviction of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who had been sentenced to one year in jail and fined $ 2,000. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was arrested on Aug. 22, 1984, while participating in a demonstration against the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the Republicans. The protest had culminated with a rally in front of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> that included political chants and the flag burning. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was convicted by a jury of violating a state law banning the desecration of a venerated object. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Given the context of an organized demonstration, speeches, slogans and the distribution of literature, anyone who observed -LRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s -RRB- act would have understood the message that -LRB- he -RRB- intended to convey. The act for which -LRB- he -RRB- was convicted was clearly ` speech' contemplated by the First Amendment.'' The state court said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law against flag desecration is too broad because it seeks to curb expression likely to cause `` serious offense.'' In other action, the court: _ Set the stage for an important libel law ruling by agreeing to review a $ 200,000 award won against a <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, newspaper. The court will use an appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> to decide, sometime by July, how closely appeals courts must scrutinize jury findings of `` actual malice'' when a public figure sues for libel. _ Refused to block a $ 10 million lawsuit against the manufacturer of a government-approved whooping cough vaccine that allegedly caused brain damage in an infant who was inoculated. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed products. _ Left intact the espionage and theft convictions of a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence analyst who gave secret satellite photographs to a British magazine. The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>, who is serving a two-year prison sentence for leaking the photos of a Soviet ship to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense Weekly. _ Agreed to hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations. The justices said they will use a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION> to settle a dispute over the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to obtain and use confidential documents, particularly communications between lawyers and clients. _ Agreed to consider allowing states to give larger retirement benefits to public employees forced to quit work before age 60. The court said it will review a ruling that struck down an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> pension law provision on grounds it violated a federal law against discrimination based on age. _ Ordered a lower court to consider reinstating a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law that limits access by children to sexually explicit material in bookstores. The justices set aside a ruling that declared the law unconstitutional and ordered further study in light of a new analysis that said the statute has limited applications. In the flag case, police officers who arrested <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said they were seriously offended by the flag burning. There also was testimony that the charred fragments of the flag were collected by an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> who was so upset that he later buried the flag's remains in his backyard. But the state court said seriously offending someone is not the same as inciting to riot _ an activity that permits restraints on free speech. `` One can not equate ` serious offense' with incitement to breach the peace,'' the state court said. The state court also rejected arguments by law enforcement officials that the anti-desecration statute legitimately preserves the flag `` as a symbol of unity.'' `` Recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our First Amendment freedoms, a government can not mandate by fiat a feeling of unity in its citizens,'' the state court said. `` Therefore that very same government can not carve out a symbol of unity and prescribe a set of approved messages to be associated with that symbol when it can not mandate the status or feeling the symbol purports to present.'' The state court did not declare the law itself unconstitutional. It declined to decide whether there might be situations where flag burning does not represent symbolic speech and may be prosecuted. The state court cited several <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings to support its decision, including a 1974 ruling that threw out the conviction of a man who displayed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag with a peace symbol attached to it. The case is <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 88-155.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> graduate students who were rappelling down steep cliffs were killed after plunging to a trail below, authorities said today. `` They were rappelling down and apparently were both tied to the same anchor point, and when one fell it broke the point where it was tied off,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> of the state Fish and Game Department. About 50 rescuers worked more than five hours on 4,060-foot Cannon Mountain to retrieve the bodies of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunshine </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Fragge </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitchell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said. The two were climbing a section of Cannon Cliffs called `` Beware of the Dog.'' Mock said authorities had not determined how far the two fell, but believe the accident happened at 3:38 p.m. Sunday because a watch strapped to one of the climber's packs was smashed and had stopped at that time. Two other climbers who were hiking the trail below Cannon Cliffs found the bodies at 5:20 p.m., <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> physicians that toured Kurdish refugee camps has concluded <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons against the ethnic Kurdish minority in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a spokesman said. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook-Deegan </PERSON>, representing the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> most likely used `` a high dose of one of the kind of irritant agents or a nerve agent.'' He did not elaborate. The physician also accused <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> of covering up <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons for security and economic reasons. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> wants to keep good relations with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and win a role in rebuilding the nation after its 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A Turkish government report maintains no traces of poison gas were found on the refugees during medical screenings. But Turkish officials have said their report does not eliminate the possibility that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used such weapons. <PERSON> Cook-Deegan </PERSON> said the group's findings were based on interviews with more than 100 Kurds who fled into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and also on medical questionnaires given to 25 refugees. The doctor, a senior associate working for the office of Technology Assessment at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, spoke to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Thursday on condition the information be used Sunday after the three-member delegation left <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The team's other two members were Dr. <PERSON> Howaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Asfandiar </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON>, a Detroit-based physician. About 60,000 Kurds fled to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in August, claiming <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped chemical bombs on their settlements. They now live in five tent cities in southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` It is difficult to explain the sudden exodus of people that were used to being shot at. If it would have been a conventional weapon attack, there would have been evidence of physical injuries such as bullet wounds,'' <PERSON> Cook-Deegan </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons particularly on a population within its border,'' he said. He said the Kurdish refugees most commonly complained about bloody diarrhea, vomiting, skin irritation, and eye and respiratory problems. `` Those are very typical symptoms of chemical agents called irritants,'' <PERSON> Cook-Deegan </PERSON> said. He added that the refugees also described small animals such as birds and bees dying right after the attack. <PERSON> Cook-Deegan </PERSON> criticized the Turkish government for witholding information about the issue. He said the Turkish government also did not release the results of autopsy reports on Kurdish refugees who died immediately after arriving in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The Turkish government announced a month ago that it would turn down any efforts to send <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to determine if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used poison gas against Kurds. The 14-page questionnaire used by the three-member team contained dozens of queries requiring detailed answers about the respondent's health before and after the attack. <PERSON> Cook-Deegan </PERSON> said they will analyze the questionnaires and prepare a report in a month. Investigators for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also reported after touring the refugee camps in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in attacks to depopulate <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Kurdish regions. `` We find no question that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s policy in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> has the characteristics of genocide,'' the two staff members, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, concluded in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, last month. The Kurds, 20 million people living in a region that lies in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, have been fighting battles for independence for the past century. The latest rebellion took advantage of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Soon after an Aug. 20 cease-fire went into effect in that war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> turned upon the Kurds, unleashing war-hardened elite troops upon the Kurdish guerrillas.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today resumed his attack on presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on defense, accusing the Democrat of spreading `` misinformation'' about the state of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces. The Republican vice president, in remarks prepared for delivery at a <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> defense contractor plant, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` trying desperately to jump into the mainstream'' by acknowledging a need to modernize land-based defenses. `` But there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it, especially when it comes to modernizing our land-based missiles. He still opposes the MX and he thinks the Midgetman costs too much. So he says he's going to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to find another way. `` Wake up, governor, we've done all that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that in 1983 the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was formed to study national defense issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to stop spreading what he called `` misinformation'' about the state of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. `` It's not 1980 anymore. Our divisional war fighting capabilities have improved by an average of 60 percent since 1980,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Notwithstanding my opponents' claims, only a few of the A-6's are grounded because of wing cracks _ not one third. We've got the money to fix them as fast as the manufacturer can do it. `` Governor, it's time to stop running down our defenses,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In his first news conference in more than two weeks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday that questions such as a query about his agenda for the first 60 days in office `` are putting me beyond where I want to be.'' `` So if I do n't answer some of them from here on in it is because I'm focusing on November 8 and I do n't want to be dragged beyond that because things seem to be going well now,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee has a solid lead in many national polls and <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> surveys. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoyed a low-key Sunday, joining family members at a football game between the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broncos </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION>. The vice president, who viewed the game from a private box, was introduced at halftime to a mixture of cheers and boos. At the news conference, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee declined to say what budget cuts he would make to balance the budget, and was unspecific when asked how he would deal with funding for the Nicaraguan rebels and whether the homeless problem warrants special Cabinet-level supervision. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he already has a team studying the transition to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency and that he is ready to name his Cabinet quickly. Former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> heads the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team. `` He has drawn up wiring diagrams, what we should do if we win,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You have to hit the ground running.'' The vice president, however, scoffed at suggestions that he already had decided on most of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members he would choose. `` I ca n't let myself think about that. ... I'm not going to do something that dumb and shift gears,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Referring to his escalating poll ratings since Thursday's debate, he said, `` I can tell you I've been encouraged _ certainly not one scintilla of overconfidence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not disclose where he would make deficit-reducing budget cuts, because that is something he will work out with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when the times comes, according to his staff. `` You have to sit down and know the facts at the time,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the news conference. On how he would handle the Contra situation in light of the rebels' diminished military capacity, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't give you what I'll do after I become president, but I'm a strong believer that we made a big mistake, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did, in not supporting the resistance ... I would simply take a hard look when I got there, see what the facts were at the time, and try to help the forces that want democracy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would put his vice president in charge of a national anti-drug program, but when asked what other duties he would give him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said only that it would be `` a wide area of assignments based on the model of the last two administrations.'' As to whether the homeless problem might merit special oversight by the vice president, he replied: `` There's a lot of problems of sufficient severity to require the attention of the president and vice president. Whether that means setting up some special operation, I could n't possibly say.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintained that he can balance the budget by 1992 under his `` flexible freeze'' plan to limit federal spenfing to the rate of inflation, with cuts off-setting each new spending item. He has listed some areas where he would spend more money, including education, child care and cleaning up the environment, but has refused to list cuts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded that, for his idea to work, interest rates would have to decline by several percentage points from current levels.

 Underdog <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to reverse his slide in pre-election polls, declared in the industrial Middle West today that Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` sat on his hands while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland has been fighting for its life.'' In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the Democratic presidential nominee said that `` here in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> you've lost thousands of manufacturing jobs And just last week we learned that we had more imports coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in August than in any month in history.'' Aides said that in the final three weeks of the campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would sharpen the differences between him and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, particularly on economic issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> shortly after publication of a new poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> which showed him trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in this critical state by 11 points. Political aide <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> dismissed the poll, saying the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> electorate is `` volatile.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, he said, `` is winnable.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending a full day in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to be followed by a similar all-day foray into <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` The sense is that you want to create a bigger impact on a state by putting a lot of attention on it in one day,'' he said. Asked in which major states <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is now trailing, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would only reply, `` They're all competitive.'' In his Euclid speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talks about `` a kinder, gentler nation,'' his record contradicts that message. `` His record tells the people of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, ` We do n't care enough about you to protect you from the nuclear weapons facilities that are poisoning your water and threatening the safety of your workers','' he said. `` And I ` m here to tell you that in a Dukakis-Bentsen administration, we'll have an Energy Department that makes sure that its citizens and communities are never again threatened by nuclear waste and deadly radioactive clouds,'' he said. On foreign trade, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has not given the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people a clue as to what he would do. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trade policy is like a rerun of ` Let's Make a Deal,' letting the voters guess what's behind door No. 1, door No. 2 and door No. 3.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he would `` open the doors of foreign markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products, because I want an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more concerned with selling American goods abroad than selling American debt abroad.'' At a hometown rally in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cast the Nov. 8 election as a contest between his middle-class work ethic and penthouse Republicans who support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I enter the last three weeks of this campaign as an underdog, fighting for the values I believe in,'' he said. While the emphasis in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was on values, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said the Democratic nominee would concentrate on spelling out `` two different visions of our economic future'' during appearances in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> over the next three days. `` The close of the campaign is going to be headed by a focus on the economic issues,'' said <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told supporters in historic <LOCATION> Faneuil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where leaders of the American Revolution often met, that Republicans were `` already celebrating; they're popping champagne corks in their penthouses. But I've got news for those Republicans; we're going to be the ones celebrating on election night.'' Emphasizing the differences between himself and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee said, `` I believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that's in command of its destiny and takes charge of its future.'' He said the vice president `` sat on the sidelines for eight years while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> got beaten in world markets, while they mortgaged our children's future to a mountain of debt, and a piece of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was being sold off every day at bargain basement prices.'' Said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` I believe <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leaders must strive to do the right thing; but we must admit it _ and correct it _ when we do the wrong thing. ... I've taken responsibility for my mistakes. But Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes responsibility for nothing.'' `` I believe in the value of work,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` saw nothing, said nothing and did nothing while his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> used every trick in the book to keep the minimum wage a poverty wage.'' `` Ask Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he went on `` if he can look a woman in the eye who scrubs floors for a living to support her family on $ 3.35 an hour.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> denied the accuracy of a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> story on Sunday that said he would concentrate his efforts on 18 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> with 272 electoral votes _ two more than needed for election. The list contained most of the major states _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ that both sides describe as key battlegrounds. Also on the list were <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Given lower priority, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, were <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, home state of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` It is not -LRB- accurate -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. `` We are not writing off whole regions of the country,'' she said. She noted that while the story put <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> among the states being given less priority, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be in both this week.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> remained in serious but stable condition Monday, nearly one month after suffering internal bleeding, palace officials said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, fell ill Sept. 19, and has been bedridden since. `` The emperor as usual is fully conscious,'' said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Doctors gave <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> nearly a half-pint of blood Monday. Since Sept. 19, he has received more than 18 pints to replace the blood lost and to combat anemia. The Imperial Household Agency has released little information about the nature of his illness beyond releasing his temperature and pulse and respiration rates three times daily and the amount of blood <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has received. News reports have said the emperor has pancreatic cancer. The agency has neither confirmed nor denied the reports and has urged the media to refrain from such speculation. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has no political power but serves as a symbol of national unity.

<HEAD>TV Ads Help Bush Pull Even With Dukakis in Big-Prize California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In just 60 seconds, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transformed his prospects in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from a potential landslide loss to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> into a dead-heat battle for the state's 47 electoral votes, the biggest prize in the presidential election. That magic minute for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was comprised of two 30-second television commercials _ one attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, the other focusing on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program permitting furloughs for prison inmates. Before those commercials began airing on TV stations throughout the state, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a strong, often double-digit, lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters in public opinion polls. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had been scoring heavily with strong attacks on the Reagan-Bush administration's environmental record and with speeches linking the vice president to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described as a `` drug-running Panamanian dictator.'' But since the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign began its <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and crime commercials, the gap between the two candidates has narrowed in the nation's largest state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has counterattacked with a commercial contending that `` it was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration that cut funds to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' The spot accused the administration of cutting money allocated to clean up the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast as well. `` So when you hear <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talk about the environment, remember what he did to the environment,'' the commercial concludes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the support of major environmental organizations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The lure of this state's 47 electoral votes _ nearly one-sixth of the 270 needed for election on Nov. 8 _ has brought the state a steady stream of campaign visits and an avalanche of money. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is an integral part of nearly every winning scenario,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign communications director <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has spent 10 days in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since Labor Day and will be in the state at least six more days before Election Day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been in the state nine days over the same period and also will return before the election. He can expect determined help here from his chief campaign surrogate, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was twice elected governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopcraft </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state campaign, said at least $ 10 million would be spent in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> boosting the Democratic nominee's election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides were unable to supply a figure, but there seemed little doubt that the vice president's backers also were spending millions in the state. `` We've been sitting in a dead heat for a couple of weeks now,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, who is directing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effort in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We are ahead in this state,'' claims <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>'s counterpart with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign But if the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is leading, it is by the narrowest of margins. The most recent public poll said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leading by 4 points. No state polling data has been available since the final presidential debate was held in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Oct. 13, but national surveys said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was given the edge in that confrontation. Both campaigns are working hard to build grass-roots organizations capable of getting out the vote for their candidates. <PERSON> Hopcraft </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was making 30,000 telephone contacts nightly to recruit volunteers, and would have a leader in each of the state's 23,617 precincts by Election Day. <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> phone banks have contacted 600,000 voters. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign also has the benefit of Republican Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s statewide organization. <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was `` too big to be organized simply as another state.'' As a result, he said, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has carved it into four distinct regions. They are the Republican heartland in such southern counties as <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>, the heavily Democratic <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, less heavily <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and rural areas that are proving to be an important battleground in this race. During <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s most recent appearances on a bus tour of the central valley, he kept up his attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` When you hear those liberals talk, the 11 most feared words in the English language are ` I'm from the federal government and I'm here to help you','' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people do n't believe that.'' Before a Hispanic audience in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> labeled the attacks `` cynical'' and accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the vice president of ignoring the concerns of the poor and middle class. `` We ca n't take four years of that, we ca n't take four days of that,'' he said. When speaking to Hispanics, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> often lapses into Spanish, which invariably gets a strong positive response. Hispanics are a fast-growing part of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> electorate but their election turnout is lower than among other groups of voters.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has borrowed and returned expensive gowns and other clothing used for official functions, but nothing in the government ethics laws required disclosure of these transactions, her press secretary said today. Responding to a story in the Oct. 24 issue of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> confirmed that the first lady had been lent gowns since 1982. White House lawyers agreed in 1982 that any borrowed dresses should be considered as loans and reported. `` I do n't think the law -LRB- Ethics in Government Act of 1978 -RRB- required for those gowns to be reported,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. `` They have all been returned.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked earlier to comment on the Time report, said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` very upset about all these attacks'' on the first lady. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokeswoman denied that the first lady had kept any of the numerous dresses and matched outfits loaned to her by designers. Time said neither the disclosure forms nor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tax returns from 1982 through 1987 listed loans or gifts of dresses to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> did not deny that there had been no such disclosures. She said there had been earlier disclosures, but that it was subsequently decided that they were not required in instances where dresses were returned. `` To a typical woman, there are some gowns that are so spectacular that you would only wear it once,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` Forget to report them? I do n't know. ... I do know that there was no law broken.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said that there were some disclosures in 1981 because it was decided to list the dresses borrowed, even though officials did not believe it was required, just to allay any doubt about the transactions. The spokeswoman had said last week that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told her she has bought all the clothes she has worn since early 1982, according to the magazine. Today, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> amended that to say that `` she considers her personal wardrobe to have been bought. There have been things that have been borrowed _ and returned _ since 1982.'' When asked whether an internal inquiry had been commenced in the White House counsel's office to determine the validity of the assertions about Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s use of clothes, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` No. At this point, I do n't know that there's any need for one.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> designer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has borrowed 60 to 80 made-to-order outfits during the past eight years. She returned more than half and kept the others, he said. `` We think of it as loans. It's wonderful,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> told Time. `` She has been a sensation for my business.'' An unidentified executive at <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> jewelers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> told Time that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> continued to borrow expensive accessories, including a pair of diamond earrings worth $ 800,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said today that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on two occasions borrowed jewelry from <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> jewelers _ for the 1981 presidential inaugural and for the wedding of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> later that year. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazakis </PERSON>, who works with designer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON> and is writing a book about the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, said he has identified more than 300 photographs since 1982 showing Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wearing outfits he estimates are worth a total of more than $ 1 million retail. In November 1981, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> disclosed she had been accepting clothing as gifts. On Jan. 14, 1982, she announced that she would consider dresses accepted in 1981 as loans, and would select the best and give them to 13 museums. According to Time, the museums report that the last such donation was in 1982. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said there have been no such museum donations since then because Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned the dresses to the designers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists can point to some successes in the soon-to-end 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, although efforts to reach compromises to strengthen the Clean Air Act proved once again to be elusive. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted legislation to improve the Endangered Species Act, switch the nation's vehicles to alternative fuels and launch campaigns against indoor pollution from radon gas and to control increasing amounts of improperly discarded medical waste. But gathering dust along with the clean air bill were proposals to give the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> more clout over hazardous waste generated by other federal agencies and to set ground rules for disposing of ash from growing numbers of municipal incinerators. Also left undone was one of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's more controversial land-use proposals to the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a plan to allow petroleum development in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. Environmentally, the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began in January 1987 with a fiscal battle against the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over the future of the Clean Water Act, the law credited with improving the quality of many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s waterways. A 1986 bill to give local governments $ 18 billion through 1994 to build waste water and sewage treatment facilities had been pocket-vetoed as too costly by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after the 99th Congress adjourned. By huge majorities in both chambers, the 100th quickly sent the same bill to the president, who was trying to cut the funding to $ 12 billion and vetoed the package a second time. Republicans deserted the White House in droves as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 401-26 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 86-14 to override the second veto. There was a major element of pork-barrel in the outcome: every state and virtually every district was in line for a share of the money. While this fight occurred on the front lines, the struggle over the clean air bill took place in the trenches, with neither the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> able to bring a proposal to the floor for debate. Led by Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> drafted an ambitious package to attack urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals. The administration opposed major portions of it, and the bill's depth and breadth brought it a wide variety of industry foes. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> spent much of 1988 trying to unite diverse economic and regional interests but abandoned efforts in early October, saying there was a lack of will to compromise among the environmental and industry lobbies. On the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side, a clean air bill never came up for a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> despite efforts by middle-ground members to bring together environmentalist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., and chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who opposed <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s plan to clean up auto While deadlocked on low-level air pollution, committees on both sides of the Capitol were raising their sights with a series of hearings on global warming, the greenhouse effect that scientists say threatens the planet with climate changes and rising sea levels. Legislation was introduced in both chambers to begin clamping down on the greenhouse gases that are trapping the sun's heat in the atmosphere. More hearings are planned for the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which will be looking to the new president to exercise leadership against a global environmental threat. On another global issue, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year ratified the international agreement to reduce emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals said to be destroying the Earth's vital ozone layer. The 1987 agreement was largely the result of a worldwide diplomatic effort by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which for nearly eight years has fought <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on many proposals to improve the domestic environment. One exception was the joint work by the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the recently passed bill to combat radon, the naturally occurring gas that seeps into buildings and is described as second only to cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer. The bill sets a long-term goal of having indoor air as free of radon concentrations as the air outdoors. It would authorize $ 30 million to help states set up radon control programs, require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to survey schools for radon and mandate standards for radon abatement contractors. One of the potentially far-reaching acts of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was a plan to switch cars, trucks and buses away from gasoline to alternative fuels made from coal, natural gas and grain. The legislation attempts to wean the nation away from petroleum imports by giving automakers incentives to produce the vehicles that are necessary to spur production of alternatives to gasoline. Responding to increasing reports of medical waste washing up on shorelines, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently passed legislation to require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to set up controls to track this sometimes dangerous trash. The initial program would be geared to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the eight states bordering the Great Lakes. It could, however, become national in scope because any other state could ask to be included.

The largest fire, a 2,000-plus acre blaze in the <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, challenged firefighters trying to protect homes about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We'll either catch it, or we'll chase it,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> firefighter <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>. `` It's burning some areas that have n't burned in a real long, long time.'' The fire, raging through Placerita Canyon north of <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION>, sent a plume of smoke 7,000 feet high, and two firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the blaze, authorities said. The smoke was visible 50 miles away at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and at Dodger Stadium during Sunday's Game 2 of the World Series. The fire moved closer through the night to homes on the northeast rim of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, but no evacuations were ordered, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderhaar </PERSON> said. `` They can look out their back yards and see the fire,'' she said. Flames pushing to within a mile of the Wildlife Way Station worried workers at the non-profit refuge for more than 1,000 wild animals, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Colette </PERSON>, adding it was an unusally quiet night at the compound. `` The lions stopped roaring and the coyotes stopped howling. They can smell the fire and they are extremely quiet because of it,'' she said. A dozen water tankers surrounded the facility at dawn. `` We will have to make our stand here. It would not be feasible to evacuate the animals,'' she said. More than 500 firefighters worked through the night to turn the blaze as it burned dry brush in highly inaccessible mountainous terrain, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. Swirling winds sent flames in three different directions, compounding the effort, he said. Three <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> men accused of starting the blaze with an illegal campfire were jailed on $ 2,500 bail, said Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenal </PERSON>. He said the blaze appeared accidental. In Sequoia National Park, a 1,000-acre fire burned near trees more than 2,000 years old in the three-square-mile <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was met by nearly 500 firefighters, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>. A successful backfire set to broaden a buffer around the grove of what are considered the largest living things on Earth gave officials hope the area around the majestic trees would not be burned, she said. But the giant sequoias themselves are considered relatively immune from fires because their bark does n't burn easily, and because their branches are so far above the ground, experts said. About 100 campers fled the flames that broke out Sunday morning in the Potwisha Camp Ground about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION> and 175 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The fire was blamed on a careless camper, Ms. <PERSON> Case </PERSON> said. An 800-acre brush fire in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hemet </LOCATION> burned out of control about 85 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but firefighters were gaining the upper hand and predicted control later today, said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Two smaller fires erupted in the mountainous eastern portion of the Angeles National Forest. One, a 55-acre blaze started by children playing with matches and a cigarette lighter, destroyed a house before it was extinguished. Firefighters were keeping the other one, a 150-acre fire, from crossing a ridge this morning but had not contained it, authorities said.

 Former White House aide <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said today she is quitting as president of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English after being told that at least one major contributor to the group has advocated forced sterilization. `` I am resigning,'' she said. `` To me, it is just not consistent with the views I hold.'' Veteran CBS newsman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> resigned from the group's advisory board last week after being told of a 1986 memo by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> that raised the spectre of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> becoming overwhelmed by foreign-speaking have-nots Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in 1986 and a former aide in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week that she might follow suit if <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> did not step down following a weekend board meeting. On Monday, she said she had since learned that at least one major contributor had helped reprint `` an awful, awful book'' called `` Coup of the Saints'' which she described as `` a paranoid fantasy'' about `` undesirables of the Third World'' taking over developed nations. At least one major contributor has given money to `` groups that may be involved in eugenics research,'' she added. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> did not identify the contributor or contributors about whom she was speaking but said she asked <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> whether he knew of the contributors' other activities. He told her he was n't aware of them A proposition bankrolled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English that is on the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ballot next month would change the Arizona Constitution to designate English as the state's official language and limit government use of foreign languages in courts, meetings and schools. Similar measures are on the ballot in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said she had planned to leave the group anyway following the weekend board meeting but decided after hearing about the contributors that `` I do n't feel that I wish to wait until other details are worked out.'' At their meeting in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English board of directors decided to review <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON>'s activities in immigration-reform and population-control groups and his 1986 memo before taking any action. <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> did not immediately return a call seeking comment, and an operator at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said no one else was available. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said she had sought assurances about the type of backers the organization had before she joined it and had given up administrative control of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English several weeks ago because the organization's financial records were n't being kept in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I feel that there were some misrepresentations made,'' she said in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, a spokesman for opponents of the ballot proposition said word of her resignation would help his efforts. `` This resignation confirms what we have been saying,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` It is hard for anyone to support <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanton </PERSON> and Proposition 106 when the facts are known. One shadowy figure from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is pushing his grisly vision upon the people of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said she still supported the idea behind <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> English and believed the proposition could stand on its own merit no matter who supported or opposed it. Supporters of Proposition 106 say it would unify the state and help minorities join the mainstream more quickly. Critics claim it would disrupt the operation of civil courts, English-proficiency classes, tourism and commerce with other countries.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts Told To Yell And Tell When Threatened With Abuse</HEAD>

 Boy Scout leaders seeking to ward off child molesters are telling their troops in a `` yell and tell'' campaign that it's okay for a Scout to be rude and even to holler `` no'' if someone tries to do something wrong. The assertiveness training is part of a nationwide Youth Protection Training program unveiled this year by the Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We know that perverted individuals seek out youth organizations such as Scouts, choirs and teams. What we have done is sharpen our scrutiny and make the Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> very uncomfortable for pedophiles,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area scouting director. In his eight years as executive director of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> scouting headquarters, <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON> said he had heard only four official complaints of molestation. In 24 years of scouting work before that he recalls only one complaint, he said. But <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Accus </PERSON>, spokesman for the Boy Scouts national headquarters in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said at least 100 official accusations of sexual assault have been registered in the past decade nationwide. The program has 1.5 million leaders operating each year. In the past year, Explorer Scout posts in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area have been involved in two sexual assault cases. A former <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy was sentenced in May to nine years in prison for sexual assault on a minor. Three Scouts testified he used his position to gain their trust and manipulated their loyalty to seduce them. Last month a former Explorer Scout accused a <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> patrolman of sexually abusing her in 1984. The case has not yet come to trial. <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON> has scheduled a Youth Protection workshop Oct. 22 for leaders of nearly 150 metro-area Explorer Scout Posts. Effective last month, anyone wanting to become a Boy Scout leader must submit an application that lists any drug, child abuse or other felony charges. Scouting adminstrators also are teaching leaders to avoid being accused, <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON> said. `` At one time, Scout leaders counseling a kid could shut the door and sit down to talk with him. But now we tell them not to get alone with Scouts,'' <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON> said. In addition to the ban on one-on-one contact, new rules require that at least two supervising adults accompany outings such as campouts. `` It is a great dilemma,'' <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON> said. `` There are plenty of kids out there who really need an arm around their shoulder and some affection. I do n't really think that hugging is completely out. `` But if I want to put an arm around a Scout who has done well, I do it in public and standing in the middle of the room.''

 Final agreement was reached today on a military pact between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> that ensures continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of crucial <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> air and naval bases while boosting American aid to the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. `` It is a very important achievement,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said the agreement would be signed later today by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>. Negotiators for the two governments worked on final details until a few hours before the ceremony. `` We have reached basic agreement,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> announced, saying no details would be left over for negotiators to grapple with later. The agreement covers use of the two largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military outposts abroad __ <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Base _ and four smaller installations. On Sunday, <PERSON> Manglus </PERSON> said the pact included $ 481 million in annual payments, other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concessions, an agreement on nuclear weapons and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for a bond program aimed at reducing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' $ 28 billion debt. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> are considered vital to regional and Western security interests across a wide part of the world stretching from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The agreement falls far short of the $ 1.2 billion that <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> sources say <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> originally wanted. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, however, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials were never far apart on actual cash compensation in talks that began in April in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. He said their disagreements were over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to approve benefits and concessions that would not require congressional approval. For five years, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has been receiving $ 180 million in annual military and economic aid tied to the bases. Additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid has boosted the total to more than $ 450 million a year since Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took power in February 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> announced Sunday that the signing ceremonies would take place in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She gave no details and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said during the weekend only that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials hoped for a conclusion of the agreement today. A U.S.-Philippines working group continued to iron out technical details on Sunday. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, however, disclosed the broad scope of the agreement in a telephone interview. The pact is expected to lead to talks next year on the long-term future of the bases, which many Filipinos want removed after the lease lapses in 1991. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not said whether she supports <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of the bases after 1991. Any new treaty would have to be approved by a two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a possible referendum. Failure to conclude the bases review, originally scheduled for July, has delayed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration endorsement of a $ 5 billion multilateral aid program proposed by two Republican and two Democratic members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. White House sources have said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backs the plan, but it could not be set up until the amount of the base compensation was set. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have not said what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the so-called `` mini-Marshall Plan'' would be, but <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government sources have said $ 300 million annually has been discussed, with a like amount expected from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the rest from other countries. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said that while the multinational aid plan is separate from the bases, a new debt-relief portion of the bases pact will allow more help from other countries to come in the form of direct aid rather than debt relief. The bases-linked debt-relief plan is a complex arrangement, calling for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to put up <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds that would back a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> bond issue that initially would be exchanged for outstanding debts at 50 cents on the dollar, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said. He said the value of the plan to the country would depend on the bond market. Philippine officials previously said they would ask that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put up $ 100 million in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds to back a Philippine bond issue. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said one <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> proposal was to have this come from the first installment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share in the multinational aid plan. But he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials agreed to an even more beneficial arrangement, with the money coming from stepped up payments of delayed fiscal 1988 and 1989 aid that previously could not be used to pay off the debt. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after he and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> failed to reach agreement in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge to give the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> title to all improvements on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities at the bases is `` an important concession.'' The bases were deeded to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> under a previous agreement but are used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops under the pact. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> declined to give details of a nuclear weapons agreement he said was in the documents being signed. The Philippine Senate has voted to ban nuclear weapons, but officials in <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government have interpreted the law to allow the president the last word on whether exceptions might be made in the national interest. With <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s agreement, this could allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue its policy of neiher confirming nor denying the location of nuclear armaments. During the politically charged negotiations in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said the bases were not necessary for <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> security, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they could be moved if the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> demanded too much compensation.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis on the Attack With 3 Weeks to Go</HEAD>

newspaper recommends Dukakis rather than Bush</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

 Attacking vigorously with just over three weeks to the election, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today his Democratic rival should `` stop running down our defenses,'' while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't care enough about people to protect them from nuclear-poisoned water. Far from conceding the presidential race is over, despite polls showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a lead, the two contenders were out campaigning early and hard as the week began. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, seeking votes in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, one of the states it is now clear he must win to have a chance on Election Day, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president has `` sat on his hands while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland has been fighting for its life.'' `` Here in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> you've lost thousands of manufacturing jobs. And just last week we learned that we had more imports coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in August than in any month in history,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He also said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talks about `` a kinder, gentler nation,'' his record contradicts that message. `` His record tells the people of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, ` We do n't care enough about you to protect you from the nuclear weapons facilities that are poisoning your water and threatening the safety of your workers,''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, resumed his attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on defense. In remarks prepared for delivery at a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> defense plant, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` trying desperately to jump into the mainstream'' by talking of a need to modernize land-based defenses. `` But there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it, especially when it comes to modernizing our land-based missiles,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` It's time the liberal governor stopped spreading what I'll call charitably ` misinformation' about the state of our forces. It's not 1980 any more. Our divisional war fighting capabilities have improved by an average of 60 percent sine 1980.'' A day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cautioned against overconfidence and promised to stick to his campaign course, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, facing an uphill struggle in the presidential race, nevertheless predicted victory on Election Day. Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sentiments today, saying at a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, `` We're going to run like we're 10 points behind. The vice president, buoyed by polls showing him widening his lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said Sunday that his presidential transition team, headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, is already at work and that he will be ready to name his Cabinet quickly. `` He has drawn up wiring diagrams, what we should do if we win,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You have to hit the ground running.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, in his first news conference in more than two weeks, dismissed suggestions that he has already decided on the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members he would choose. `` I ca n't let myself think about that ... I'm not going to do something that dumb and shift gears,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> where he said his campaign will `` keep on with our original game plan, keep working hard, keep traveling to key states ... keep moving forward.'' `` All I know is to just drive down to the wire,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, encouraged by a warm reception from hometown supporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s historic <PERSON> Faneuil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, described himself as the campaign's underdog, but warned Republicans about toasting success three weeks before the election. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> is `` already celebrating; they're popping champagne corks in their penthouses,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` But I've got news for those Republicans; we're going to be the ones celebrating on Election Night.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to follow his campaign strategy with the focus on Election Day _ not Inauguration Day, and deflected questions about his presidential agenda. `` I can tell you I've been encouraged _ certainly not one scintilla of overconfidence,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Questioned about possible budget cuts to reduce the deficit and additional aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded: `` I'm having trouble with these questions because they are putting me beyond where I want to be So if I do n't answer some of them from here on in it is because I'm focusing on November 8 and I do n't want to be dragged beyond that because things seem to be going well now. On the budget question, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he will work it out with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when the time comes. `` You have to sit down and know the facts at the time,'' he said. And on aid to the Contra rebels, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't give you what I'll do after I become president, but I'm a strong believer that we made a big mistake, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did, in not supporting the resistance.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up the editorial support of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times, which recommends candidates rather than endorses them, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was backed by three <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> newspapers _ The <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Elyria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>. In his Sunday appearance, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cast the election as a battle between the work ethic of the middle class and the rich Republicans who support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I believe in the value of work,'' the Democratic nominee said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- saw nothing, said nothing and did nothing while his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> used every trick in the book to keep the minimum wage at poverty level.'' `` Ask Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added, `` if he can look a woman in the eye who scrubs floors for a living to support her family on $ 3.35 an hour.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described himself as an `` underdog, fighting for the values I believe in.''

 A Japanese man who works for a trading company forced four other Monopoly players into bankruptcy Monday to win the eighth world championship in a record, 2 \ - `` Most pleased!'' said <PERSON> Ikuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiyakuta </PERSON>, gasping for breath after his victory. `` I really wanted to win. I was determined.'' The 36-year-old from <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, defeated <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to win $ 15,140 in cash, the same amount that comes in each Monopoly set. The final game, in which five players competed, was the longest of the eight championships held so far, organizers said. The game ends when one person has forced everyone else into bankruptcy. <PERSON> Hiyakuta </PERSON> has been playing Monopoly seriously for four years and is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s national champion. The runners-up, who each won $ 1,000, were <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON>; <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Edblom </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Safinaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zulficar </PERSON>, who reigned as Queen <PERSON> Farida </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for 11 years before being divorced by her husband <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON>, was buried today after a simple funeral. <PERSON> Farida </PERSON>, 67, died on Sunday, almost two weeks after being admitted to a hospital for pneumonia. She spent four days in a coma before her death. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> assigned his first chamberlain to join about 700 mourners at the funeral. Although it was not a state affair, several senior government officials walked at the head of the procession. The funeral was a far cry from <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON>'s nighttime burial in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, without a procession and with only a few of his closest family members allowed to attend. <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON>, overthrown by the army in 1952 and sent into exile in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, died in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on March 18, 1965. At the family's request, his body was brought to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> 12 days later and was buried at <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al-Rifai </PERSON> Mosque next to his father, King <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farida </PERSON>, Arabic for unique, was the name <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> decided to give his bride after their marriage in 1938, two years after he became king He was 18 then, she 17. They had three daughters, <PERSON> Feria </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fawzia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fadia </PERSON>. What seemingly began as a happy marriage began to crack up after <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> started public affairs with other women and frequented night clubs and gambling casinos in the mid-1940s. His popularity dropped as scandal involving him became common knowledge. At the same time, <PERSON> Farida </PERSON>, widely regarded as the wronged partner, gained in public stature. Women in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> could not sue for divorce at the time, but <PERSON> Farida </PERSON> demanded a divorce, and continued in her efforts despite pressure from government officials to dissuade her, said <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper columnist <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, who was close to the royal family. In 1948, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> granted the divorce. No reason was given, and other reports said the divorce was caused because <PERSON> Farida </PERSON> did not bear him a son. The ex-queen moved with the daughters to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and later moved to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where she took up painting. <PERSON> Farida </PERSON> returned home in 1982 and settled in a small apartment in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. She held several exhibitions of her paintings, which were mainly depictions of life in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Farida </PERSON>'s last wish was to see her daughters. All three were summoned from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where they live, and were at their mother's bedside when she died. <PERSON> Farida </PERSON> never spoke ill of <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> in public, despite the anguish she reportedly endured. In a eulogy published today, <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> wrote that she once told him: `` Remember, he was the father of my daughters. Any bad word I utter about him would hurt them.''

<HEAD>Socialist Wrote Pledge of Allegiance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scholars say few people would have been more surprised by the Pledge of Allegiance's prominence in the 1988 presidential campaign than the man who wrote it. He was a socialist. The pledge first appeared in a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, The Youth's Companion, 96 years ago, on Sept. 8, 1892 Although there are competing claims to authorship, most authorities credit the Rev. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>, a Baptist minister who preached against big business and served as vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION>. His daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>, 92, of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, recalls him as tall, proud and `` kind of stuffy.'' She said he eventually left the ministry because he felt the church `` was not doing enough to help the working man.'' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, who has written two books on the history of the pledge, believes <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>'s congregation grew tired of his political homilies _ one was entitled `` Jesus the Socialist'' _ and forced him out of the pulpit. In any event, <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> joined the staff of The Youth's Companion in 1891 and apparently composed the pledge a few months later, while the magazine was in the midst of a campaign to sell <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags. The Youth's Companion had pioneered the sale of subscription `` premiums'' ranging from school uniforms to silver tea services. But it achieved its greatest commercial success, and its enduring legacy, with its drive to put a flag in every school in the land. The flags were priced at $ 3.30 to $ 13, depending on size. To help schools raise the money, the magazine provided `` flag certificates'' that pupils could sell for 10 cents apiece. Starting a year early, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>'s Companion urged school children to prepare to celebrate the 400th anniversary of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' voyage to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which was coming up in October 1892 To show it was truly companionable, the magazine even published a suggested `` Columbian Celebration'' ceremony. Most of it just happened to require a flag. Sandwiched between a presidential proclamation and an ode to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, both long forgotten, was the original 23-word pledge, memorable both for its sentiment and its economy of phrasing: `` I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it stands: one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' It was not until 1923 that the words `` my flag'' were replaced by `` the flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' out of concern that immigrant children might otherwise think they were pledging allegiance to some other flag. The phrase `` under God'' was inserted in 1954 at the behest of President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, who said that `` in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war.'' The original version of the pledge was not signed, but once it had caught on in the schools, rival claims to authorship quickly emerged. One group pushed for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Upham </PERSON>, an editor of The Youth's Companion. The other favored <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and a few other scholars argue that <PERSON> Upham </PERSON> was the author. But two formal investigations, one conducted by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag Association in 1939 and the other by the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1957, concluded that <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> was responsible. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, a researcher in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> espoused `` a relatively benign form'' of socialism. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which he belonged to, wanted to nationalize chunks of the American economy but have them controlled at the municipal level. ... He did not practice or preach violent overthrow of the government by any means,'' <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> said. Controversy over the pledge erupted in the 1940s, when <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses refused to recite it in the public schools Members of the sect said swearing allegiance to a material object violated their religious principles, which dictated allegiance only to God. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> initially rejected such arguments, ruling in a 1940 case that public schools could expel children who did not recite the pledge. The court reversed itself in 1943 and said children could not be compelled to recite the pledge. Meantime, <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses had been subjected to vicious attacks in dozens of communities. In <LOCATION> Richwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for example, members of the sheriff's department and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> forced seven members of the sect to drink large quantities of castor oil, then tied them together and paraded them through the town. `` <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> was an avid fan of saying the pledge,'' said <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, `` but I ca n't imagine how he would have felt about it if he had lived to see the mob violence of the 40s.''

<TEXT>
 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Monday discussed efforts to fight anti-Semitism. Neither side would comment publicly on a plan for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to aid Holocaust victims. Before the meeting, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said he hoped a final decision could be reached during his visit on reparations to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution. But the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, in several extensive dispatches, made no mention of discussions about compensation. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> also refused specific comment on the issue, saying only that the talk was `` pleasant, very warm and very cordial.'' `` We agreed on all the fundamentals,'' he said, adding that details of the discussions would be announced Tuesday. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> has said that an admission of shared responsibility for the Holocaust was as important as financial contributions to victims. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s efforts to educate its young people about the horrors of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The struggle against racism and anti-Semitism belongs to the anti-fascist tradition of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We will never forget that many Jews, together with communists and Social Democrats ... were active in the struggle against the Nazi dictatorship.'' ADN quoted <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> that `` I believe that today we have built a bridge.'' The news agency said <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> for recent government efforts on the part of Jews, including funding for the reconstruction of an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> synagogue. After <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> arrived Sunday, he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he believed the East German leadership was sincere in offering reparations. Such an agreement would mark a major change in the communist nation's previous policies. `` I'm optimistic,'' he said. `` What is at stake here is moral culpability.'' More than 6 million Jews were killed during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich, a fact that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> does not dispute. Since its founding in 1949, however, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has argued that it bears no reponsibility for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> atrocities because the nation was born after World War II ended. In past months, East German media have reported on government efforts to improve relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Jewish community. In June, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said it was willing to provide `` humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, but negotiations have continued on the reparations themselves. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Jewish leaders have said that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been considering paying up to $ 100 million. In 1952, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to compensate Holocaust victims and families. Since then, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has paid more than $ 48 billion to Holocaust survivors worldwide. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also was founded in 1949. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> also planned to meet with leaders of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s tiny Jewish community before departing Tuesday. There are an estimated 450-600 practicing Jews in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Argentine warships began joint maneuvers Monday for the first time in seven years.

<TEXT>
 A gunman who had apparently tried to steal $ 1 million in jewels belonging to the late <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was shot and killed by police when he fled the entertainer's museum with a 74-year-old hostage, authorities and witnesses said. The dead man was identified as <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> had a lengthy arrest record dating back to the 1960s. Hostage <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>, who had worked at the museum 10 years, was not injured. She was able to give the police the opportunity to shoot the gunman by sitting on the sidewalk as if her legs had buckled underneath her. The museum is one of the city's top tourist attractions, featuring memorabilia of the entertainer who gained fame here and retained a home not far from the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died in February 1987 of complications due to AIDS. Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said she was just closing the office Sunday when the suspect appeared, saying he wanted to deliver a plant. The man produced a gun, forced his way into the museum, and refused offers of money, she said. Another worker was able to summon police, she said. <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, sister-in-law of the entertainer and administrator of the museum, said the man carried a bag of tools, including a crowbar, and obviously intended to break into a case displaying $ 1 million in jewelry owned by <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> arrived at the museum shortly after the shooting occurred. When <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> spotted police, he forced Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> out the front door at gunpoint and made his way toward a car he had driven to the scene, officials said.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Continue to Rise, But Sales Outstrip Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories continued their steady rise in August, the government said Monday, but economists remain untroubled because the expansion is not outpacing strong sales. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said goods held on shelves and backlots rose 0.8 percent to $ 733.7 billion, following a 0.7 percent gain in July. It was the 20th consecutive monthly increase. Rising inventories can be a sign of economic sluggishness as manufacturers order production cuts and layoffs while goods in reserve are sold off. However, analysts are not particularly troubled by current inventory levels because sales also have been strong. Compared with a year ago, inventories are up 8.7 percent while sales are up 8.0 percent. The department said August sales totaled $ 487.7 billion, up a brisk 1.1 percent from July, when the gain was a slight 0.1 percent. It was the ninth increase in a row. `` If we're looking for a reason for a slowdown in 1989, it wo n't be excess inventory building ... Typically recessions develop when there are excess levels of inventory and we're not looking at those levels this year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. Inventory accumulation in August was led by a 1.4 percent rise at retailers, where sales are the slowest. Wholesale inventories were up 0.6 percent while inventories at factories, where an export boom has kept sales strongest, increased 0.5 percent. However, half of the inventory buildup among retailers is accounted for by a 2.9 percent rise at auto dealers. Car sales have been strong this year, so dealers did not offer price cuts or financing incentives to move cars from the old model year off their lots. `` Inventories are in pretty good shape, with the notable exception of apparel,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` However, the overall inventory level wo n't remain in good shape unless retail sales pick up in October and November But I think they will.'' In sales, a 2.1 percent increase at manufacturing plants more than offset a 0.1 percent decline at the retail level. Wholesalers reported a 0.7 percent increase. An advance estimate of retail sales for September, released last week, showed a 0.4 percent decline. The combination of moderately strong gain in inventories and an even more robust sales increase left the inventory-to-sales ratio at 1.50, unchanged from July and June and up slightly from 1.49 a year ago. That means it would take 1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the August sales pace, a ratio not considered unusually high.

 Two Sikhs sentenced to death for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> wo n't be executed until the president rules on a petition for mercy, news reports said Monday. The executions of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were scheduled for Oct. 19 but will be delayed until President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> rules on the mercy plea, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The news agency, quoting an unidentified governement spokesman, said a new date for the executions would be announced if the petition is rejected. The mercy plea was filed by <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 54, but both executions will be stayed, the agency said. <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 24, has refused to file a similar plea. The announcement of the postponement came hours after two courts declined to stay the hanging of the two men. The <ORGANIZATION> Delhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected a petition for the stay until police investigate a complaint filed by <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> that security guards shot at him after disarming him following Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said A magistrate's court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, another court where <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON>'s complain was being heard, also rejected a plea to delay the execution Both courts said they had no jurisdiction to stay the hanging after it was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The petition also noted authorities recently arrested a Sikh terrorist who allegedly helped plan Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s murder and an investigation was pending, the report said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot and killed in the garden of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> home on Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. The two men are not related. Sikhs by doctrine of their faith take the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> apparently was murdered in revenge for an army raid she ordered four months earlier on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the Sikhs' holiest shrine in the northern city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> More than 1,200 people died in the attack, most of them Sikhs. <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were shot by other security guards moments after the assassination, and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> later died of bullet wounds. <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s maternal uncle, <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was arrested a month later and charged with conspiracy in the assassination. <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging in January 1986 after an eight-month trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Delhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the convictions and death sentences.

 A space shuttle main rocket engine will be test-fired Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the first extended firing since the roar of Saturn rockets echoed across <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> in the 1960s. `` It's going to be something <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> has n't heard for quite awhile,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Amatore </PERSON> said. The 15-second firing is part of a series of tests on the shuttle main engines and coincides with the city's `` Space Awareness Week.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers want to determine how long the rocket motors, fueled by hydrogen and oxygen from the shuttle's huge external tank, can run if needed. The engines now operate for about eight minutes during a shuttle launch. Shuttle engine No. 0208, installed in the test stand in August, was `` warmed up'' in a 1.5-second start test last month. After this week's test, a third test firing of 45 seconds will be scheduled in November. <PERSON> Amatore </PERSON> said the primary goal of the first brief tests is to verify that <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> can handle the firings and whether a metal `` flame bucket'' on the test stand can handle the rocket exhaust. The last test firing of a big rocket motor at <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> was a Saturn test on Sept. 11, 1969, about two months after men first set foot on the moon. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s main propulsion center.

<TEXT>
 The strain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial capacity eased in September for the first time in seven months as utilities scaled back after the summer heat wave, the government said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the overall operating rate last month at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities fell to 83.6 percent of capacity, down 0.2 percentage points from August. In July, the rate also was 83.8 percent, soaring to an eight-year high from 83.0 percent in June as utilities produced more electricity to run air conditioners. Utility operating rates fell from 83.6 percent in August to 79.9 percent last month, while electric utilities fell from 88.1 percent to 83.5 percent. `` Utilities had their big surge in July and August and then they came back to normal,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The relevant thing is what went on in the manufacturing sector. ... There, I think we can say the pressure on resources has n't worsened, but it still remains relatively high and therefore any easing of inflation pressures is unlikely,'' he said. The operating rate at manufacturing plants held steady at 83.8 percent, the same as August and down slightly from 83.9 percent in July, the most recent peak. Economists have expressed concern that high factory operating rates and a tight labor market are exerting inflationary pressure on the economy. If overall operating rates get too high, overworked factories can have trouble meeting demand, leading to higher prices. Capacity use at manufacturers of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, edged up 0.1 percentage points to 82.4 percent while the rate for non-durable goods edged down by the same amount to 85.8 percent. The largest increase came at auto assembly plants, where the operating rate rose 3.6 percentage points to 74.0 percent. `` The overall level of capacity utilization does n't signal as much price pressure as it might because the hot industries are cooling and the cool industries are speeding up,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. Two areas of particular tightness _ paper and textiles _ have cooled from levels a year ago. Capacity use among paper manufacturers was 93.8 percent in August, the latest month available, down from 95.7 percent in September 1987. The rate for textiles has eased from 93.6 percent to 89.1 percent in August. The rate for the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, rebounded to 83.1 percent last month, up from 82.8 percent in August but still below the 83.2 percent July rate.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies operating abroad do not have to comply with the civil rights law forbidding discrimination on the job, a federal appeals court ruled Monday. The 2-1 ruling by the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld a lower court ruling against <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Boureslan </PERSON>, a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen who was born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and employed by <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dhahran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. He filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, contending that he was fired in June 1984 after a harassment campaign by his supervisor _ `` a campaign which took the form of racial, religious and ethnic slurs,'' the 5th Circuit said. The seven-page majority ruling by Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the court could not find any indication in the law or in its legislative history that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had meant to extend civil rights protection to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens employed abroad. Arguments that it is unfair to deny Americans employed abroad protections to which they are entitled in this country are appealing, but do not overcome other strong policy arguments, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> wrote. `` The religious and social customs practiced in many countries are wholly at odds with those of this country,'' the ruling said. `` Requiring American employers to comply with Title VII in such a country could well leave <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations the difficult choice of either refusing to employ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the country or discontinuing business.'' In a strong 17-page dissent, Judge <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dineen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said it may be necessary to enforce the law abroad to be sure that minorities and women have an equal chance at home. `` Today's decision means that one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen assigned to the Saudi office of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporation, and another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen working for the same company in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> could experience identical acts of discrimination, but only the latter will have a remedy. This situation creates a dilemma for minorities and women: foreign assignments will be less attractive, while refusal of such an assignment could limit an individual's opportunity for advancement,'' she wrote. She noted that assignement to a foreign office is frequently a required step for promotion within a multinational corporation. This means, she said, that this country may have to enforce its civil rights laws abroad to ensure equal chances at foreign assignments that would affect employment opportunities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Her dissent agreed with other arguments brought up by <PERSON> Boureslan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which entered a friend-of-the-court brief. They argued that a section exempting aliens working for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations in other countries showed that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did intend it to apply to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens under such circumstances.

Pravda said aircraft builders believe the Tu-204 will be the most economical Soviet plane in its class. Pravda also published a photograph of the airliner, showing its two wing-mounted jet engines and a fuselage that resembles other aircraft of the Tupolev bureau, including the Tu-154 passenger jet that is one of the workhorses in the Aeroflot fleet. <PERSON> Tupolev </PERSON> said innovative production processes had ensured a reduction in the new plane's weight and improved the performance of its exterior.

 Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> grabbed a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> line Monday as he campaigned in the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> pledging `` good jobs at good wages.'' In a series of stops across <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where the presidential race is considered close, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stressed economic themes, even using some phrases that sounded more like Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> than the leader of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s own ticket, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` When we talk about the future. we're talking about jobs and opportunity,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told thousands of cheering high school students in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>. `` I'm talking about good jobs and I'm talking about good jobs at good wages.'' The good jobs-good wages line has been a staple in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign speeches for months. As for the election, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the Republicans would ignore polls showing them ahead with three weeks to go. `` It is down to the wire time,'' he said. `` We all think it's going to be very competitive We're going to run like we're 10 points behind.'' In a state where the auto industry has been hard-hit by foreign competition, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` We are talking about fair, free trade'' without resorting to `` protectionist barriers.'' Later in the day, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Traverse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> elsewhere in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Senator, appealed to regional pride at various stops, where he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds inside and knots of protesters outside. `` That man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> may look down on us in middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but come Election Day they'll be looking up to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Us Midwesterners have to stick together.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appreared relaxed and upbeat as he swung across the state, surprising customers with an appearance at a fast-food restaurant and occasionally joking with reporters on his campaign plane. Questioned outside one stop, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that he was `` very close personally'' with presidential standardbearer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but that joint appearances by the two would be `` a little bit counterproductive.'' `` I would n't ask for it,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I want him to cover his part of the country and I want to cover my part of the country.'' In his remarks to the students, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` My goal is the same goal you have and that is a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` When you have a drug kingpin involved in murder, that person is going to get the death penalty,'' he said. `` It may sound harsh, but those people are peddling and are merchants of death. When they're going to murder our children and put poison in their veins, yes, capital punishment is an appropriate response.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who said last week that he had complained to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about anonymous criticism of him from campaign officials, said they had had a `` very upbeat'' talk. Asked if <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had offered him any advice for the final three weeks of the campaign, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` No, I gave him my advice.'' As he started his campaign day, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dropped in at a Burger King, surprising a handful of customers. He apologized for disturbing the relative tranquility of the place as a crowd of reporters and photographers climbed over booths. `` You were sitting here nice and quiet and we ruined it,'' he said. But he left with an exhortation: `` Tell them <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I will work hard for you.''

<HEAD>Rare Giant Fern Could Be Endangered By Development</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A giant fern so rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that biologists had refused to reveal its whereabouts for fear it would be wiped out now faces extinction anyway because of a proposed development. In the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the cuplet fern grows only in two small swampy spots a half-mile apart in the Black Hammock, a 7,680-acre wetlands area about 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. Identified in 1802, the fern used to grow on the southern edge of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> but was plowed under for farmland decades ago. The fern, <LOCATION> Dennstaedtia </LOCATION> bipinnata, also is found in the <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` It's a fern that's over your head. You can stand under it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, a research ecologist for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Natural Areas Inventory. `` When you get out in a clump of these giant ferns you feel like you're out in the tropics.'' But a tiny piece of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hammock </ORGANIZATION> attracted the interest of a retired priest, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Caulfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, and he and another priest bought 40 acres and planned to sell it off in five-acre lots. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> discovered <PERSON> Caulfield </PERSON>'s plans 13 months ago when he had a road cut through the wetlands south of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jesup </LOCATION> without a drainage permit. The road and the small development `` would bode most ill for the fern,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantz </PERSON>, who edits publications for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittier </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> biology professor who takes students on fern tours, says even cutting down trees nearby could let in light and cold wind that could change the fern's special climate. <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> has transplanted a few ferns to the university's arboretum, but they are n't as robust outside their native habitat The water district regulatory agency planned to fine Caulfield $ 1,000 and make him plant trees where the road was cut, but <PERSON> Caulfield </PERSON> has applied for an after-the-fact permit to build the quarter-mile road and develop eight lots. He already has sold two. The water management district says <PERSON> Caulfield </PERSON> is trying to figure out a way to develop his property and protect the fern. The water district also is considering several ways to protect the fern, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, the district's field office director in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. It will be difficult for <PERSON> Caulfield </PERSON> to convince the district that he can develop the property without damaging the wetlands, <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said. `` We recognize the fern as a valuable resource and we would be remiss to not even address it,'' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said. But the long-term outlook is not good. The entire Black Hammock is slowly being nibbled away by turf farms, vegetable farms, tree nurseries and rural homes, <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> said.

 Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted today on charges of perjury, accused of lying to a federal grand jury investigating money laundering. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a Republican, was indicted on 10 counts of perjury over his testimony before a grand jury last February about a sting in which a federal agent posed as a money launderer. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s office said today he had no immediate response to the announcement. But he had said Sunday, during a television interview, that he expected to be indicted and was glad because he hoped it would give him a chance to clear his name before his re-election bid goes to the voters Nov. 8. In an unusually bitter race, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 47, is seeking a third term from suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s 4th District against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponent <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 46, a former actor on television's `` Dukes of Hazzard'' who lost to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> in 1986. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> ever since the money-laundering-related charges were first aired, while <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has assailed <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' past conviction on a charge of wife-beating, a conviction <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> says stemmed from alcohol abuse that he has since overcome. In Sunday's interview, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he expected to be arraigned this afternoon and planned to waive a number of rights, including the right to charge the government with misconduct in the case, so that he can go on trial next Monday. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said he did not know whether such a quick trial would be possible. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he planned to represent himself at the trial. `` I am actually excited because it will be the first opportunity I am going to have to clear the air, clear my name and give the voters a legitimate race based on the issues,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said in the interview Sunday. Angered by continued reports linking his name with the grand jury investigation, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> took the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor on Oct. 3 to demand an immediate indictment. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said the timing of the indictment `` has nothing whatsoever to do with politics'' or <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s request to be indicted. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was first linked publicly to the money laundering investigation earlier this year when it was disclosed that his Aug. 28, 1987, meeting with an undercover federal agent posing as a money launderer for underworld figures had been videotaped. `` Money laundering'' is a term for various methods of getting around federal currency laws by transferring illicitly raised cash _ drug money, for example _ into bank accounts in such a way that its origin is hid. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was introduced to the undercover agent by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman who was active in Republican circles. LeChasney is one of the two men scheduled to go on trial next week on money-laundering charges. <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and several <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> aides testified before the grand jury last month. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> testified before the grand jury in February. In June, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspapers obtained several tape recordings from the investigation and published excerpts from a series of conversations between <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and the undercover agent. The tapes showed that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> continued to pursue negotiations for an $ 850,000 home construction loan after being told it might be financed with drug money he would be helping to launder. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was quoted on the tapes as saying that the source of the money was `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' problem,'' since LeChasney would be obtaining the money to lend to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. He added, `` I frankly do n't think it's incumbent upon me to go out and find out where <ORGANIZATION> XYZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gets their money, or, for that matter, where <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gets their money. If they set back the odometer, that's their problem.'' He ended the negotiations after being told he would have to accept the money in person in cash and sign a receipt. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> later apologized for his role in the negotiations, calling it a mistake in judgment, but he denied any wrongdoing. He also asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to determine if he had violated any law or House rule. The panel agreed to investigate, but has not issued a ruling. The indictment said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied when he told the grand jury last February that he did not have any concrete indication that <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and the undercover agent were discussing illegal activities. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> testified that he was suspicious of the agent, but did not have enough information to report the matter to authorities, the indictment said. Another count of the indictment accuses <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> of lying when he denied the agent discussed keeping the large cash loan from being reported to federal regulators.

 More than 200 miners staged a protest rally outside Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s office Monday, complaining about the state's black lung fund and urging that he fire his energy commissioner. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> finally appeared with a state police escort and walked through the demonstrators, greeting some and shaking hands. None in the crowd tried to confront <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> with the demands, which were a mixed bag of complaints about commissioner <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Faerber </PERSON>, a $ 30 million loan from the black lung fund made last fiscal year, and Workers' Compensation Commissioner <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who oversees the black lung fund. The rally was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the political arm of the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>. The committee has endorsed <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s opponent in the governor's race, Democrat <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>. `` I think it's nice they express themselves,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said when asked about the protest. `` And I would hope it's sincere.'' Just after the rally and in the opposite wing of the Capitol, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to consider a petition filed last week by <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> against <PERSON> Faerber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. The petition said <PERSON> Faerber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> have interfered with the operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, which is supposed to review each mine fatality and issue regulations if needed to prevent a recurrence. The court unanimously set arguments for Nov. 2, six days before the election. <PERSON> Faerber </PERSON> denied interfering with the board and said the suit was politically inspired. `` Where's Arch?'' the crowd chanted during the protest outside the governor's office. `` Where is <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>? ... We will not be moved.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whited </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesapeake </PERSON>, who said he was part of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disabled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the miners were angry because of a high death rate in the state's mines and because $ 30 million was borrowed from the miners' black lung fund to help keep state government afloat last fiscal year. But <PERSON> Faerber </PERSON> said last year's mine death rate of nine was the lowest in state history. He said 10 miners have died this year. In addition, the black lung loan was made by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, not the governor's office, although <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> supported it, with the concurrence of the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leadership.

 Political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and six co-defendants pleaded innocent Monday to federal fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with alleged loans to his enterprises. In an arraignment lasting less than 10 minutes, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his associates spoke only once: to swear, `` I do'' to a promise to return to court for trial Nov. 21 and for a hearing on a motion Nov. 10. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> speeded the proceeding by saying that he assumed that all the defendants were pleading innocent and asking for a jury trial. Their lawyers nodded agreement. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was more vocal at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier Monday, calling the indictment `` a heap of garbage'' and asserting, `` I'm certainly not guilty.'' `` This is purely a political stunt,'' the 66-year-old independent candidate for president said. `` Nebulous charges never occur this close to an election except as a dirty trick.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> last Friday on 13 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Conviction on all counts carries a prison term of 65 years and fines of $ 3.25 million. Six of his associates also were charged and face lesser sentences if convicted. The grand jury said their scheme raised more than $ 34 million in loans to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political and commercial groups from individuals nationwide between 1983 and 1987 with no intention of repaying them. The indictment said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> conspired to defraud <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> by having his expenses paid by friends and groups associated with him. It added that he has not filed a federal income tax return since at least 1979. `` This is a screwball charge,'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> said. `` The government does not charge I evaded taxes, because I have made clear I have no money income.'' He said he relied on the gifts of friends and being `` hosted'' by various organizations and conferences. `` There is no tax liability.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> added, `` I had nothing to do with raising $ 34 million.'' He said he had counseled some groups but never had authority over them and that the central organization described in the indictment does not exist. `` This is a malicious, vindictive prosecution,'' he said. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who is campaigning in 12 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, said he believed that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> prevailed on like-minded federal prosecutors in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to seek the indictment, because <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has predicted dire consequences if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said last Friday that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was being treated like any other citizen accused of a crime. The seven defendants were all released on their own personal recognizance but pledged to pay $ 5,000 if they fail to appear for court dates. Judge <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> allowed them unlimited travel in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad so long as they informed the court clerk in advance. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had objected to international travel but was overruled. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> made clear he plans to move the case quickly, saying `` 90 percent of the -LRB- defense -RRB- motions in this case are going to come straight out of the word processor and only two or three or four will require serious thought. The rest I can recite by heart.'' An earlier federal trial of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and other associates in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> ended in a mistrial because jurors objected to the length of the case. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> case is scheduled for retrial in January. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s codefendants in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are his fund-raising chief, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>; his chief legal adviser, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>; and four fund-raisers, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>.

 A homegrown ballet company is hopping mad over the city's invitation to the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>, particularly since the larger company will perform the `` Nutcracker'' a week before its own version. `` We feel terrified,'' <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Metre </PERSON>, artistic director of the local <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` I hate to be in competition with them. It boils down to having money.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Knoxville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has welcomed a plan to have the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> come south for the fall-winter season each year as City Ballet. The council says it's a great way to bring professional, big-city ballet to this east <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> city of 180,000. The smaller company, though, fears losing the audience for its bread-and-butter production _ the popular Christmas classic choreographed to <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s `` Nutcracker Suite.'' Its Nutcracker is scheduled Dec. 4, a week after the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>'s. `` We are a semiprofessional group of local dancers and we've performed in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> and all the surrounding areas for 11 years,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Metre </PERSON>, who studied at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> before returning home to <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> `` -LRB- Nutcracker -RRB- makes the most amount of profit for us. This is how we make our money to exist'' in addition to receiving grant money, she said. Her company, she adds, contributes to the community by bringing ballet to public schools across an area often associated with buck dancing and bluegrass music. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, project director for City Ballet, acknowledged the struggle that the Appalachian Ballet has on its hands but said there was little anyone could do. `` Our feeling is that we're bringing in a different caliber of dance,'' she said. `` This is an opportunity for <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> to have a world-renown dance troupe. `` It's regrettable. I know it's going to be a thorn in their side. We've asked them to come to our meetings to talk about things,'' she said.

<HEAD>House Report Says IRS Failing To Collect Billions in Business
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is losing billions of dollars in tax revenues each year because the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does not use an enforcement program on business taxpayers that it has been using effectively on individuals, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said Monday. A report from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between $ 3.2 billion and $ 8 billion a year in taxes on interest and dividends earned by businesses is never collected because the income is not reported to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. While the revenue loss estimates `` are not statistically precise,'' the report said they provide ample justification for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to include businesses in the document-matching program it now uses to verify interest and dividend earnings on individual tax returns. Under the existing document-matching program, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> compares `` information returns'' detailing interest and dividend payments to individuals with the individuals' actual income tax returns. The program in fiscal 1985 produced $ 2.35 billion in additional tax revenue from individuals. Although banks and corporations are not required to file such information returns on income payments to corporations, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> received _ but never used _ 26 million such returns in 1985, showing income payments to 5 million businesses totaling $ 987 billion. `` By casting these information returns aside, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is not only missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported business tax liabilities but has created a double standard of enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than individuals,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said Monday the agency has not seen the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report and will have no comment until agecny officials can review it. But at a hearing before Barnard's subcommittee last year, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said the costs of implementing a document-matching program for corporations would not be justified by the additional revenue that would be generated. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said the administrative costs of a document-matching program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different names. Although the problems cited by <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> all `` pertain to the way income is reported'' to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> `` never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial document-matching program encompassing those corporations to which the difficulties do not pertain.'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> told the subcommittee last year the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would begin using document-matching to verify income reported on tax returns from single-owner businesses and would initiate a multi-year study to determine the extent of business underreporting of interest and dividend income. He also promised to begin a test program using information returns to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file any income tax return. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said the test program in one district office was so effective the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> now has expanded it to nine more districts and could have a document-matching program ready by next spring to identify non-filers among corporations and partnerships nationwide. But despite such efforts, <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> `` has not been sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated computer matching capabilities to businesses.'' `` Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and every one of their returns will be scrutinized by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' computers for unreported income deserve to know why corporate and partnership returns are being excused from this automatic examination process,'' <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should help the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> set up a document-matching program for corporate returns by enacting legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions report to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> all dividend and interest payments to corporations. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> introduced such legislation earlier this year, but it was never reported out of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Antarctic Ozone Hole Moderates This Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Antarctic `` ozone hole,'' which has raised scientific concern in recent years, seems to have moderated slightly, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The so-called hole is a depletion in the amount of ozone high in the atmosphere over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> region. Some scientists also have found indications of a similar North Pole depletion. This phenomenon was detected in the early 1980s and raised concern because ozone _ a form of oxygen _ helps block harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. That radiation has been associated with skin cancer. Instruments sent up in balloons have found that the amount of ozone in the air above <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> this month averaged 200 <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> units. By comparison, measurements averaged 135 <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> units last October and 165 the October before. They were as high as 250 units in 1980. The <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how much of each of two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed in the air. That ratio changes depending on the concentration of ozone. October, which marks springtime in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, is the time of year when ozone is most depleted over the area, according to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Komhyr </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> However, the apparent improvement does not mean the threat of ozone depletion is reduced, <PERSON> Komhyr </PERSON> said. Rather, it seems to indicate that natural variations in the atmosphere can lead to large year-to-year changes in ozone, he said. The ozone hole occurs within a vortex of west-to-east winds which tend to circle the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> during the winter and spring months. This year, <PERSON> Komhyr </PERSON> noted, the temperatures high in the atmosphere have been a few degrees warmer than during the last two years. The warmer temperatures reduce the formation of clouds in the stratosphere and that may be helping protect the ozone. It is within those clouds that chlorine compounds tend to do the most damage to ozone, <PERSON> Komhyr </PERSON> explained. Reducing the release of chlorine compounds has become a major focus in recent years. They are largely derived from chlorofluorocarbons, man-made gases used in refrigeration, industrial processes and as aerosol propellants in some countries.

<HEAD>Only One US College in Six Requires Language Study</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Only one of six four-year colleges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> requires that all students getting degrees study a foreign language, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The same proportion has raised its foreign language requirement over the past five years. Foreign language requirements in other countries are considerably heavier. It takes seven years of English to graduate from an Israeli high school, for example. A study by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, senior research associate for the council, found that about one in eight of the colleges, 13 percent, requires some foreign language study of all applicants. One in 12 increased its requirement between 1982 and 1987. There was much less interest in languages among two-year community colleges, which are more oriented toward getting jobs for their graduates. Only 1 percent required any foreign language study as a condition of entrance and only about 13 percent required any further instruction for the associate degrees they usually grant. The survey was based on replies from nearly 400 of more than 3,200 institutions listed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brod </PERSON>, who does similar studies for the <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that requirements have been increasing since the late 1970s or early 1980s. He said the trend is based on a recognition of a need for competitiveness against rivalry from other countries. Language requirements here were much heavier before World War II, when a smaller proportion of high school graduates went on to college. `` There was a loosening in the 1950s and 1960s,'' <PERSON> Brod </PERSON> said. `` Then there was a revival _ based partly on the Soviets sending up the first Sputnik -LRB- space satellite -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Brod </PERSON> found language study reaching a peak in 1965-66, and then declining again. `` Now enrollments in foreign language classes are increasing, at a time when enrollments in general are only holding steady,'' he said. The council study also found: _ 77 percent of all four-year colleges require students to take at least one internationally-oriented course, such as Western history or world civilization _ 63 percent of the colleges had programs permitting study in other countries _ 85 percent reported at least some foreign publications in their libraries; among two-year colleges, 32 percent said they had none at all _ Nearly half the four-year colleges increased the number of foreign students in the past five years More than half increased the number of international courses, hired new faculty with knowledge of international affairs and increased the size of the international collections in their libraries.

 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is working with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to raise nearly half a billion dollars urgently needed to save millions of hungry people displaced by floods and war. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plans a worldwide appeal for immediate donations totaling $ 50 million to care for 2 million people displaced in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> by a 5-year-old civil war, according to <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wannop </PERSON>, representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Development Program. In addition, experts from the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on Monday proposed a two-year, $ 407 million reconstruction program from August and September floods that destroyed $ 3.1 billion in property. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest country, has a foreign debt of $ 11 billion. In addition, the government is spending about $ 1 million a day fighting the war in the south, which the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> seems to be winning On Monday, a rebel radio broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> claimed the capture of a sixth southern town in four weeks. The guerrilla war _ fought between <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s Arab Moslem majority in the north and the Christian, animist minority in the south _ has driven almost 2 million people toward the north and east into <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Fighting in the countryside forced the population to abandon farming and cattle-breeding, to trek to government-controlled cities and subsist on relief food, where war or bad weather often blocks the delivery of supplies. Western relief officials say about a million southerners have gathered in and around the capital of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, about 350,000 in western <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and half a million in the rest of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Among those living at the edge of death are about 150,000 people in <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION>, areas just north of the southern battle zone. An estimated 10,000 have starved to death there during the summer. The tragedy has prompted a $ 1 million airlift financed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to the small village of <LOCATION> Abyei </LOCATION>, 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, where relief officials say 10 people are dying every day. The 10-day airlift was half-finished on Monday. Wannop, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> development specialist, said relief organizations plan to use the first $ 50 million relief to move displaced people about 200,000 to 300,000 people from <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION> toward their southern homelands but out of the reach of the fighting. This would keep more refugees from inundating <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, he said, where about 1 million people are living in tin-and-canvas shanty towns after scores have died in floods. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s minister of public communications, Taj el-Sir <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>, said the two-year relief plan he accepted Monday was based on surveys conducted during field work by World Bank experts. The program will be presented to donor countries and contributors next month, he said. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> and Western experts said the study found the heavy rains will help the economy in many ways. The rain ended an 8-year-old drought, and the minister said Sudanese farmers should have bumper harvests this year, with almost 10 times as much land under cultivation as during the drought.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is attempting to reverse a deterioration in living standards by adopting a market-oriented approach to its economy and by attempting to attract foreign investment, a member of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>, who also is a key economic adviser to the Vietnamese government, said a major impetus to the economic policy changes is the `` exploding'' growth rates of most capitalist economies in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Speaking to a luncheon gathering at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group, <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> acknowledged that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is one of the poorest countries in the world. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>, who once taught at two American universities and was an official of both the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the South Vietnamese government, said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is moving away from a centrally planned economy in order to `` free the forces of production.'' He added that the foreign investment code is extremely liberal because <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is entering the competition for outside business `` quite late in the game'' and more advantageous terms are required. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> has conferred with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business executives during his visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But American investment in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is forbidden by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo against that country. Visits by Vietnamese officials to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been rare. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, asking not to be identified, said <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>'s visit apparently was part of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s policy of trying to expand ties to the West. He is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the invitation of several academic institutions. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is one of a handful of countries with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not maintain diplomatic relations. Official U.S.-Vietnamese contacts have been limited mostly to humanitarian issues. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said there can be no progress on developing political relations until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pulls its troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> gives as full accounting as possible of the estimated 1,700 American servicemen still missing from the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s intention to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and said his government also is determined to do what it can to assist on the MIA issue. The two countries recently initiated joint on-site inspections in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in the search for the missing Americans.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The following is the citation by the Nobel Assembly for the 1988 Nobel Prize in medicine announced Monday, and the summary of the winners' achievements as released in an English-language statement: The <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has today decided to award the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for 1988 jointly to Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment. Summary: The discoveries awarded with this year's Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine concern important principles in drug treatment, principles that have resulted in the development of a series of new drugs. Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> realized the great pharmacotherapeutic potential of receptor blocking drugs and developed in 1964 the first clinically useful beta-receptor blocking drug, propranolol. This type of drug is now being used in the treatment of coronary heart disease -LRB- angina pectoris, myocardial infarction -RRB- and hypertension. In 1972 <PERSON> Black </PERSON> characterized a new group of histamine receptors, H2-receptors, and subsequently developed the first clinically useful H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine. A new principle in the treatment of peptic ulcer was thereby introduced. <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, who have collaborated since 1945, demonstrated differences in nucleic acid metabolism between normal human cells, cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and virus. On the basis of such differences a series of drugs were developed that block nucleic acid synthesis in cancer cells and noxious organisms without damaging the normal human cells. Over the years <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hutchings </PERSON>' research philosophy has formed the basis for development of new drugs against a variety of diseases. During 1950-51 they developed thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine against leukemia and pyrimethamine against malaria. Azathioprine, a drug that prevents rejection of transplanted organs and allopurinol which is used in the treatment of gout were developed in 1957 and 1963, respectively. An important discovery was that the chemotherapeutic effects of pyrimethamine and trimethoprim were markedly enhanced by sulphonamides. A recent, successful application of their research ideas is exemplified by acyclovir -LRB- 1977 -RRB-, the first effective drug in the treatment of herpes virus infections.

 A new computer system of evaluating the production potential of dairy cows has been devised to help farmers select only the best animals, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The genetic evaluation system, called the Animal Model, takes into account more of a cow's relatives than does the older system, the Modified Contemporary Comparison, which has been used since 1974, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Under the new system, milk production of a cow's daughters will be considered when the mother is being evaluated. And the evaluation of bulls, based in part on the records of the male's offspring, also take into account the impact of the bull's mate on those offspring The new system will be used for the first time in dairy genetic evaluations to be prepared in July 1989, the report said. The information then will be reported to dairy farmers, who can use it to decide which cows and their calves to keep in the herd. `` With this information in hand, the farmer can select with more accuracy the calves likely to be the most efficient milk producers,'' the report said.

 A gunman took a 74-year-old woman hostage after he was foiled in an attempt to steal $ 1 million in jewelry belonging to the late <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, but police shot and killed the man outside the entertainer's museum. `` I just tried to stay cool,'' said hostage <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>, who sat down to give police a clear shot at the man and escaped unharmed in Sunday evening's incident at the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. `` The man had a bag of tools, including a crowbar, and was going to smash into the jewelry case,'' said <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, administrator of the museum and sister-in-law of the late entertainer. `` He wanted the jewelry and he came prepared to take it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>, who has worked at the museum 10 years, was closing the office when the man appeared, saying he wanted to deliver a plant, Mrs. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> said. The man produced a gun, forced his way inside and refused offers of money, Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> offered him the day's receipts, even offered him the money in her purse, but he was n't interested,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> said. `` He said ` I do n't want the cash. I want the jewelry.' He obviously had been in there before and checked out the place. He seemed to know where everything was.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> was able to warn a cleaning woman, who slipped out a back door and called police. The gunman tied Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>'s hands and feet, taped her mouth, then untied her, moved her to another part of the museum and tied her again. `` He was getting ready to pop the jewelry case when he heard a noise outside,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said. `` He went and saw the police. I told him I'd get him out the back door. When we tried that, police were there, too.'' The gunman walked out the front door with a gun pointed at the bound hostage. `` He told police he would shoot me if they did n't let him get to his car,'' she recalled. `` I just tried to stay cool.'' `` She just sat down on the sidewalk, pretending her legs had collapsed under her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> said. `` He tried to lift her in the car but could n't. He leaned back for a minute and the police shot him.'' `` When I sat down I figured the police would pick him off, maybe,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>, somewhat shaken and her hands still bearing marks from the ropes, was back at work Monday. `` I thought I was better off working than staying at home and dwelling on it,'' she said. The gunman, identified as <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, had a lengthy arrest record dating back to the 1960s, said <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The museum is one of the city's top tourist attractions, featuring memorabilia of the entertainer who gained fame here and retained a home not far away. Mrs. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> said the museum has one of the most sophisticated security systems in the city but will now add guards. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, who died in February 1987 of complications due to AIDS, founded the museum 10 years ago to fund the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts, which provides scholarships for music and art students at 27 colleges and universities across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet spokesman on Monday refused to define the duties of former Soviet ideology chief <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> but denied that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> or anyone else is No. 2 on the ruling Politburo. `` All members of the Politburo are equal and some are more equal than others,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, paraphrasing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>'s satire of communist society in the novel `` Animal Farm.'' But he said President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has no official second-in-command despite Western reports that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> once chaired meetings of the 12-member ruling body of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has been considered the top conservative rival of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is waging a campaign for economic and political reform. `` What you call No. 2 does n't exist,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters at a government news briefing. Still, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> appeared Monday at <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s right side at the opening of a national conference of doctors in the Kremlin. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> left strong doubts whether <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> came out of a recent Politburo power play with control over agriculture, traditionally the nation's toughest assignment. After being deprived of the key ideology portfolio this year, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was named chairman of a new <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> commission on agriculture in a shake-up of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership Sept. 30. Since the core of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> apparatus will consist of just six of these commissions, the job was hardly a removal from power, but it clearly gave <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> less clout than his former post as overseer of ideology. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> hedged when he was asked point-blank who is controlling agriculture _ <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, or fellow Politburo member <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON>, who had that job before the shake-up. `` It is the commission'' that will run agriculture, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. Specific duties are still evolving, and those of <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON> have yet to be defined, he said. At a similar briefing several days ago, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> promised to explain what <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON>'s new duties are. Last week, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was notably absent from an important agriculture conference where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> edged closer to dismantling the collective farm system controlled from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with a plan to allow farmers to lease fields nationwide. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was on vacation during the meeting and that he did n't have to be present for all discussions of farm issues. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has publicly doubted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness on selected topics. He was reported losing his grip on power and the ideology job in April, when reports said he was `` on vacation'' after receiving a reprimand from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The former party bureaucrat from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> rose to the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a key job assigning party personnel under former Soviet leader <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> in 1983. He joined the Politburo in 1985. <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON> is an agriculture expert with roots in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s home soil in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, and his career climbed with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became party chief for agriculture in 1978, <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON> became deputy Soviet minister for agriculture, essentially a top aide in the parallel government bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Too Many Mickeys in Moscow, Disney Says</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> met <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this weekend, but it was the wrong rodent. `` A bad copy,'' <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said ruefully Monday, describing the costumed figure who has been enticing parents into ordering pictures of their children from a state photographer on the Arbat pedestrian mall. Such counterfeiting is a big obstacle keeping Soviet children from enjoying the same Disney fantasies as their foreign counterparts. A Soviet festival of Disney films is playing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but it wo n't expand beyond that until the counterfeiting issue is solved, said <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, a vice chairman of the company. Disney films have not been shown in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since a lone appearance in a film festival 50 years ago, according to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media. Yet, the company's cartoon characters are popular motifs for Soviet fashion. Unfortunately for Disney, none of the manufacturers has paid a penny in royalties. `` We need to talk it out,'' <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said. Soviet officials are aware that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> requires protection of its `` intellectual property'' through copyrights or similar means, he added. Disney would like to show its films, sell <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> ears and publish its familiar books and music in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said. But <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> added that he expects no concrete deals on this visit, because the intellectual property issue must be settled first. Disney is discussing possible joint productions with the Soviet film agency, but this requires a story best filmed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said. Soviet officials said earlier they were discussing Disney involvement in building `` Wonderland,'' a planned theme park. In answer to a question, however, <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said he doubted his company would ever build a Soviet version of <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Regulating Indian Gambling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday signed legislation setting up a commission to regulate and monitor high-stakes gambling on Indian reservations. The legislation provides for joint regulation by the tribes and the federal government of bingo, lotto, and certain card games. It would permit casinos, and horse and dog racing on reservations only if the tribes enter into specific contracts with state governments. Indian tribes, faced with cutbacks in federal money and a limited tax base, have instituted gambling operations to raise needed revenues. Bingo is the predominant, but not the only, form of gambling. Bingo, lotto, and card games will be monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to be established. Card games will be subject to state regulations regarding hours of play and betting limits. Other forms of gambling, including casinos, horse and dog racing, and jai-alai, will require tribes to enter into compacts with the states. The national commission will be composed of five people, three of whom must be members of federally recognized tribes. The president would appoint the chairman, who would need <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The commission is empowered under the act to close tribal games permanently, enforce the collection of fines, conduct background investigations of employees, and monitor all Indian gaming activities. The measure also authorizes $ 2 million for the first year of the commission's operation, and requires that its operation be financed at least 50 percent by the tribes, through assessments on gaming revenues. The remainder would be paid by federal appropriations.

 Lawyers representing 24 Britons charged with involuntary manslaughter in a 1985 fatal soccer riot appealed Monday for a fair trial as the proceedings opened. Families of some of the 39 people killed in the <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> stadium riot attended the trial, which was interrupted twice by bomb threats. `` This trial must restore the honor which <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> lost in the <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> stadium,'' said defense lawyer <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Moureaux </PERSON>. `` It must be a fair trial. The court should not try to choke the truth. Justice must repair everything.'' Also present were some of the survivors of the riot, which injured 400 people. One Frenchman, who refused to identify himself, said outside the courtroom that he survived the stampede and added: `` When I see them -LRB- the British fans -RRB- laughing, I could kill them.'' The stampede began when the fence separating British and Italian fans at the European Cup soccer final between <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Juventuis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> broke, Britons charged, Italians retreated in panic and the 39 were trampled to death. Belgian police forces were blamed for their incapacity to quell the riot. <PERSON> Moureaux </PERSON> quoted a Belgian state police sergeant as telling investigators: `` I never saw such a lack of command.'' The incident provoked the resignation of Belgian government several months later. <PERSON> Moureaux </PERSON> quoted a Belgian state police sergeant as telling investigators: `` I never saw such a lack of command.'' The sergeant reportedly added that he saw a police officer run away from the riots. Another defense lawyer, <PERSON> Georges-Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauthier </PERSON>, asked the court president to reject videocassettes of the incident. He also rejected the alleged identification by Italian witnesses of the defendents from photographs. `` We fear the immolation of a few of our clients on the altar of collective frenzy,'' he said. `` We do n't find it good and comfortable to condemn a few people chosen at random from films to reassure public opinion.'' The defendents, if convicted, face up to 10 years in jail. The proceedings are expected to last at least until Christmas.

<TEXT>
 A house-to-house survey of nearly 800 low-income families in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state suggests that as many as 5 million of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children suffer from hunger, a private activist group said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> And </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is extending the study to seven other states over the next 15 months. But on the basis of the early data from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state `` ... we estimate conservatively that 2 million to 5 million children in this country could now have a serious hunger problem,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON>, executive director of the center. `` We believe that this estimate is conservative because it attempts only to estimate the number of children living in poverty who might be hungry,'' said <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON>. `` It does not include any children from families with incomes above the poverty line who might be hungry.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON> acknowledged that he has no way of knowing whether the survey results in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state will be replicated in larger studies. Similar studies are now under way in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The survey techiques were first used in a 1986 survey in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and refined for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and ongoing studies, all of which involve selecting low-income families at random and then conducting face-to-face interviews that take about 45 minutes each. The responses given by mothers to a lengthy questionnaire are correlated with other information such as family income and what, if any, public assistance such as food stamps they receive. Among the questions: Does your household ever run out of money to buy food to make a meal? Do your children ever eat less than you feel they should because there is not enough money for food? A respondent had to answer `` yes'' to at least five such questions before being placed in the hunger category. Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidel </PERSON>, a professor of social medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, headed the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s technical advisory committee and said the survey techniques used are the best yet developed for measuring hunger. `` The evidence is in. The evidence is clear. The evidence is scientific,'' he said. <PERSON> Sidel </PERSON> emphasized that the kind of hunger seen among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children is not of the dramatic, life-threatening variety common in <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries But he said there are `` other kinds of medical and physical consequences'' inexcusable in a country as rich as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is a violation of equality of opportunity to force -LRB- poor -RRB- children to go to school hungry,'' said <PERSON> Sidel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON> said one major finding of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state study is that it shows `` people do not supplement to the extent the food stamp program assumes'' the amount of assistance they get from that particular <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program. The reason, he said, is that they are paying ever higher prices for rent, child care and medical costs. `` The food budget is the most elastic,'' he said, and that is what is cut first. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state was not singled out because hunger was believed better or worse, but as an outgrowth of the Governor's Task Force on Hunger created there in 1986 to try to document the extent and nature of hunger in the state. The <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> relies on the support of foundations, religious groups, corporations, individuals and others to carry out its hunger and poverty programs.

 Guerrillas continued fighting government troops at camps near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border Monday after capturing several hills controlled by the military regime, a government spokesman said. The ethnic <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> guerrillas first attacked the camps near <LOCATION> Methawaw </LOCATION>, about 130 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, on Sept. 26. Since then, they have killed 35 government soldiers, including one officer, and wounded 95, said government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. Three others were missing, he said. Rebel casualties were believed heavy, but a count was not possible because the guerrillas dragged away their dead and wounded, <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said. Methawaw is on the west bank of the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms the border between <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The Karens, who are fighting for the autonomy of an area along the border, form the strongest of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s dozen insurgencies. Karens represent about 2 million of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 38 million people. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said about 1,000 guerrillas were involved in the attacks near <LOCATION> Methawaw </LOCATION>. The guerrillas said they recaptured several hills Wednesday in an area government forces had seized more than four years ago. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said government troops also attacked two other <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> strongholds, at <LOCATION> Maela </LOCATION> on Oct. 9 and at <LOCATION> Wangkha </LOCATION> on Oct. 13. Seven soldiers were killed and 24 were injured, and fierce fighting continued at <LOCATION> Wangkha </LOCATION> on Monday, he said. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> also said students who recently fled to the border areas to join the guerrillas must return by Nov. 18 or they will be regarded as rebels. He said the government has established `` reception centers'' at 27 towns in areas bordering <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. `` The government regarded these students as youths misled and gone astray,'' he said. `` They will be welcomed at reception centers where they will be well looked after before sending them back to their respective homes. We will have to regard them as rebels after the deadline of Nov. 18.'' Officials of various rebel groups say more than 9,000 students and other civilians have arrived at rebel camps since military commander Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> Sept. 18 and crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in the cities. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> announced that two more political parties registered Monday, bringing to 20 the number formed after <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s coup. The two parties, the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have elderly leaders who were politically active before <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> achieved its independence in 1948.

<HEAD>CDC To Study Possible Victims Of Radioactive Spills At Hanford</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Government researchers are investigating whether as many as 20,000 people who lived near the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state in the 1940s and early 1950s were contaminated by radioactive spills. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said the leakage over about nine years of several radioactive elements, especially Iodine 131, apparently is the most massive radioactive leak of any facility in the country. The reservation opened in 1944 and produced the plutonium for the atom bomb that destroyed <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in 1945. `` A lot of Iodine 131 was released into the atmosphere at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which is doing the study He said research in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> indicated Iodine 131 can cause thyroid problems. Records of the Hanford leak and the size of the dose were not released until a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, environmental group obtained them in 1986 under the Freedom of Information Act. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month authorized the study, which <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said may take 5 years and cost up to $ 6 million. He said there is no proof yet that there have been long-range damaging effects from the radiation spill. `` It's all anecdotal so far,'' he said. `` The most difficult task will be to find the people, to reassemble the populations and try and track them down.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> will use birth and school records to try to find people who lived downwind, to the west, of the nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` That will be our hardest job,'' he said. `` I imagine they have spread out all over the place.'' He said Iodine 131 has a radioactive half-life of only eight days, thus deteriorates quickly and does not linger in the environment and remain a problem. Some radioactive materials are thought to remain dangerous for centuries. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the reservation, also is trying to determine the size of the dose nearby residents may have received. There are nine nuclear reactors at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> and eight are closed permanently. The ninth was placed on `` cold standby'' earlier this year after the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided not to restart it after safety improvements were completed. A plutonium processing plant continues to operate. Last May, about 50 people who lived near <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> to discuss possible related health problems. June Casey of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> in December 1949, when high levels of Iodine 131 were released, said she soon developed an underactive thyroid and lost her hair, which never grew back. <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON>, a third-generation farmer who grew up near <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, said she and her entire family had been stricken with thyroid and cancer problems. She said she has had cancer twice in the past eight years and that her oldest son developed a bone tumor two years ago.

<TEXT>
 A researcher experimenting with a new, more sensitive test for the AIDS virus said Monday that the virus does not appear to be carried in sperm cells. That discovery could eventually mean that men with AIDS could father children by separating their sperm cells from infected semen and using those cells for artificial insemination. Semen, which is ejaculated, is made up of both sperm cells and seminal fluid. But Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, said it's a discovery that needs more study. `` All we're saying is that we have a test that's so good we can detect these things and now we need to do some very carefully conducted clinical tests,'' <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said. He said he would n't recommend that men infected with AIDS attempt to pursue fatherhood through artificial insemination and he does n't think fertility clinics or in vitro centers would agree to try this without further testing. <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said determining whether the AIDS virus is carried inside a sperm cell is one of many studies to exploit a new means of testing for the AIDS virus. The new technique, developed by <ORGANIZATION> Cetus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, uses a chemical reaction, called a polymerase chain reaction, to amplify genetic material _ such as that from the AIDS virus _ a million times, making it easier to detect. <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said the test is faster, more accurate and cheaper than some current AIDS tests. Another finding with the new test, <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said, is a decline in the number of men with AIDS who have the virus in their semen. Other researchers using the test have documented similar findings, he said. <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said he has looked at 500 semen samples over the past four or five years, and that over that period, even with a more sensitive test, the number of samples containing the virus has fallen. Initially, about 75 percent of the men had the virus in their semen, but recently <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said researchers have found the virus in just 20 percent of homosexual men who had similar characteristics as the initial group. `` We think this is because they have fewer white blood cells in their semen,'' said <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON>. `` As a result of safe sex and better care, we believe the amount of infections and level of inflammation has been reduced.'' Without the infections and inflammations, the number of white blood cells decreases, <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said. This is another finding that needs to be studied, but <PERSON> Poisez </PERSON> said it could eventually mean that researchers could determine when it's especially dangerous to have even safe sex. He said researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> are currently studying whether the test can be used to determine: _ how effective about six or seven AIDS-fighting drugs are by measuring how quickly they are reducing the number of AIDS-infected cells in the body. _ whether some mothers infected with AIDS would be better candidates for pre-natal use of AIDS-fighting drugs. _ If there are particular times when it's more likely for an unusually large number of AIDS-infected cells to be present in the semen.

 The government announced the award of nearly $ 7 million for construction of health care facilities specifically for AIDS patients on Monday, the first federal money to be directed for such programs. `` The awards went to facilities that were able to demonstrate a comprehensive, cost-effective approach to providing care,'' <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said in a statement. `` A variety of traditional and nontraditional facilities received the funds, which are to be regarded as seed money.'' With nearly 300,000 people expected to be suffering from AIDS within three years _ compared with about 75,000 diagnosed so far _ a major challenge facing the health care industry is for cost-effective ways to care for such patients. AIDS sufferers often are not in constant need of the costly care supplied by acute-care hospitals, yet are too sick to be cared for at home. The grants announced Monday were to 19 facilities in nine states to renovate or construct non-acute care intermediate and long-term care facilities for patients with AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The nine states are <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said the grant recipients had to guarantee that a reasonable volume of services would be provided to patients unable to pay and that services must be made available to all people living or working in a facility's service area.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for subway gunman <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> asked the state's highest court Monday to give weight to `` little words'' and overturn a gun possession conviction stemming from his 1984 shooting of four teen-agers. Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>'s charge to jurors last year that they `` must'' convict if they found the prosecution had proven its case, amounted to taking away the jury's constitutionally granted discretion <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the judge should have used the word `` may.'' `` That's what this profession is all about, much ado about little words,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said after his court appearance. `` The word ` must' to a conscientious jury precludes it from perhaps exercising its own discretion.'' However, during the hearing, Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellacosa </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> about the possibility that judges might be giving jurors a show-mercy message with `` a wink and a nod'' if they did n't tell them of their duty to convict if the case against the defendant had been proved. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON>, an assistant district attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, raised the same concern in arguing that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s conviction should be upheld. <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> said that for trial judges to be forced to use `` may'' instead of `` must'' would be `` a red flag in some cases for jurors to decide cases on their personal predilections and contrary to the rule of law.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that if juries were n't allowed to have some discretion, `` then we do n't need a jury, we need a computer.'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who was not at Monday's hearing, ca n't expect a decision from the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for several weeks. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, an electronics technician, was convicted in June 1987 of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon in connection with the December 1984 shooting aboard a subway train of four black youths he said were trying to rob him. The youths, who all survived, said they were simply panhandling for money. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was acquitted of all other charges against him. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s case drew national attention with supporters claiming he was a hero who reacted properly to a wave of subway and street crime. Opponents complained that his supporters were glorifying vigilantism. A year ago this week, <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> to six months in jail, 280 hours of community service, five years probation and psychiatric counseling, and fined him $ 5,000. On the initial appeal of <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s conviction, a lower state court refused to throw out the conviction, but did order that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> be re-sentenced on the prison portion of his penalty. The Appellate Division of state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> should have been given an indeterminate sentence or, under terms of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s tough gun-control law, a one-year term with no probation. While <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s attorneys have fought to have the conviction itself overturned and get a new trial on the weapons possession charge, they have favored a one-year jail term rather than six months. Because of a quirk in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s law, the six-month sentence meant <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> would have had to serve at least four months before he could be released, while with a one-year sentence he could have been freed after just two months. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is `` trying to get on with his life'' and `` does travel around the country servicing his clients'' as an electronics expert. He said that while <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> still rides the subway, he probably does n't carry a gun. `` I certainly hope not,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` I do n't want to have to go through this again.''

 Two <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> researchers who won the Nobel prize for medicine Monday said the best reward for their work was seeing people overcome disease with the medicines they developed. `` There's nothing that gives you a lift like seeing somebody get better from a serious disease,'' said biochemist <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>. `` The Nobel is something that is going to disappear in a few days. But the other -LRB- seeing patients recover -RRB- is permanent. `` Not taking anything away from the Nobel prize, but the prize is recognition, not reward,'' she said. `` The reward is seeing the improvement your work makes.'' `` I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, a colleague of Ms. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>'s at <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I've had a lot of honors, but the most important honors for me have been meeting patients whose lives have been saved or whose children's lives have been saved by drugs I've invented. <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, 83, and Ms. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>, 70, began collaborating 44 years ago, and have developed drugs for use against leukemia, malaria, gout, organ transplant rejection, herpes virus infections and bacterial infections. Both carry the title scientist emeritus and are officially retired but come to the lab daily. The Nobel Assembly at <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said their ideas also paved the way for development of azidothymidine, or AZT, which is the best documented drug so far in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the only one approved for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> scientists share the $ 390,000 prize with Sir <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

Ms. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> said she had not known she had been nominated for the prize and had never seriously considered that she might win it. `` The only people who thought I might get it was my family,'' she said. `` When I got the first call from a reporter about 6:30 a.m., I told him I thought it was a practical joke and not a very funny one.'' Although she officially retired five years ago, she makes daily trips to <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> to consult with other researchers. `` What's the use of retiring?'' she said. `` If you do n't have anything to contribute anymore, people will tell you.

 The Bethel Home for Children is back in business as a religious boarding school for troubled youths, four months after the state tried to take custody of its students because of reports of abuse. Some of the children who had been under the care of the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, a former heroin addict turned independent Baptist pastor, have returned since the June confrontations, and a few new students have enrolled. Religious boarding homes are n't regulated under <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> law, but several lawmakers concerned about schools like <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION>'s say they'll offer various licensing and registration bills when the Legislature convenes in January. No charges have been filed against anyone at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> in connection with the allegations of abuse and neglect. However, several children's testimony of abusive practices resulted in their removal from Fountain's custody. Next week, a grand jury will consider whether to charge Fountain with assaulting law officers when they stormed his church and took custody of some of his students. A girl answering the telephone Monday at the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children said Fountain was out working and unavailable for comment. Fountain has claimed his right to freedom of religion exempts him from any state oversight, and says there's nothing wrong with his `` spare the rod, spoil the child'' view of discipline. However, state welfare officers were ordered June 10 to take custody of the residents of Fountain's home and school, on a 28-acre compound outhside the southern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. The order came from a <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge looking into several allegations of beatings and other abuse. Some state officials say <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> told the children to flee before welfare officers arrived; he denies this. However, many of the youths _ there were up to 120 at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, according to Fountain _ took off, and law officers spent several days rounding them up from the streets. Fountain says 50 troubled youths have never been accounted for and he fears they are roaming the streets as prostitutes or drug dealers. On June 13, law officers stormed Fountain's locked church to take custody of some of the children who had fled three days before. Several witnesses, including members of the news media, saw Fountain swing at officers during the incident. A <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> grand jury will consider whether to bring three counts of felony assault on a law officer against Fountain. The pastor has been free on bond pending the grand jury session. He has appealed a separate disorderly conduct conviction in <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, for which he was fined $ 200. A civil contempt hearing involving Fountain's refusal to give <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> authorities a list of names of children who had lived at his home is set for Oct. 25 in <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>, a clerk said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday praised Roman Catholic schools for teaching young people spiritual values as well as the educational basics. Addressing students of two parochial high schools in northeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` it amazes me that while you are exploring the mysteries of God's love and all that goes with it ... others around the nation deny the public importance of the private virtues you are mastering.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, accompanied by Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, visited <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where students of that school were gathered in a gymnasium with students from <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The president said he believes the government should do more to help parents who wish to send their children to parochial schools. `` Catholic schools across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are showing that private virtue and public interest do indeed live together,'' he said. `` I know that your parents all make great sacrifices so that you can come here. ... For years, I have been urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow your parents to support your education either through tuition tax credits or vouchers.'' `` We need a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that shares and supports the values of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the young people for preparing themselves for leadership positions in the future. `` Is n't that because you are not only learning the ABCs but also about right and wrong, good and evil, and the nature of God's love? he said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Comatose Patient May Have Feeding Tubes
Removed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A comatose woman has a constitutional right to have her feeding tubes removed, despite objections by a state attorney that she would starve to death, a federal judge ruled Monday. An individual has a constitutional right to control fundamental medical decisions affecting one's own body, even if that will result in death, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. `` Medical ethics incorporates the principle that the patient, not the health care provider, determines what the course of care should be,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 49, has been in a coma since Jan. 4, 1986, when a blood vessel burst in her brain. She had told her husband and relatives on several occasions that, if stricken, she would not want to be kept alive by artificial means, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s opinion noted. Although she breathes on her own, doctors agree she suffered massive brain damage and is in a `` persistent vegetative state,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s decision said. The case attracted national attention last year when <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> approved a theologian's opinion that it was morally permissible to withdraw Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s nourishment. That opinion, which has been criticized by other moral theologians, said Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s feeding was `` circumventing'' the dying process. Her husband and guardian, <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, asked to have her feeding tube removed in March 1987. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which is run by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, Retardation and Hospitals, refused, setting up the state's first legal test of a patient's right to die. Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has a constitutional right to privacy, and `` the right to protect one's bodily integrity,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, attorney for the <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> family, argued at a June hearing. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breguet </PERSON>, the state's attorney, argued that no federal constitutional issues were involved and, even if they were, implementation of those standards was `` really up to the individual states to decide.'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said an argument by <PERSON> Breguet </PERSON> that Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> would suffer a painful death was `` hollow in light of the medical testimony that <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is incapable of suffering any sensation, including pain.'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> ruled that if Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> can not be promptly transferred to a health care facility that will respect her wishes, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> must remove the feeding tubes. General <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> will try to find another facility to accept Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, and failing that, will consider appealing the decision, <PERSON> Breguet </PERSON> said Monday after speaking with <ORGANIZATION> MHRH </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, who was the defendant in the lawsuit.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Monday his country would accept a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> formula for implementing a peace pact in its 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> but on one condition, the official Iranian news agency reported. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as saying the condition is that a 1975 accord that placed the southern border between the two countries as running through the middle of the Shatt al-Arab waterway be maintained. The dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> proposed the compromise plan and listed its four points as: withdrawal of all forces to international boundaries; agreement not to search ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>; exchange of prisoners of war, and dredging of the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON>. The dispute over the estuary, which is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only waterway access to the gulf, was a key issue in the war. Peace talks that started Aug. 25 stalled quickly over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence that the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> be dredged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed that was a secondary issue that could be settled later. Peace negotiations are scheduled to resume later this month in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to the Iranian announcement, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejected the 1975 treaty years ago. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists that the pact, known as the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> Treaty, is valid. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> tore up a copy of the 1975 treaty in a televised broadcast five days before his troops invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> was quoted as saying Monday that `` future peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> will be fruitful if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> relents its current obstinacy and is ready to cooperate for the implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's plan.'' The agency said <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> made the comments at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. It reported <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also made these statement on other matters: _ <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> will not change its policy toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as long as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> continues its `` hostile behavior'' toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ Talks with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> about restoring relations were continuing and `` can not be said to have reached a deadlock. _ `` Some difficulties'' exist in relations with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which in April severed diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, accusing it of supporting terrorists.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> on Monday told the first meeting of his Cabinet that the new government begins its work `` in conditions of substantial disorder.'' `` Only palpable, measurable effects of improvement can overcome the attitude of hopelessness in society,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said, according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency. It said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> also declared that law and order must be maintained and accused anti-government protesters who demonstrated Sunday of trying to block planned talks between the communist authorities and the opposition. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became prime minister Sept. 27 and his Cabinet was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, last Friday. Polish television broadcast scenes of hundreds of pro-Solidarity demonstrators marching Sunday in the port city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> _ birthplace of the now-outlawed independent trade union movement _ and then demonstrators hurling stones at riot police. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said: `` The government holds the opinion that the manifestations of political adventurism ... were provocations aimed at torpedoing national agreement,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. Such incidents `` drastically disturb the atmosphere'' before the promised round-table discussions, he said, adding: `` The government discussed indispensable measures to counteract attempts at destabilizing the country and to enforce law and public order.'' Round-table talks that would include the topics of trade unions and political and economic reforms had been expected to begin this week, but disagreements over the way they would be conducted and who would participate have forced a delay, said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a mediator attempting to arrange the discussions. The government has said Solidarity representatives would not be allowed to participate. Other opposition leaders turned down offers to join the new government pending results of the talks, but <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told his Cabinet the government would carry out reforms before the negotiations begin. It reported he said restructuring the economy `` must be radicalized and accelerated,'' market supplies increased and price increases curbed. Economic reform will mean that `` people who want to work better ... can count on increased incomes,'' he said. Referring to strikes that shook <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in May and August, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said, `` The sources of conflicts have not disappeared. Thus, the welfare of workers and all working people, their needs and perceptions, must remain at the center of the government's attention. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s top leader, attended the meeting and called the new Cabinet `` a government of great opportunity,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. It reported the general spoke of `` various kinds of provocation'' but said authorities remain `` fully and deeply convinced about the necessity for reconciliation.''

<HEAD>Administration OKs Use of Temporary-Hire Firms at Federal Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Monday proposed allowing understaffed government agencies to hire temporary employee services to fill short-term manpower needs in peak service periods and as substitutes for absent federal workers. Reversing a two-decade policy that banned use of temporary help suppliers except for a few rare instances, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said the new policy will increase agencies' flexibility in times and areas of labor shortages. The new policy, published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> and scheduled to become effective in December or January, amends rulings in 1967 and 1968 that effectively prohibited using temporary help firms as a violation of civil service laws. <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, in an address Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> at its convention in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, contended the new policy will benefit federal employees as well as the agencies they work for. `` By permitting agencies to use temporaries ... we make it far easier for managers to say ` yes' to employees who need time off for family responsibilities,'' she said. `` And by allowing agencies to use temporary help services, we ensure that managers can get the replacement help they need when they need it.'' Government employee unions immediately attacked the proposal, calling it the administration's latest attempt to contract out work now performed by their civil service members. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the government would pay `` significantly more'' by contracting with suppliers of temporary workers than if it hired more temporary workers directly by offering them higher pay. <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> said a beginning clerk-typist under civil service is now paid between $ 13,500 and $ 15,000 a year, or $ 6 to $ 7 an hour. `` In the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area, temporary help suppliers are charging anywhere from $ 12 to $ 15 an hour for a person,'' he said. `` It would be a lot cheaper if they cut out the middleman and offered to increase the pay by 20 percent.'' Under the new regulations, an agency could use temporary help services only in cases in which a regular federal employee is absent because of emergency, accident, maternity leave or illness, or to fill a short-term gap when a worker is transferred or their job is being contracted out. But temporary help services also could be relied upon if the work `` is in a shortage occupation which the agency is aggressively seeking to fill permanently.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafferty </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the government is facing large shortages of clerical workers and secretaries in high-cost cities where unemployment rates are low. Specifically, he cited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, called the second provision a `` loophole'' that would allow widescale use of temporary workers and substantial abuses to the detriment of a permanent civil service. `` It's a copout as far as we're concerned,'' he said. `` They're having a hard time filling these jobs because they do n't pay enough. Some agencies already have latitude to use temporary help agencies in special circumstances. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been utilizing them since the end of World War II to supplement their crews during peak fire seasons. The new policy would limit the use of any one employee from a temporary help service to 45 working days during a six-month period. Temporaries also could not be used more than 90 working days a year for a particular position or to displace any current federal employee.

<HEAD>Economic Gaps Widens Between Black And White Families</HEAD>

 Increases in poverty rates and income stagnation among blacks have helped push the economic gap between black and white families below figures from the late 1970s and 1960s, a private research organization said Monday. A study by the liberal-oriented Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded that both black married and single-parent families lost economic ground behind white families during the last decade. `` In 1987, the income of the typical black family _ at $ 18,098 _ equaled just 56.1 percent of the typical white family's income -LRB- $ 32,274 -RRB-, a lower percentage than any year in the late 1970s or late 1960s -LRB- 59.2 percent -RRB-,'' center Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said in a statement. Median family income for black families decreased by $ 854 between 1978 and 1987, while the median income for white families increased $ 276, the study said. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said the center, which studies government spending and public policy issues as they affect low - and moderate-income Americans, used 1978 as a comparison year because economic conditions, such as overall unemployment rates -LRB- 6.2 percent in 1978 -RRB-, were similar to those of 1987 -LRB- 6.1 percent -RRB- `` Black unemployment has dropped significantly in recent years, but this has not been matched by comparable increases in black family income and declines in black poverty,'' he said. `` The evidence indicates that declines in wages for black workers, compared to the 1970s, and budget cuts at both federal and state levels in programs for low-income families have contributed to black economic slippage,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. The study said that, after adjusting for inflation, the typical black full-time black worker earned $ 315 a week in 1987 _ figure lower than that in any year in the 1970s when the wages ranged from $ 340 to $ 330. This is compared to the 1987 salary given to their white counterparts, whose salary ranged hovered around $ 420 throughout the 1970s. Regionally, income disparities between black and white families have increased since the late 1970s everywhere except in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the study said. The gap widened most in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where typical black family income was nearly $ 4,700 lower in 1987 than in the late 1970s, while the income of the typical white family was only $ 700 below the late-1970s figures. The most recent figures, for 1987, indicate that black median family income was 63.4 percent of white income in the West, 58.6 percent in the Northeast, 56.3 percent in the South and 52.1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The study noted the growing income disparity between blacks and whites is a result of the growing income gap between upper - and lower-income families in the nation as a whole `` In 1987, the gap reached its widest point in 40 years,'' it said, as `` the poorest two-fifths of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families received 15.4 percent of the national family income in both 1986 and 1987, their lowest share since the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> first collected data in 1947.'' Conversely, the richest one-fifth of all families received 43.7 percent of the national family income in 1986 and 1987, the highest percentage on record, it said. Other findings included: _ Poverty rates for both blacks and whites climbed above levels in the 1970s, with 2 million more blacks and 8 million more Americans overall living in poverty in 1987 than in 1978 _ Despite a fifth year of economic recovery, the black poverty rate rose from 31.1 percent in 1986 to 33.1 percent in 1987, while the white poverty rate declined from 11 percent to 10.5 percent _ Budget reductions in programs for low-income households has disproportionately affected blacks, who are three times more likely than whites to be poor

 First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed regret Monday that she failed to heed the advice of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawyers that she formally disclose her borrowing of gowns and other designer apparel. But her press secretary and a government ethics spokesman said there was no legal requirement that she do so. Press Secetary <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> acknowledged that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had reported such loans when the issue first arose in November 1981, saying the first lady then decided `` to err on the side'' of compliance with the law. Since 1982, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has continued to borrow and return items without reporting the transactions, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said, even though <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawyers originally had recommended disclosure as a precautionary measure. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regrets that she failed to heed counsel's advice,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said in a formal statement late Monday `` Nevetheless, no reporting rules or laws were violated.'' A spokesman for the Office of Government Ethics confirmed that the office had supported a conclusion of then-White House Counsel Fred Fielding in 1982 that such reporting was not required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. `` The apparel Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received was either paid for, given to her personally as gifts by old friends and not subject to reporting, or loaned to her and returned. All reporting requirements were met,'' the statement released by Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the ethics office, said officials there agreed with Fielding's contention that no reporting was required under the act _ and said that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been operating under that guidance since that time. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said officials in the federal ethics office had received a letter from Fielding in which `` he laid out the fact that the first lady had borrowed certain gowns for certain events and, in his opinion, that was not something that needed to be reported.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said that <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, then the director of the federal ethics office, agreed with Fielding's conclusion. But he also said in a telephone interview that `` since the question has been raised, we will look at it again, to see if we made the right decision.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not considered an official or employee of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and is therefore not required to file her own disclosure form _ as the president must do on an annual basis. She did make the initial disclosures of clothes transactions on her husband's disclosure form covering 1981 in what <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> described as `` an abundance of caution.'' The issue was raised anew by the current issue of Time magazine. It said that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has continued to accept and to wear expensive evening gowns and other outfits, furnished by leading couturiers such as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, without reporting the practice. `` There are no taxpayers' dollars that go toward the first lady's wardrobe whatsoever,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The spokeswoman said she thought the story was unmerited. `` I think she -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- has made Americans so proud'' of the way she has represented them at official events, the press secretary said. `` For any first lady, there have been mounds of things that you have to go to, and you have to borrow, and it's not illegal.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said `` there have been things that have been borrowed since 1982 _ and they were returned.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` upset over these attacks'' on the first lady. He said that no internal review had been commenced in the wake of the Time report, saying `` I do n't know that there needs to be one.'' The Time magazine article included pictures of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> posing with, among others, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, and wearing expensive gowns. The article said she borrowed gowns ranging in value to as high as $ 22,000 for one such outfit. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokeswoman denied that the first lady had kept any of the numerous dresses and outfits loaned to her by designers. `` To a typical woman, there are some gowns that are so spectacular that you would only wear it once,'' she said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> designer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has borrowed 60 to 80 made-to-order outfits during the past eight years. She returned more than half and kept the others, he was quoted as saying in the Time article. `` We think of it as loans. It's wonderful,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` She has been a sensation for my business.'' An unidentified executive at <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> jewelers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> told Time that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> continued to borrow expensive accessories, including a pair of diamond earrings worth $ 800,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said the first lady on two occasions borrowed jewelry from <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> jewelers _ for the 1981 presidential inaugural and for the wedding of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> later that year. But the spokeswoman placed no value on the merchandise. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazakis </PERSON>, who worked with designer <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON> and is writing a book about the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, said he has identified more than 300 photographs since 1982 showing Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wearing outfits he estimates are worth a total of more than $ 1 million retail. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidential salary is $ 200,000 a year, and his 1987 tax form disclosed modest income that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had received in talent fees and residuals from appearances on network television shows, but no information about her clothing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s athletic director should apologize to a female reporter who was denied access to athletes after a football game, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> said Monday.

But the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> official said <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> had not apologized, adding, `` Until that is forthcoming, this incident can not be considered closed.'' <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> to seek an apology for Ms. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> from <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and any other university official involved in the incident, and to devise a rule to guarantee equal access to all reporters covering sports in the future.

 A foot-long crack and 29 smaller cracks were discovered by chance on a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 recently in roughly the same area where a similar <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet broke apart in flight last April, officials said Monday. Metallurgists from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> were examining the 30-inch section of the aircraft where the cracks were found along a `` lap joint,'' or section where the outer metal skin overlaps, near a window of the first-class section. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said the `` chilling discovery'' was made by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> workers Oct. 5 when they began stripping paint from the 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 to prepare it for repainting. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> in a speech delivered to an aviation group in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> called the discovery `` frightening'' in part because the cracks were found by chance and because they were `` in the same general area'' where the Aloha plane broke apart. But <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials cautioned against comparing the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident and the cracks found on the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> plane. One <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be further identified, said the cracks on the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> jet were found at a point lower on the aircraft near a window and where there apparently had been repair work performed by a previous owner of the plane. The <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident, which remains under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, is widely believed to involved cracking caused by corrosion, but corrosion does not appear to have been a factor in the cracks on the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> aircraft, this official suggested. An <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON>, said the agency expects to issue a new directive soon to airlines broadening the inspection requirements on older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s in search of cracks including increased use of testing by high-frequency electronic equipment. The new rule also will require that the planes be stripped of paint when being inspected, he said. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said the airline inspected all 42 of its older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s within 72 hours after the foot-long crack was discovered when the plane was being prepared for repainting at the airline's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> repair facility. He said no cracks were found in any of the other planes. `` This appears to be an isolated incident,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the plane, which was built in 1969, had undergone a visual inspection for cracks last May 20 in accordance with a directive from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and no cracks were found then. According to the safety board, the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> plane had about 55,446 takeoffs and landings. This was considerably fewer than the 89,000 cycles attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 involved in last April's incident in which a 20-foot section of the plane's roof ripped away during flight. A flight attendant was swept to her death, but the plane miraculously landed safely with passengers and flight attendants clinging to their seats to keep from being sucked through the gaping hole. The Aloha 737 was the 152nd off the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> assembly line, while the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> jet was No. 17O. Both were built in 1969 and were among the 291 737s on which a so-called `` cold bonding'' process was used to fix sections of metal sheets onto the fuselage. Shortly after the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> required airlines to conduct special inspections of more than 200 older 737s. Those aircraft with more than 30,000 takeoffs and landings were required to be visually inspected for cracks, while those with more than 50,000 takeoffs and landings were to undergo inspections with high-frequency electronic equipment. The so-called `` eddy current'' tests are designed to uncover extremely tiny cracks that might be overlooked in a visual inspection. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> plane where the foot-long crack was found Oct. 5 had more than 50,000 cycles the eddy current inspection was not required on the section of the aircraft where the crack later was discovered, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. He said a visual inspection of that section of the plane showed no cracking last May. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 is widely used for short-haul flights. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 212 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s operated by 19 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines in domestic service were subject to the special <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection requirements last May. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> the company was referring any questions to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> regarding the discovery of cracks.

<HEAD>Bakkers' Attorney Says Salaries and Benefits Were Legal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRIP DuBARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The salaries and benefits given <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founders <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> were properly approved and legal, the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' lawyer told a judge Monday in the trial of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 52 million lawsuit against the couple and a former aide. In his opening statement, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said the case against the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> boiled down to allegations they mismanaged the ministry, which went into bankruptcy three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in a sex-and-hush money scandal. <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said he would show that the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' salaries were authorized by the ministry's board, the benefits they enjoyed were properly donated by the ministry and the cash advances they received were reimbursed. But because the ministry's records are now dispersed among other legal actions, including bankruptcy court, <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said he may be unable to provide precise documentation. `` A lot of the records are simply not available,'' he told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. Instead, <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said, he would show a `` pattern of reimbursement'' and prior approval. <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>' comments marked the start of the second half of testimony in the lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and former aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorneys <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leggett </PERSON> entered into evidence financial records from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s time as leader of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and brought in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials and an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent to testify on behalf of its claims of mismanagement. Among the items admitted as evidence were receipts for extravagant purchases by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>, including installing a water slide at their lakefront home. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> also presented <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> documents that the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> received compensation and bonuses far in excess of accepted <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> guidelines. On Monday, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who said he has done financial consulting work for hundreds of churches including <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, testified that standard financial procedures for businesses were not the norm for churches, which found needs first and then sought the revenues to pay for them. `` Is it fair to say that financial matters of the church are dealt with on faith?'' <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> asked. `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> replied. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> sought protection in June 1987 under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, which shields an operation from creditors while it reorganizes. On Monday, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who is overseeing the bankruptcy case, said he wants to see how the proposed sale of the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> complex shapes up before considering whether to liquidate <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> postponed until Nov. 16 consideration of several motions by creditors to move the ministry from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7. If granted, it would mean the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> entertainment park and other ministry assets such as satellite television facilities, a hotel and real estate would be sold by an immediate auction rather than by an arranged sale. Canadian businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has signed a contract with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> for $ 115 million, and Nov. 16 is the date <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> is to present the proposed sale to the court. `` As you'll observe, I'm stacking everything up to the 16th, to see what washes out by then,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said the ministry's payroll has continued to shrink, with about 150 people laid off since Labor Day, including about 100 seasonal and temporary employees. The trustee said the ministry's labor force was down to about 400 people evenly divided between the for-profit debtor corporation holding the ministry's assets, and the non-profit ministry. The ministry had about 1,480 full-time employees at the time it filed for bankruptcy protection.

 Lawmakers complained Monday that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> settled for too little in a pact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases and warned the terms could boost those who want the facilities closed when the lease expires. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> urged the public to wait for more details before judging the new agreement, which was signed Monday afternoon in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>. The pact sets the terms for the remaining two years of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lease on the bases, which expires in 1991. Under the terms, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will get $ 962 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in exchange for use of the bases. The negotiations were technically a review of an existing bases agreement that the Aquino government never hinted at canceling. But tension between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its former colony were high because of bargaining over the aid package as well as nuclear and other issues. Opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said Monday the upper chamber should have the chance to ratify the agreement as if it were a treaty because `` there are rights and obligations growing from it.'' He cited a constitutional provision which says no treaty or international agreement shall be valid without the concurrence of two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Aquino administration has not indicated that the agreement needs <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the accord showed that `` it seems this administration is not ready yet to stand up to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` A publicly unacceptable compensation package certainly strengthens the hands of those who are batting for no extension -LRB- of the bases lease -RRB- after 1991,'' <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> said. Philippine sources have said that <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, head of the Philippine negotiating panel, originally asked for $ 1.2 billion a year for use of the two largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases abroad _ the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Base _ and four smaller installations. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refused to comment on the agreement, saying only: `` Why do n't we just wait until all the details are laid out and expressed by Secretary <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>.'' She has not said whether she will support extending the agreement after 1991, one year before her term ends. The Constitution requires that any extension be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where anti-bases sentiment is strong. Rep. <PERSON> Gualberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumauig </PERSON> of the lower chamber's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, termed the agreement `` welcome news'' because it would mean more money for the country's debt-strapped economy. The agreement represents an increase of $ 258 million in economic and military aid as part of a complicated arrangement that permits the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to use a `` substantial portion'' to reduce its debt and bars <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers who test positive for AIDS from serving in the country. But Sen. <PERSON> Wigberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON>, a leading opponent of the bases and chief sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-nuclear weapons bill, said financial compensation was not the only issue. `` I do n't think it is enough to settle the issue of compensation if the threat of national destruction due to nuclear weapons and the derogation of national sovereignty is still there,'' he said. Left-wing groups pressing for the dismantling of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities branded the agreement a `` sell-out'' and said <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> should not have linked continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence here to the debt issue.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief urged <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> on Monday to unite behind reform or face destruction, but a defiant <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leader defended the mass rallies that are fueling ethnic unrest. Worker dissatisfaction over the economy together with ethnic discontent have stirred speculation recently about a possible military takeover or an eventual break-up of the six republics and two autonomous provinces that make up <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Defense Minister Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Veljko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadijevic </PERSON> said, however, it was `` false and malicious'' to suggest the army `` should take power through a putsch.'' The crisis is <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s gravest since World War II. A key meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opened Monday with party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> urging quarreling leaders to unite behind reform. `` All of us in this country are faced with a choice _ either we all resolve the crisis together, or we all head to destruction,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> warned in a two-hour speech. But Serbian party chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, hailed by supporters as `` the second Tito,'' a reference to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s longtime late leader, responded with a stinging attack on past inability to control the country's worst postwar economic and social crises. Yugoslavs will not accept another `` marathon, sclerotic session'' that does nothing to ease ethnic tension and economic hardship, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> told the closed-door session in a speech later broadcast on national radio and television. Workers battling a 217 percent inflation rate and austerity measures imposed to curb a $ 21 billion foreign debt have increasingly blamed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders for their plight, and have protested on the streets. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> defended his drive to extend Serbian control over its two autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where the Serb minority alleges harassment at the hands of the ethnic Albanian majority. Hundreds of thousands of Serbs have been rallying to back <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s demands, causing unprecedented rifts with communist leaders of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s five other republics. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> demanded an end to `` reckless confrontations'' and said the mass rallies `` are leading us nowhere.'' But <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> said: `` Any banning of the meetings is unacceptable,'' and said claims that the rallies fuel unrest are `` sad and shameful.'' The non-Serbs fear <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> seeks to boost his national power and that of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> assured them, `` <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> has no claims to the territory of other republics. It does have claim to territory in its own republic.'' <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> are historically part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. His speech indicated that rifts that opened up in clashes last week with <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> and party chief <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> of liberal, northern <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> still divide <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s three most important Communist leaders. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, a Croat, advocated `` a fundamental renewal of socialism'' and urgent economic and political reforms to solve mounting foreign debt and stagnation. <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> later expressed unreserved support for <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s speech. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> made plain he wants the problem of control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> sorted out before economic reform goes ahead. The meeting was billed as a historic gathering to shake up the party leadership. `` All the incompetent and compromised people must go, and this society must be ensured of a perspective,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said Monday. But no immediate word surfaced on any sweeping personnel changes. <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, the top ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> leader from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, rejected <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> calls to step down. To date, four members of the 23-man Politburo have said they will resign. Their resignations are expected to be formally accepted by the 162-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said last week up to one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> could be replaced. Few leaders who spoke Monday offered any new suggestions to solve <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s woes. <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> however advanced the novel idea of a referendum to test the party's popularity in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and denied that the republic's liberal leadership has no popular support The party chief of the republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marko </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlandic </PERSON>, attacked the federal government of Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> and blamed it for for failing to solve the economic crisis. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> advocated expanded private ownership, increased foreign investment and the shutdown of unprofitable state enterprises. He said key managerial positions limited to communists might be opened to non-party members. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> also said a new constitution might be drafted and discussed at the next national party congress in 1990. The constitution, adopted in 1974 under <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, created a loose confederation. Many see it as a main cause of the problems now because it leaves central power weak.

<HEAD>U.N. Officials Say U.S. Still Will Withhold Some Dues</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue withholding some of its dues to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> despite President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pledge last month that they would be paid, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would retain $ 59 million in dues to force the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to adopt an austerity budget. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said the withholding of funds will endanger <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping projects, such as military observers in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and possible future missions to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and other areas. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 13 that he would release the $ 188 million in dues owed for last year and this year and added he was satisfied with the organization's progress on budgetary and administrative reforms. The $ 188 million is $ 44 million from the previous fiscal year and $ 144 million for the current fiscal year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> paid $ 15 million in September and on Friday it gave the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> $ 85.6 million. That still leaves more than $ $ 87 million from the $ 188 million owed. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said the full amount would be paid by the end of the year. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> informed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that $ 59 million would be frozen until the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s main financial committee, the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, adopts an austerity budget recommended last month by a subcommittee. Even if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays all $ 188 million it will still owe millions more to the world organization in funds withheld during earlier years. Friday's payment reduced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrears to the regular budget to $ 366.3 million. And <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> owes about $ 300 million more for unpaid assessments for other projects including peacekeeping forces and payments to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special agencies. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last month pledged a `` multi-year'' payment plan for all the back dues. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> has said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told him the payments would be on a three-to-five-year plan. Since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office nearly eight years ago his administration has harshly criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nation </LOCATION>, accusing it of having an anti-Western bias and of bureaucracy and waste. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed one-fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s regular budget, and was supposed to pay $ 212 million this fiscal year but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> only appropriated $ 144 million. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said that continued withholding of funds could force the world body to close in November. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has no reserve funds and operates by spending dues it collects almost as soon as it receives them. <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said so far the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has collected only a fraction of the $ 35.7 million it assessed its members for the first three month of operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials are discussing possibly installing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific instruments on a Soviet spacecraft as part of a joint superpower project to monitor damage to the Earth's ozone layer, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Monday.

<HEAD>Lawyers React Cautiously To Proposed Changes In Libel Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Libel lawyers reacted cautiously Monday to a proposal for sweeping changes in libel law, predicting it could lead to many frivolous suits and saying they doubted such a plan would be politically appealing. The proposal is designed to resolve disputes quickly with a focus on deciding the truth of disputed statements, rather than on the awarding of damages. The centerpiece of the proposal is the `` no fault'' trial where no damages would be awarded, only court fees paid by the loser. While the media would get relief from the prospect of huge damage awards, they also would give up protections that have restricted libel rulings. Although many libel lawyers and media representatives were reluctant to embrace the proposal in its entirety, they said they were encouraged that a panel of 11 lawyers, judges, journalists and others of diverse backgrounds and philosophies could find consensus on the thorny issue of libel. `` There are a lot of aspects the media side would find favorable, and I'm impressed that they could bring together both sides and get them to agree'' on a package of proposed reforms, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> libel lawyer who also is general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Libel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` But this does n't break totally new ground. Some of these proposals have been aired before ... and we know what the reactions are likely to be,'' he said. `` On both sides there would be some serious reservations.'' The study panel was put together by the <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, Ill. The panel's proposal breaks libel action into three stages. In the first, the emphasis is on retraction and replies. If a newspaper or broadcast station agrees to print or air a retraction or a reply by the person complaining about news coverage of them, then the case is settled and a lawsuit can not be filed. If there is no retraction or reply, either side can demand that a lawsuit be tried for `` declaratory judgment,'' with the loser paying the legal costs of the winner. Such trials would have to begin within 120 days. The only issue would be the truth _ regardless of intent or negligence _ and no damages would be awarded. If neither side wants a declaratory judgment, then a lawsuit for libel would proceed along a path similar to the current one, except that damages would be limited to the plaintiff's actual loss _ punitive damages would not be awarded. Also, no one could sue over statements of opinion, such as an editorial cartoon. Only facts would be considered, and at this stage, each side would have to pay their own legal fees. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Libel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the media in libel cases, does not take positions on such matters. But, speaking as a libel lawyer, he said neither libel plaintiffs nor the media are likely to work aggressively to push such a proposal through. `` I have no reason to think plaintiffs' lawyers would be supportive of something that removes from them the possibility of a pot of gold at the end of the libel rainbow,'' he said. The media's reluctance revolves around the proposed change that would eliminate the requirement that public figures suing for libel prove that defamatory statements about them were published with `` actual malice,'' meaning with the knowledge that they were false, or with `` reckless disregard'' of whether they were false. `` If I were a publisher, I would n't willingly trade constitutional protections for the illusion of some kind of an expedited low-cost, dispute-resolution process,'' said libel lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> with the firm <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` I would n't give up constitutional protections lightly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> declined to embrace the proposal, but said `` It deserves careful review.'' In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedheim </PERSON> said, `` The search for the best way to resolve disputes between the news media and people who believe they have been wronged in news coverage is well worth continuing.'' Attorney <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a noted constitutional lawyer, said that while he would like to see libel reforms, any proposal as sweeping as the <LOCATION> Annenberg </LOCATION> one should be tested in a small area before it is put into practice on a large scale. `` The main danger of the proposal is that it could lead to an explosion of new libel litigation in which people seek declarations that something that was said about them was not true,'' he said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> also was skeptical about the chances for getting such a proposal implemented. `` I think it will probably take some new disastrous libel case before we have any major structural change, some enormous verdict in some highly publicized case,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> on Monday criticized the South African government for `` consistent and arbitrary'' censorship of the press in that country.

The fog, a possible `` misunderstanding'' between pilot and control tower at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da <LOCATION> Vinci </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and lack of sophisticated equipment on a seldom-used runway were cited as suspected factors in the crash. All 21 survivors were hospitalized, many in critical condition with burns, fractures and shock. Only one of seven crew members, a steward, survived. Wreckage was strewn for half a mile, but only one injury was reported on the ground. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> police headquarters spokesman <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moscarelli </PERSON> said late Monday that one passenger died in a hospital, raising the death toll to 31. Among survivors was British dairy farmer <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gait </PERSON>, who said he and his wife <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, who was holding their 8-month-old son, jumped from the wreckage right before it went up in flames. The family suffered slight burns. The jet missed the runway by several hundred yards. It tore through a wooden house, clipped a garage, demolished a brick house under construction and plowed through the parking lot of a car rental agency, where an engine and a wing tore off and a fire destroyed 75 cars, according to authorities. An occupant of the wooden house, <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Satta </PERSON>, 30, was hit on the nose by a beam as he slept in bed in <LOCATION> Fiumicino </LOCATION>, 21 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Flight No. 775 began at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> late Sunday and was bound for <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, with a one-hour stopover scheduled in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Most of those aboard were Ugandans. The British Embassy in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said the passenger list included seven or eight British citizens. Two Nigerians were listed among the injured. Airport authorities said Monday evening they did not have a list of the dead by name and nationality. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said the jet tried to land three times at the seaside airport before it crashed. Passenger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harigye </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Ugandan </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, told reporters from his hospital bed that a flight attendant told him just before the crash that the plane tried once to land, had to circle because of the fog, and was about to try another landing. He said that next came a violent collision and he found himself upside down in his seat, held by his seatbelt. `` I realized one side of the plane was gone. I pushed through a hole,'' helping a family friend seated near him to leave the plane, he said. Outside the jet, `` I saw a woman who was calling me. She knew me. I told her to move away,'' then the plane exploded, said <PERSON> Harigye </PERSON>, whose hand bandage was soaked with blood. The fuel apparently ignited after the crash. <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiucini </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Province's fire department, speculated in a telephone interview that a `` misunderstanding'' may have developed between the control tower and the pilot since the landing was begun at a very low altitude. <PERSON> Chiucini </PERSON>, who helped coordinate the rescue, did not elaborate. Later the air traffic controllers' union denied there was a misunderstanding. Asked about <PERSON> Chiucini </PERSON>'s remarks, <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> said the tapes of cockpit conversation had yet to be reviewed. Since Sunday evening, a heavy fog had enveloped the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> seacoast including the airport. `` The fog appears to have been the main culprit,'' Di <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> said. Without citing its sources, RAI state television said the pilot began the third attempt too low. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the pilot had approached from three different directions because of shifting fog banks. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Gariup </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s main pilots' union, was quoted by RAI as saying the runway on which the pilot tried to land lacked sophisticated equipment to help in instrument landings and was not normally used. Authorities reported both the flight instrument data recordings and the recordings of conversations between cockpit and tower were recovered. <PERSON> Gait </PERSON> said he was involved in a charity project to provide <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> farmers with cows. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at <ORGANIZATION> Sant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ` </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eugenio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> that he heard the planes' wheels come up, go down and then go up again moments before `` The flames came through the cabin, my wife says. I do n't remember ... We jumped out of a hole in the fuselage behind us.. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> jumped backward, holding -LRB- baby <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> -RRB- to her chest and then fell about six feet to the ground I picked them up. We walked about 200 yards and then some Ugandans came out.'' The three Gaits were expected to be discharged by Wednesday.

<HEAD>Official: Passengers On More Than 120 Flights May Be Affected</HEAD>

 A bacterial illness linked to food served on at least eight <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flights since Sept. 15 may ultimately affect passengers on more than 120 Northwest flights, a state official said Monday. `` We have received hundreds of calls as this has hit the national media,'' state epidemiologist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said at a news conference. Some complaints have come from as far as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which are on <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s flight routes, he said. Confirmed cases of the illness, shigellosis, have been found among passengers who flew with the airline as late as Oct. 12. <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said it's not clear if food now being served on Northwest planes is safe. `` I ca n't confirm that it is safe and I ca n't say it is n't,'' he said. The disease causes intense diarrhea and other symptoms that can last for five to seven days. It spreads easily from person to person. Of people exposed to the bacteria, about 10 percent usually get sick, <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said. All the illnesses confirmed so far have been traced to food prepared in <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s airline kitchen at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport The facility serves 100,000 meals a week for Northwest. The investigation began after 21 <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> became ill after eating food prepared for a flight to an Oct. 2 football game in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Investigators initially focused on the possibility that ingredients in the meals may have been contaminated or that one or more sick food preparers transmitted the bacteria, and <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> say the latter now appears more likely. Shigellosis has been confirmed in passengers on eight flights from the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Two flight attendants are among those confirmed as having been infected. <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said it's probable that `` several hundred'' passengers on more than 120 additional flights may have been affected. The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has set up extra telephone lines to receive calls from people who believe they may have been infected. `` We're working around the clock here _ literally,'' <PERSON> Osterholm </PERSON> said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, stalking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats on the Texas-Arkansas border, scoffed Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> charges that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors harsh gun controls and would weaken the military. `` I saw those ads about <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> going to take the guns away from you, confiscate the guns, not even pay for them.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told 200 supporters at an airport rally during a refueling stop on his way to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Let me tell you, a fella like <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> likes to go quail hunting like I do,'' said the Democratic vice presidential candidate. `` -LRB- I -RRB- sure would n't be running with any fella if I thought he was going to take my shotgun away from me, no way.'' While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does support gun control, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, he believes sportsmen should have guns and people have the right to defend their homes. He said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` the only one of the four candidate who has voted for national gun control'' as a congressman in 1968. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said it was untrue that the Democrats wanted to cut defense spending. He scorned Republican commercials on the defense issue featuring former test pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON> should return to writing books and lobbying for a defense contractor, and stay out of politics. Later in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a crowd of several thousand students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> that the Republicans were squandering <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s technological future. In 1980, he said, 60 percent of color televisions sold in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Today, less than 10 percent are, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes no video cassette recorders, compact disc players or fax machines. He also decried what he said were Republican distortions of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record, invoking, as he did over the weekend, the image of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s come-from-behind campaign. `` It was <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> who said that you have to appeal to the best instincts of people, not to their worst,'' he told the crowd, few of whom were born when <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was in the White House. `` Sometimes you can win a few elections that way, but you really hurt your country.'' `` Well, some of you recall when <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> ran for re-election, he had a very arrogant opponent that knew he'd won it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said referring to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. `` But the people kept yelling to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, ` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, give ` em hell.' But <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> would say, ` I just tell the truth and the Republicans think it's hell.' `` Well, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are offering the truth,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION> stopover was aimed at both East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, which are strong in loyal Democrats but where the party has been struggling to reverse its sagging fortunes in the Bush-Dukakis presidential race. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has refused to concede <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, although the Democratic ticket is more than 10 points behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in some polls. The contest is closer in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> but the Democrats have suffered there. Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., said last week that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` not welcome'' in his district Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., rode to <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on the campaign jet and told reporters that his state was still there for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win if he improves his organization and his message <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said favorite Dukakis-Bentsen topics such as world trade are too esoteric for many <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> voters. So far, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has proved to be a disappointing campaigner who is unwilling to exploit issues where Republicans are vulnerable, such as the war on drugs. `` He's got to show some passion, commitment, leadership,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. `` He may have made an A-plus in political science, but so far he has n't passed politics.'' `` He could capture the hearts and minds of the people of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in the next three weeks if he'd come out swinging,'' he said. `` He can do it. ... Someone's got ta get him off in the corner, grab him and tell him what to do.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, signaling he wo n't sit on his lead in the campaign's final weeks, returned to the attack Monday and said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should `` stop running down our defenses.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with ignoring the nation's loss of industrial jobs. Battling the notion that he is slipping hopelessly behind, the Democratic presidential nominee stopped at a factory, a diner and a bowling alley as he began a campaing swing through industrial states. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` sat on his hands while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland has been fighting for its life.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was confronted with an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has opened a huge lead, 55 percent to 38 percent, nationally since their final debate last Thursday. `` Well I can only tell you that there are other polls that say very different things about where we are and where the race is,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told an interviewer for a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> television station. `` Now, we've got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no relationship to anything that we have or other polls have, so you spend two or three days'' answering answering questions about it, he said. The poll was conducted Friday trough Sunday among 1,378 likely voters, and found even half of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own supporters expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> launched an attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the South as `` the only one of the four candidates who has voted for national gun control.'' He referred to a 1968 vote while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. With three weeks left in the presidential race, aides to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would seek to sharpen the differences between himself and the vice president, particularly on economic issues. But as he arrived in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a big state crucial to his chances, a new statewide poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holding a double-digit lead. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, buoyant but cautioning against overconfidence, toured a Denver-area defense plant where Star Wars research is conducted. He then spoke at the dedication of a Holocaust memorial in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, where he said `` the relationship between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never been better.'' He used the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> setting to say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a `` total lack of understanding of our military'' and is `` trying desperately to jump into the mainstream'' by acknowledging a need to modernize land-based nuclear missiles. `` But there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He still opposes the MX and he thinks the Midgetman costs too much. So he says he's going to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to find another way. `` Wake up governor,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` we've done all that.'' He defended the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's record on conventional forces against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' past charges that such forces have been slighted in the push for new, big-ticket strategic weapons systems. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed that as `` misinformation.'' `` Governor, it's time to stop running down our defenses,'' he said. He also ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for supporting some research into Star Wars while dismissing the proposed space-based missile-defense system as a fantasy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his campaign staff were embracing the idea of running as the underdog. To underscore his resolve, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` My spirits are good'' and took trumpet in hand to play `` Happy Days Are Here Again,'' a Democratic standard. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared he was `` fighting for the values I believe in,'' and, in a touch of populism, told workers at a copper and brass plant, `` I want to be the president who stands up and fights for you.'' He pointed to recent trade figures showing imports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were at an all-time high in August and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has not given the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people a clue as to what he would do'' to reverse the trade deficit. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sat on the sidelines for eight years while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> got beaten in world markets, ... while a piece of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was being sold off every day at bargain-basement prices,'' he said. He also disputed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s standard speech line that he wants `` a kinder gentler nation.'' `` His record tells rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the fewer family farmers the better. His record tells middle class families, the glory days are over. Your kids may not do as well as you,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, trying to save some of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> for the Democrats, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not planning cuts in defense spending and defended him against television ads playing in the South that hit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an advocate of gun control. `` I sure would n't be running with any fellow if I thought he was going to take my shotgun away from me,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, on the Texas-Arkansas border. Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dropped in unannounced at a <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, Burger King restaurant, where he talked about sports and wood-burning stoves over coffee with customers. He also took a page from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign book by pledging `` good jobs at good wages'' _ the phrase <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has used since the primaries. In a series of stops across <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where the auto industry has been hard hit by foreign competition, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called for `` fair, free trade'' without resorting to `` protectionist barriers.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> executive board Monday after a poll of the nation's largest union gave him a four-point margin over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, union officials said. Just 21,207 members of the 1.7 million-strong <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> voted in the poll, said union president <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and has been critical of the governor. The union has not endorsed a Democrat for president since 1968 but had a falling out with the Republican <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1986 over the indictment of union president <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. The union would endorse neither <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, however. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, meanwhile has begun a new television ad saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be more qualified to negotiate with Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` This is not time to train somebody in how to meet with the Russians,'' the ad says. `` This is the time for somebody who's ready on day one to be president.'' The 30-second ad began running over the weekend.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Monday that if he is elected prime minister in Nov. 1 elections, Palestinians in the occupied territories will elect delegates to peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> spoke on a day when 16 Palestinians were reported shot in clashes with troops in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Monday, two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were wounded, one seriously, apparently from a Palestinian firebomb attack, an army spokesman said. He said the circumstances of the incident in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Azzun </LOCATION> were unclear and still under investigation. A home-made bomb was thrown on Monday at police guarding the home of former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> in the Moslem sector of the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, police said. They said no injury or damage resulted and that the attacker escaped despite police gunfire. It was the second unsuccessful attack on the house in less than a month. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, now industry minister, was away, on a private visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said balloting in the territories would be held only if calm is restored. `` If the violence is restrained, we will hold free elections in <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> so that a Palestinian ... delegation can be elected to represent the Palestinian side in negotiations,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said, using the biblical names for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The suggestion was rejected by several <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders, including Israeli-deposed <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Natsche </PERSON>. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that before any elections, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must recognize our right to self-determination and our right to choose our own representatives.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, whose hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc is Labor's main opponent, said `` nothing will remain'' of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters if they carry out threats to use weapons against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes giving back any of the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Labor favors trading some land for peace. Polls say the two major parties are in a close race. Much of the campaigning has centered on the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, which has claimed the lives of 299 Arabs and six Israelis since Dec. 8. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member who joined <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> at a news conference to announce the peace talk election proposal, said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives must be chosen `` from residents of the territories, by residents of the territories.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said any resident of the territories could run in the elections. But he said at least three months of calm would have to precede the balloting.

Among the casualties Monday were four Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> area, including a 13-year-old boy who was shot in the back after youths hurled rocks at troops, an Arab reporter said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops shot eight youths with plastic bullets and wounded four with live ammunition during stone-throwing clashes in four Palestinian refugee camps, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. One of the wounded was a 13-year-old boy hit in the eye with a plastic bullet, the officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted an army medical officer as saying 575 soldiers and 321 Israeli civilians have been injured in the uprising. Most were hit by stones. Israeli officials have said more than 7,000 Palestinians have been injured in the revolt.

 A federal grand jury indicted Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> on perjury charges Monday, accusing the two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman of lying during a money laundering investigation. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, locked in what has been called one of the country's dirtiest congressional re-election battles, pleaded innocent to all counts during an afternoon arraignment and was free on his own recognizance He said he hoped to bring the case to trial next Monday in order to clear his name by the Nov. 8 general election. `` When I am exonerated, obviously the only issue that remains is whether the 4th District wants a Dukakis liberal or a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conservative,'' he told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he would resign if he were convicted of the charges, even though not required to by law. He said he expects to serve a jail term if found guilty. He said he would step down `` because under the circumstances, I do n't think it would be fair to the voters of the 4th District'' to remain in office. His Democratic opponent, former `` Dukes of Hazzard'' television actor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, commented, `` I feel concern for the congressman and for his family at this point. ... It is a matter for the courts to decide.'' The 10-count indictment accused <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> of lying to the grand jury last Feb. 2 during its investigation of a proposed $ 850,000 home mortgage loan the congressman had discussed with an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman and an undercover agent posing as a financier. Among other things, the indictment charged that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied when he told the grand jury he did not go to authorities to report the loan negotiations, because, he said, `` I never satisfied myself of anything with respect to criminality.'' The indictment also charged <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied when he said there had never been discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the money, and that he lied when he denied having been specifically informed by the undercover agent that the source of the loan could be illicit drug money. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said that if convicted, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $ 10,000 on each count. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who had been notified of the pending indictment in advance, announced Sunday night that he expected to be indicted and said he was excited by the prospect because it would give him a chance to clear his name. He said he would waive a number of rights, including the right to charge the government with misconduct, so the case could go to trial next Monday. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he would act as his own attorney. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> entered his innocent plea before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, who then assigned the case to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> had previously been scheduled to try <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and a second person accused of money laundering next Monday. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said there were indications <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and the second man might step aside and allow <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s case to be tried ahead of their cases. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in 1986, this year has made an issue of <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' arrest record, including a conviction for assaulting his wife. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has said the incidents occurred during a bout with alcoholism that ended in 1977. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who starred as `` Cooter'' in the long-running television series, `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' once suggested that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> submit to drug tests, insinuating the congressman's behavior was unstable. The indictment stems from negotiations <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> undertook last year with LeChasney to finance a mortgage loan for his $ 1.2 million home. LeChasney, who has since been indicted on money-laundering charges, introduced <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a money broker. In June, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspapers obtained several secretly made government tape recordings of conversations among <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and the undercover agent. The tapes showed that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> continued to pursue negotiations for an $ 850,000 loan after being told that the source might be drug money he would be helping to launder. He accepted a $ 150,000 check as the first installment on the loan, but returned it uncashed three days later, saying he was suspicious of LeChasney's business dealings. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has since apologized for his role in the negotiations, calling it a mistake in judgment but insisting there was no wrongdoing.

 Leaders of the Teamsters, the nation's largest union, voted Monday to back <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president, breaking with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> However, union President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> emphasized that the endorsement applied only to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally, not his running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, nor the Republican party. The action came after only 21,207 of the union's 1.7 million members returned mail-in presidential ballots giving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 50.2 percent to 46.4 percent margin over his Democratic rival, said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. He said the union would have backed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if the membership poll had gone the other way, but he applauded the decision to back <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We feel he is more qualified and can do a greater job for this country,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said after the union's 18-member board of directors ratified the membership vote during a meeting at the Grenelefe Resort. `` We feel we can get a fair shake from him.'' Reacting to the snub while campaigning in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` The important thing is that they endorsed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and that's good news for me.'' `` It's going to be important to have their votes,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The union president insisted that the poll was fair despite the small number of voters, saying all members had the opportunity to register their opinions. The Teamsters have not backed a Democrat for president since Vice President <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in 1968. But when the union rejoined the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> a year ago following a 30-year absence, officials for both had anticipated the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> would go along with the federation's expected endorsement of the Democratic nominee. The deal apparently fell through when <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> took over the union following the death of <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> announced its endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in August, and the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> were one of three unions that abstained while 88 unions supported it, 87 of them unanimously. Teamster officials said then they expected the union to make no endorsement, a stand the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> last took in 1976 when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> defeated incumbent President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> before taking over the union, had crossed swords with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, backing his electoral opponents there. But he denied Monday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsement was intended to spite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I have no opinion of him,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said of the governor. Union spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said the vote indicated <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> are satisfied with the economy because they `` are concerned with such bread-and-butter issues as jobs.'' The Teamsters endorsed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984, but the union had a falling out with the administration in 1986 over <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s indictment. When he died in July after a long bout with cancer and heart disease, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was under indictment in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> for allegedly hiring ghost employees for the union. The union is also the target of a federal civil racketeering suit that was filed June 28. That suit seeks to have <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> officials who violated racketeering laws removed from office and replaced with a trustee.

<HEAD>Fan Failure Causes Evacuation Of 100 At Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A malfunctioning fan in a plutonium-processing area caused the evacuation of about 100 employees at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Plant Monday, but officials said there was no contamination of the workers or the atmosphere. The fan broke down at 2:46 p.m., and was restarted about 30 minutes later, said plant spokesman <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. The cause of the equipment failure was under investigation. The exhaust fan is used to pull fresh air from the outside through the building and out to filters that trap any radioactive material. The air flow serves to remove any releases of contamination from the building. But a fan failure could produce a reverse air flow, which could allow contamination to accumulate in the building or be forced outside. The amount of contamination would depend on how much plutonium was being processed when such an accident occurred. Officials will not discuss specifics on plutonium production. A backup fan normally would have been activated, but the second unit was out of service for routine maintenance, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, about 700 employees elsewhere in <LOCATION> F-Area </LOCATION>, where plutonium is refined for use in nuclear weapons, were detained about an hour while an inventory of nuclear materials was completed. Such inventories are routinely conducted, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said.

 A national poll Monday said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a 17-point lead in the presidential race, garnering 55 percent support among likely voters compared with 38 percent for Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll was his greatest of the campaign and considerably greater than in surveys earlier this month. It was the first full-sized poll conducted after last week's debate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by 10 points in smaller, overnight polls done immediately after Thursday's debate, but they were conducted only among debate viewers, a more Republican group. He led by five or six points in most pre-debate polls. In the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll, conducted Friday through Sunday among 1,378 likely voters, almost three-quarters said they expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win the election, including half of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own supporters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> disputed the figures, as did running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Now we've got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no relationship to anything that we have or other polls have, so you spend two or three days'' answering answering questions about it, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` If there has been an increase in the gap it may be attributable to some of the stories about the debate,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it's accurate,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` You see wide fluctuations among those polls. That's what's happening.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign received two blows last week: A 50-state poll by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had an overwhelming lead in the race for electoral votes, and polls said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was seen as the debate winner. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favorably rated by 55 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll, up from 50 percent a month ago. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' favorability rating dropped to 36 percent, down from 50 percent a month ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advantage was chiefly among men: They backed him by a 2-1 margin, 64-30, while the race among women was a nearly even 48-44. A gender gap has been apparent, to varying degrees, throughout the campaign. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points.

 A tropical storm off the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> coast reached hurricane force Monday with winds of more than 80 mph as the system gathered strength over open water, forecasters said. Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, the fifth hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season, was upgraded from tropical storm status Monday night and could intensify as it moves away from the Colombian coast and into the western <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, the National Hurricane Center reported. The storm's winds, which had dropped to 45 mph Sunday, rose to at least 80 mph in an area northwest of the center and 75 mph winds over most of the system, just above the minimum 74 mph hurricane level. At 9 p.m. EDT, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s center was near latitude 11.9 north and longitude 74.1 west, or just west of the <LOCATION> Guajira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and 520 miles east of the island of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and was expected to continue that motion through Tuesday. Four to 8 inches of rain is forecast along <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s path. `` It's a straight shot to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but it's not there yet. There is no threat for the next 60 hours or so,'' said center forecaster <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> became the 10th named system of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season Oct. 11 when top winds passed the minimum 39 mph mark to qualify for classification as a tropical storm. There have been four other hurricanes so far this season, including Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars in damage as it tore through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Yucatan peninsula.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reached for the common touch on Monday, visiting a metal factory, a diner and a bowling alley as he tried to reinvigorate a faltering presidential campaign. `` I want to be a president who stands up and fights for American companies, American products and American workers,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, depicting Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate of complacency. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor embraced the role of underdog as polls in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and elsewhere showed him losing ground since last week's presidential debate. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll reported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading 55 percent to 38 percent, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> disputed the fundings. `` Well I can only tell you that there are other polls that say very different things about where we are and where the race is,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told an interviewer for a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> television station. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a series of interviews, described the race as `` very tight'' and said, `` the business of polls is really having a terrible effect'' on the campaign process. `` Now we've got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no relationship to anything that we have or other polls have, so you spend two or three days'' answering answering questions about it. He declined to say what his internal campaign polling shows. The governor's day was designed to counter criticism that he has failed to connect emotionally with middle class voters, particularly those in the industrial states. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended his day more than 12 hours after he began at a rally in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> attended by blacks and he took a veiled shot at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Something is very wrong when a presidential candidate calls <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> a hero, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a hustler,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once used that term to describe <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a newspaper interview. His first stop was a brass and copper factory in <LOCATION> Euclid </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, where he toured the plant wearing a jacket that bore two pocket patches, one saying, `` Mike'' and the other `` Next President.'' Addressing workers at a factory-floor rally, he criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for opposing increases in the minimum wage and for advocating a trade policy that he said seemed like `` a re-run of Let's Make a Deal.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` sat on his hands while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland has been fighting for its life.'' Next was a brief visit to Shorty's diner in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, where he joined a patron and his daughter at a booth. `` Let's kick some ass out there,'' said the man, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> LaChina </PERSON>. `` OK, very good, we'll do it,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, he went to a bowling alley for a meeting with families, many of whom said they were worried about the threat of drugs and concerned about meeting the costs of higher education. In his factory speech, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assures the voters `` everything's fine, not to worry. ... `` But his record sends a very different message. ... His record tells <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland, ` Let it rust,''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told reporters, `` My spirits are good'' as he set out on a campaign swing through industrial states. And he twice took trumpet in hand to make a stab at a few bars of `` Happy Days Are Here Again.'' But the political news for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was anything but happy as newspaper polls in the wake of last week's presidential debate indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds a double-digit lead in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to return two or three times before Election Day to the state, one of several in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> that form the core of his hopes for a come-from-behind victory in the race for the White House. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has decided to campaign as the underdog he is for the final three weeks of the campaign, and in his new campaign speech, he said he is `` fighting for the values I believe in, the values that are at the core of this campaign.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` sat on his hands while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland has been fighting for its life'' and now wo n't be specific about what he would do as president. `` Take trade, for example. ... Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trade policy is like a re-run of ` Let's Make A Deal.' Letting the voters guess what's behind door No 1, door No. 2 and door No. 3,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sat on the sidelines for eight years while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> got beaten in world markets ... while a piece of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was being sold off every day at bargain-basement prices,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would work hard to create good jobs at good wages, adding, `` That's not just a slogan, that comes from the gut.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he believes in the dignity of work, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted. But he said the vice president opposed legislation mandating a 60-day notice to workers before their factory could be closed and voted for a budget plan that would have frozen Social Security cost-of-living increases. `` ... Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saw nothing, said nothing and did nothing while his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> used every trick in the book to keep the minimum wage a poverty wage,'' of $ 3.35 an hour, he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> taunted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-repeated declaration that he wants a `` kinder, gentler nation.'' `` His record tells rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the fewer family farmers the better.

 A man who barricaded himself in his apartment building shot and killed two police officers Monday before he was killed by police to end the nearly seven-hour siege, authorities said. Relatives said the gunman, identified as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, was distraught because he had been beaten and robbed Sunday night. Police spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, 50, had a history of mental instability. Police went to the three-story apartment building about 8 a.m. after receiving reports that <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> had threatened other tenants and was pouring gasoline inside the building, said <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> fired through the door of his apartment about 9:30 a.m., striking Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmit </PERSON> in the chest, <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schmit </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Samaritan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after surgery for a chest wound, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMon </PERSON> said. Negotiations with <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> continued while about 25 families in and near the apartment building were kept from their homes, <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON> said. `` Exhaustive attempts by police officers and members of the <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> family to talk him into surrendering were of no avail,'' the spokesman said. `` The decision to enter the dwelling was made after considering the fact that Mr. <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> had poured gasoline through the apartment building which may have been ignited as children were about to be dismissed from schools in the area.'' The police's Special Response Unit forced their way into <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>'s apartment about 2:05 p.m., <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> fired as they entered and struck Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walls </PERSON>, who died about 30 minutes later at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Other officers returned fire and killed <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> instantly, <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schmit </PERSON>, 41, was a 20-year veteran, and <PERSON> Walls </PERSON>, 39, was a 13-year veteran. The gunman's nephew, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, said his uncle was retired, lived alone and had been a victim of other crimes in recent months. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>'s apartment had been burglarized several months ago after police took him into custody, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said. The nephew said he did not know what offense was involved in that arrest but added that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> had bought a rifle afterward. `` The police came in today, he probably said, ` Leave me alone,''' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said. `` They tried to get in anyway, and he just popped them.''

 Three young whales trapped by ice were battered and bleeding and appeared to be weakening Monday, while a huge military helicopter prepared to tow an ice-breaking barge hundreds of miles in a last-ditch effort to free them. Rescuers used chain saws to keep two small breathing holes open in the six-inch thick <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ice, but freezing temperatures threatened to close them. The whales became trapped nearly two weeks ago while migrating south to warmer waters. The endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales, about 24 to 30 feet long, were bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged ice and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current to remain in place. `` They do n't look as spry. Their movements are diminished,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` Their condition has worsened since they were first spotted. One has a little pneumonia but the others are all right. But there's no question in my mind that they'll be here when the vehicle arrives,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. The whales were trapped about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo village. They were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45 feet of water, with their largest breathing hole about 10 feet by 20 feet. The whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minutes, said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist with the North Slope Borough. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said they have been surfacing about every two minutes, indicating they were becoming tired and stressed. Rescuers were racing against onshore winds that threatened to close leads in the ice that would serve as the whales' escape route if the ice-breaking barge is able to free them. Environmentalists, federal authorities and the oil industry have joined in an unlikely alliance to rush a barge to the whales so that it can smash a path to open water some seven miles away. A spindly <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> CH-54 Skycrane planned to lift off from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to tow the 185-ton barge 200 miles northwest to the beleaguered whales. The trip was expected to take from 25 to 40 hours. Crews labored around-the-clock during the weekend to get the barge and the Skycrane ready to go. The vessel, a Hovercraft-type barge, belongs to <ORGANIZATION> Veco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil field service company. Crews were being especially cautious as they prepared the rig Monday. `` We're checking under the rig, checking the airbags and checking anything that can go wrong,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Leathard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Veco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We're not going to move that thing until we can make sure we'll have a clean run to <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. The Arctic is not a good place to break down in winter.'' Plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85-by-60-foot barge with an 800-foot cable, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Haller </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` The plan has great potential for danger because of the atitude of the helicopter in the towing position. The nose is down,'' he said. `` The danger is that if a line snaps and comes back up and gets in the rotors, we've got real trouble.'' The helicopter, which costs $ 1,500 to $ 3,000 an hour to operate, will trade off with a second Skycrane which has been flown to <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The barge carried 20,000 gallons of fuel for the helicopters and the barge, <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said. The fuel was provided by <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Oil company officials have estimated the rescue effort could cost as much as $ 500,000 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> on Sunday with recordings of migrating whales which she wants to play along the ice floe to lure the whales to safety. The population of endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales numbers about 20,000 and has been growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, authorities said. The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> concluded an agreement Monday to guarantee <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military use of strategic air and naval bases in the Southeast Asian country through 1991 in exchange for $ 962 million in American aid. That represents an increase of $ 258 million in economic and military assistance as part of a complicated arrangement that permits the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to use `` a substantial portion'' to reduce its debt and bars <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers who test positive for AIDs from serving in the country. The successful conclusion of what at times had been difficult negotiations could foreshadow extension of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the strategic <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation beyond 1991, but the terms will have to be negotiated between the two sides, probably beginning next year. Another key provision of the agreement, which was released as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> signed the pact, maintains the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not disclosing whether ships or planes stopping at the bases or passing through carry nuclear weapons. `` These transits, overflights or visits will be conducted in accordance with existing procedures, which may be changed or modified, as necessary, by mutual agreement of both parties,'' the memorandum said. However, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government has the power to prohibit storing nuclear, chemical or other non-conventional weaponry on its territory. The nuclear issue was one of the key items that had to be settled before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be assured continued use of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and four lesser installations. The accord also deeds to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> all permanent facilities and improvements on buildings at the bases. The two governments pledged, meanwhile, to take steps to ensure a smooth transition of the bases to Philippine control if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decides in the future to abandon them. In a ceremony in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said that once Filipinos realize what the agreement gives them, they `` will accept it as an agreement that is in keeping with the expectations of our people, not only in the matter of compensation ... but also to other issues that we feel to be relevant to the question of national dignity.'' The agreement covers only the next two years. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hoped to begin talks with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government on use beyond 1991 `` in not too distant future.'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said the review does not resolve issues of criminal jurisdiction and military operations, which are likely to come up in the next talks. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> wants jurisdicton over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers who commit crimes and prior notice on any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations conducted from the bases. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would be influenced on the future of the bases by Filipinos' reaction to the agreement but was `` keeping her options open.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> quipped: `` Both sides are keeping their options open.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` just thrilled'' with the return of democracy in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and takes great pleasure and satisfaction with developments in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` I ` m bullish on the <LOCATION> Phillipines </LOCATION> and this is a continuation of that effort,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The agreement set the terms for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of the bases through 1991. Technically, the negotiations were a review of an existing bases agreement that the Aquino government never hinted at canceling, but the bargaining over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package, the nuclear issue and other key features contributed to a dramatic and politically tense chapter in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the former American colony. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday wrote Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in a three-page letter released at the ceremony that the agreement confirmed that the bases arrangement `` continues to meet our mutual needs and interests.'' But he reminded the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the authority to appropriate the aid covered in the accord. Military and economic aid to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is to be boosted to $ 481 million a year. That is more than 2 -LCB- times the $ 180 million a year <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged in 1983 over a five-year period to former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and $ 129 million above the $ 352 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is providing this year to the Aquino government. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said Sunday that the pact also includes an agreement on nuclear weapons and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for a bond program aimed at reducing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' $ 28 billion debt. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> are considered vital to regional and Western security interests across a wide part of the world stretching from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The terms fall short of the $ 1.2 billion that <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> originally wanted. He said, however, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials were never far apart on actual cash compensation in talks that began April 5 in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. He said the disagreements were over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to approve benefits and concessions that would not require congressional approval. Apart from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and economic aid, the agreement calls for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> underwriting of the cost of <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> security measures up to $ 4 million a year if funds can be found. The pact is expected to lead to talks next year on the long-term future of the bases, which many Filipinos want removed after the lease lapses in 1991. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not said whether she supports <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of the bases after 1991. Any new treaty would have to be approved by a two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a possible referendum. Failure to conclude the bases review, originally scheduled for July, has delayed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration endorsement of a $ 5 billion multilateral aid program proposed by two Republican and two Democratic members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. White House sources have said the president backs the plan, but it could not be set up until the amount of the base compensation was set. The debt relief plan linked to the bases accord is complex. It calls for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to put up <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds that would back a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> bond issue that initially would be exchanged for outstanding debts at 50 cents on the dollar, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said. Philippine officials previously said they would ask that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put up $ 100 million in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds to back a Philippine bond issue. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials agreed that the money would come from stepped-up payments of delayed fiscal 1988 and 1989 aid that previously could not be used to pay off the debt.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> staged a daylong general strike throughout the country's Moslem regions on Monday to protest <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s recognition of a Christian military Cabinet as the constitutional government. It came as Christian deputies decided to boycott a session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> set for Tuesday to elect a new speaker. Leaving Parliament without a speaker would undermine one of the last vestiges of a united <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The strike shut schools, stores, banks, cafes, restaurants and other businesses in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said similar shutdowns paralyzed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s northern, eastern and southern provinces. Street posters in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, Tyre and <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> read, `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s meddling threatens to break <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' and `` Hands off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The strike reflected <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> alarm over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military and political support of Christian forces seeking the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, governed by rival wings of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> party, have been at odds since the mid-1960s. Christian areas north and northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and a border enclave run by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia allies in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> did not participate in the strike. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reportedly shipped multibarreled rocket launchers, tanks and armored personnel carriers to the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war. The arms were seen as intended to stir trouble for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war that was halted by a cease-fire Aug. 20 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> considers <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within its sphere of influence. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last week became the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country to recognize the military <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, appointed by President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> minutes before <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ended Sept. 22. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, an editorial in the English-language <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> Times accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to undermine <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s unity Other Arab states have have remained neutral in the struggle between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s three-man Cabinet and the Syrian-backed, five-man government of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. The power struggle is solidifying a de facto partition of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into sectarian cantons because of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to elect a successor to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. Right-wing Christian members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have sabotaged the required quorum by boycotting sessions to elect a new president. The Christian deputies said they will boycott Tuesday's session, called to extend Shiite Moslem speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>'s mandate, or elect a successor. That could lead to disintegration of the Parliament. The Christians also are demanding a different meeting site for Parliament, citing security.

 Two former officers of a western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> firm pleaded guilty Monday to providing false information on a defense contract that inflated the cost of a fighter plane's radar by $ 1.8 million. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huntingdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambler </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, former vice president of operations, entered guilty pleas before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>. The men pleaded guilty to two counts of an 83-count federal indictment handed up June 15. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will dismiss the remaining counts in return. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcoline </PERSON> said the men falsified documents when presenting <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with hourly costs for the manufacture of actuators used in the radar units of F-15 fighter planes. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the actuator is a hydraulically operated component of the radar system located in the nose of the F-15. Each fighter has two actuators to move the radar horizontally and vertically, he said. In seeking payments from Sept. 1, 1982, to Oct. 1, 1986, the men had Nuclear Automation's controller inflate the time needed to build each actuator from 70 to 93 hours, resulting in an overpayment by the government to <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Marcoline </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the actuators were priced at about $ 6,500 each when they averaged about $ 5,100 each to manufacture. Nuclear Automation, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Esterline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, until November 1984, when it was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Neoax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is still making the devices for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the government said. <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> and Rambler were released on bond pending completion of presentence reports. Officials said they are to be sentenced Nov. 30 and face a maximum of five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine on each count.

<TEXT>
 The head of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation amplified on Monday his nation's call for establishment of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> and an expanded role for peacekeepers. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>'s statement to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committee echoed Soviet proposals already put before the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, but emphasized Soviet willingness to keep its innovations within the current <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter. `` We regard as generally sound the existing order under which <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operations are carried out,'' said <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>. However, he reiterated a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal for `` possible stationing of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers along frontiers within the territory of a country that seeks to protect itself from outside interference at the request of that country alone.'' Under present <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> practice, peacekeepers are not deployed unless all countries in the area consent. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>'s proposal would be of interest to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a Soviet ally, which has lodged numerous complaints that <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> rebels are using <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> as a base for staging cross-border raids into Afghan territory. More than 100,000 Soviet troops are withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under the U.N.-mediated Geneva Accords. Last month, however, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the next phase of the pullout depends on whether the Soviets and Afghans receive a satisfactory response to their complaints of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s alleged violations of the accords. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> also called for the use of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers in troubled areas before conflict breaks out, and posting observers along tense borders. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stands ready to set aside units of its military forces for use in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping, he said, suggesting that many nations also set aside troops who would serve as a reserve guard for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> offered the use of Soviet transports and logistical support for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which is ruled by neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Noting his previous calls for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval task force for the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> expanded the concept by suggesting the formation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, including minesweepers and escorts to protect commercial ships in dangerous international waters. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and other Western democracies have blocked similar packages of Soviet peacekeeping and international security proposals in the last two General Assembly sessions. Diplomats for the Western allies say many of the Soviet proposals have merit, but when combined into a `` comprehensive'' security proposal, they amount to a restructuring of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter, which the West opposes. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>'s references to innovations `` in accordance with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter'' appeared to be intended to allay such fears.

 Two shoppers suspected of having a stolen credit card shot and seriously wounded two security guards who tried to apprehend them in a department store Monday, authorities said. Customers and employees screamed and dove to the floor when shots rang out Monday afternoon at the <ORGANIZATION> Lazarus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>. `` I heard a lot of screaming,'' said salesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Langdon </PERSON>. `` I heard the gunshots and the glass breaking, people hitting the floor and just screaming.'' Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snitko </PERSON> said five people went to the store's handbag department, and two tried to use a credit card to buy clothing. The clerk checked the card number, found that it had been stolen and alerted security. Two unarmed plainclothes security officers answered the call. `` We're not sure what caused the suspects to shoot,'' she said. `` One of the male suspects fired two shots, each shot striking one of the security guards.'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 30, was in serious condition at <LOCATION> Methodist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with a gunshot wound to the stomach.

<TEXT>
 A prosecutor said Monday that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, wanted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for allegedly carrying out a string of murders, joined forces with a mass murderer in the early 1980s to kidnap targets for sex slayings. As <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s extradition hearing got under way amid tight security, Federal Crown prosecutor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> told a packed courtroom he will argue that <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> and his companion <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> `` were acting in concert to achieve the same overall objectives.'' Ng, 27, has been serving a 4 -LCB- - year sentence in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since his conviction in December 1985 of armed robbery during a botched shoplifting attempt in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> He came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> committed suicide. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> later was linked to the deaths or disappearances of 22 people. That investigation led to the charges against <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> told the court that <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> _ whose name is pronounced <ORGANIZATION> Ing </ORGANIZATION> _ and <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> became acquainted in the early 1980s. He said the two men moved to <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 120 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and built a series of underground rooms referred to as `` the bunker.'' There, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> told the court, Ng and <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> began to formalize a plan to kidnap people in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> area and take them to the bunker for what he called their own sexual gratification. The extradition hearing, scheduled to last 5 -LCB- weeks, is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to send Ng back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he faces 25 charges, including at least 10 of murder. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has a policy of not extraditing criminals who could face the death penalty, and is entitled to ask for leniency under the 1986 Canada-U.S. extradition treaty. The final decision regarding extradition rests with Justice Minister <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hnatyshyn </PERSON>. During Monday's court appearance, <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, a former marine, sat in the prisoner's box, wearing a navy T-shirt, and showed no emotion. He was shackled at the wrists and flanked by armed officers. Spectators entering the courtroom were searched with metal detectors. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellitto </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, whose 39-year-old brother, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosner </PERSON>, is one of a dozen people <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> is accused of murdering, said outside the courtroom Monday she wanted to see <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> face to face. `` As far as I'm concerned, I do n't want to hate a 2-by-2 picture that appears in all the newspapers,'' she said. `` I wanted to see him in person and make it real.'' <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, said that even if enough evidence is found to extradite <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, he will press Canadian authorities to demand a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantee his client wo n't be executed.

<TEXT>
 Lawyers for former President Gen. <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> asked a court Monday to cancel his trial for alleged human rights abuses in a case that led to tensions between soldiers and the civilian government. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> was due to appear in <ORGANIZATION> Rosario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday to answer charges stemming from the December 1976 shooting deaths of 13 political prisoners. Eighteen other retired generals or admirals face similar charges in trials that are resuming after a lapse of more than a year. Officers still are reluctant to testify. They have said the proceedings should be in military, not civilian court _ if held at all. `` There is a situation of understandable uneasiness,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an Oct. 11 interview in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- But -RRB- there is not the remotest possibility of a change in the -LRB- political -RRB- order.'' Low pay also has contributed to grumbling in the barracks, <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> said. He said a general earns about $ 1,053 a month and a conscript is paid about $ 5 a month. The national minimum wage is about $ 87 a month, he said. Military salaries have not kept up with inflation, which has soared 440 percent during the past 12 months. Also, the military share of the federal budget has shrunk by half since President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office in December 1983. It now stands at about 2 percent. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> replaced a military dictatorship that had ruled since President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was ousted by a coup in 1976. The human rights abuses occurred for the most part in the mid-1970s during the military's crackdown on leftists. A government commission issued a report in 1985 that said almost 9,000 people were arrested by security forces and never seen again. In December 1985, five of the nine military officers who served in ruling juntas between 1976 and 1983, including former presidents Gen. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, were convicted by federal court for crimes including kidnapping, torture and murder. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, president from December 1981 through June 1982, was commander of the 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION> on Dec. 13, 1976, when the political prisoners were slain. Soldiers of the 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> said the 13 tried to escape while being transferred from one jail to another. Witnesses said they were deliberately killed. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>'s attorneys initially asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to cancel the trial because only the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the military's highest court, was legally empowered to try <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected that argument on Oct. 3. On Monday, defense attorneys claimed <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> was tried and acquitted of the massacre during the 1985 trial. Prosecutors rejected that claim. The <ORGANIZATION> Rosario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was expected to rule shortly whether trial would go ahead as scheduled. <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s third largest city with 1 million residents, lies 185 miles northwest of the capital, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> currently is serving a 12-year sentence after he was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> in May 1986 of mismanaging the 1982 war with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. A civilian court is reviewing that decision. Prosecutor <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to increase the sentence to 18 years in prison. Relations between the civilian government and the military, in power for most of the years between the 1955 coup that ousted President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s election five years ago, have always been sensitive. In April 1987, three garrisons revolted after Maj. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Barreiro </PERSON> refused to appear in court and face trial for alleged human rights violations. A month later, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the `` Due Obedience'' law that stated only generals could be charged with human rights abuses from that point on. Cases against hundreds of lower-ranking officers were dropped, because they allegedly were only following orders. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who proposed the legislation, said it was necessary to avert civil war.

 First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed regret Monday that she failed to heed the advice of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawyers that she formally disclose her borrowing of gowns and other designer apparel. But her press secretary and a government ethics spokesman said there was no legal requirement that she do so. Press Secetary <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> acknowledged that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had reported such loans when the issue first arose in November 1981, saying the first lady then decided `` to err on the side'' of compliance with the law. Since 1982, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has continued to borrow and return items without reporting the transactions, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said, even though <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawyers originally had recommended disclosure as a precautionary measure. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regrets that she failed to heed counsel's advice,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said in a formal statement late Monday `` Nevetheless, no reporting rules or laws were violated.''

<HEAD>`Accused' Seeks to Challenge Rape Stereotypes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inside a scruffy tavern called The Mill, patrons sip beer, a boxing match flickers on television, a jukebox plays and back in the game room, a group of men gang-rape a woman atop a pinball machine while others cheer them on. In the new movie `` The Accused,'' it's just another wild night out for the rapists and their chanting throng. `` The Accused,'' which chronicles the crusade of a rape victim -LRB- <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> -RRB- to bring both her assaulters and their applauding spectators to justice, shows in frank detail what rape is really about. And for actress <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, who plays the prosecutor, the movie had an even more personal note. `` I was raped by two men in my apartment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1982, so for me it's far more than a movie,'' said <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, who found that while watching the completed film was `` difficult,'' it did address some important issues. The actress only recently began talking publicly about the crime. In a recent interview with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, she said she decided to speak out after attending a fund-raiser at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> rape treatment center. `` I was overwhelmed by the strength of the women I met and thought that I had been a coward by not speaking out myself,'' she said in the interview. <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> was not the only person associated with the film who had an intimate knowledge of rape and its aftermath. A former girlfriend of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, the movie's director, was gang-raped for 12 hours in their apartment while <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> was out of town, he said. `` Rape has almost become a right of initiation at fraternity houses,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, who co-produced `` The Accused'' with <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>. `` That's appalling. ... What I hope will happen is that no one will everlook at a rape victim the same way again,'' <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> said. `` No one will ever say, ` She asked for it.''' Foster's character, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, is a provocative and foul-mouthed waitress who likes to have a good time. But the film points out, as courts and women's groups have over the past few years, that the <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobiases </PERSON> are just as much a victim as women who are more demure and sheltered. `` The incredible thing about the rape scene in the movie is that it is n't sexual,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` It's about violating humanity, and saying, ` This is n't a person. This is like a piece of something to serve my purposes.''' Hollywood has confronted rape before, and fairly graphically in movies such as `` Lipstick'' and `` Extremities.'' However, `` The Accused'' comes more directly from real life. It is strongly reminiscent of a 1983 case in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in which a woman was gang-raped on a pool table at <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dan </ORGANIZATION>'s bar, as several patrons either whooped encouragement or failed to intervene. The tavern was in a section of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> heavily populated by Portuguese-Americans. Six men, all of <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> descent, were charged in the case. Four were convicted and two were acquitted. Paramount Pictures, responding to criticism from Portuguese-American groups who said the movie will open old wounds, issued a disclaimer saying `` The Accused'' was not based on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> incident. The movie, in part, focuses on the prosecution of the onlookers, who are charged with criminal solicitation. `` The movie came about because I've wanted to do a movie about the responsibility that you have as a bystander, a witness, and how sometimes you're just as culpable when you watch something as when you actually participate,'' <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> said. To challenge the myth that women who say `` no'' actually mean `` yes,'' <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> is brazen. That she chooses, on one evening at The Mill, to be sexually aggressive and let her guard down does not mean she wants men to do whatever they please. `` For a minute in her life she said, ` I'm not going to feel danger.' And she ends up paying the consequences for being herself, and that's a really sad thing,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` If I want to show that a woman always has the right to say no _ no matter if she's drunk, or stoned, or sexy or whatever _ I have to paint a character who, in the beginning, I want to dismiss,'' <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> said. `` But by the time you see what happened, I do n't think anybody could walk out of that movie and think that girl deserved to be raped. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> said it would be wrong to consider this a message film. `` If you want to send a message, you go to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' she said. ` First and foremost, you have to do a piece of entertainment that people will enjoy. And then you slip your message in. The best film entertains you, and then you walk out of the theater and start to talk.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>: `` I do n't think a film can change a whole social pattern. But I do hope that what this film will do is to inspire people to start asking questions. That's the beginning of education.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ the home of rap music and rappers Run-DMC, <PERSON> Kool </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> and LL Cool J _ is also home to more murders each year than any other place in the nation: 1,691 last year. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Krisna </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> _ aka rapper KRS-One _ learned a lot about both in 1987. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, voice of the group <ORGANIZATION> Boogie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Down </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, scored a successful debut album with `` Criminal Minded'' just months before his music partner was gunned down by two teen-agers during a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> street dispute. It was the latest twist in the strange tale of <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s life, a life in which he's lived in city subways, city shelters and a city jail. `` Every little bit of negativity I was up against was grounds for me to stay positive,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said in an interview during the band's recent tour. `` It kept me alive.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> left his home in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> at age 13; he moved into the borough's lush Prospect Park, sleeping outdoors in the summer and in the subways when the temperatures dropped. He eventually entered the dangerous city shelter system; at one point, a drug bust landed him in the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> for 60 days. `` It was like a chopped-up situation _ from shelter to apartment to shelter to street,'' said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. `` That whole period was from age 15 to 20.'' While residing at the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> shelter in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, he met counselor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, better known as DJ <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRock </PERSON>. `` I was the youngest client, he was the youngest social worker,'' recalled <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. `` It was like we were destined to hook up.'' It was n't <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> meeting <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Quarry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, but it was enough to convince both they had a future in music. They picked up several other residents from shelters, and some other friends. Boogie Down Productions was born. When `` Criminal Minded'' was released last year, they scored a hit; despite very little radio support, it sold more than 300,000 copies. <PERSON> LaRock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> were heavily into preparing the follow-up when the DJ was murdered on Aug. 26, 1987, after intervening in a dispute over a woman. In May, two <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> teen-agers were arrested and charged in the slaying. Although <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s violent death cast a pall over <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and company, the rapper says he did not consider quitting. `` Never. The thought never crossed my mind for a second,'' he said. `` This album was already done before <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> passed away _ not done on tape, done in our heads. I'm just carrying out an agreement that me and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> made.'' Included on the second LP, `` By All Means Necessary,'' are two cuts which decry the city's problems with the drug `` crack'' and with crime: `` Stop The Violence'' and `` Illegal Business.'' The problem, says <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, is delivering the message without giving a lecture. `` The approach is not to sound like their mother and father _ people do n't want to hear that,'' he said. `` The approach is to sound like their brother or their homeboy.'' The approach is also to sound fresh, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> added. `` Personally, I listen to the radio to know what not to sound like,'' he said. `` I could run the list down for days of who not to sound like. You could say everybody in the music industry at this point except <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Heron </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>6th-Century Coffin Yields Evidence of Korean Cultural Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By K.P. HONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese archaeologists say a 6th-century stone coffin opened in a previously untouched tomb contains dozens of treasures showing a strong likelihood of Korean cultural influence in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A government research team lifted the two-ton lid off the vermillion-colored coffin Oct. 8 at the Fujinoki Tumulus, or mound, in <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION> prefecture, the heartland of ancient <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Japanese newspapers and television have given the discovery extensive coverage while the archaeologists carefully drain water from the coffin to retrieve the encrusted articles. They say the treasures include at least three swords, a pair of gilt-bronze shoes, a golden necklace, earrings, ornaments and other accessories. The coffin also contains human bones and remnants of cloth. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Kashihara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION> prefecture, in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, say recovery of the relics and remains will take several weeks. The identity of the person buried in the tomb is not known. Professor <PERSON> Kyoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arimitsu </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kyoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who directed the <ORGANIZATION> Kashihara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in 1980-1984, said the relics were believed to be from one of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s three ancient kingdoms _ <LOCATION> Silla </LOCATION>, Paekche or <LOCATION> Koguryo </LOCATION>. `` They are similar to those found in tumuluses in the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview after inspecting the excavation. <PERSON> Kazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Uehara </PERSON>, a professor of art history at <ORGANIZATION> Seijo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, agrees with <PERSON> Arimitsu </PERSON>. `` When a set of harness was found at the Fujinoki Tumulus three years ago, some people disagreed with my view that it might have come from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` They said the harness looked more like Chinese. `` The remains in the stone coffin, I believe, will correct their theory. I know, of course, there are similarities between ancient Chinese culture and that of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. However, they are not the same. For instance, hexagonal ornaments extracted from the stone coffin have been found only in Korean tumuluses. `` There are some Japanese scholars who would hesitate to accept the fact that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> received more cultural heritage from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. ... The tendency, I believe, stems from an attitude of looking down on a small country like <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' The tomb and mound date from the Yamato period, which ran from early in the Christian era through 710. <ORGANIZATION> Yamato </ORGANIZATION> is the ancient name for mountainous <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION> prefecture, where the first unified state in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was based. Members of its ruling class were buried in mounds. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> made their first peaceful contacts during the Yamato period and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> began its long history of adopting and adapting the cultures of others. Writing in Chinese characters was imported from <LOCATION> Paekche </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 285. In the next 300 years, through contacts with <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the Japanese learned of the formidable and advanced culture of the Asian mainland. <PERSON> Arimitsu </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Fujinoki </LOCATION> mound was believed to have been created between 551 and 575. It is about 600 yards from the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple <LOCATION> Horyuji </LOCATION>, built between 601 and 607 in the town of <LOCATION> Ikaruga </LOCATION>, 8 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION>. Excavation of the mound, which is 30 feet high, began in 1985. About 3,500 relics have been found, including exquisite gold and bronze objects, in addition to the stone coffin. Archaeologists viewed the coffin's interior in June, using a flexible instrument with a lens on the end, and set up a chain-and-pulley mechanism to raise the heavy, peaked cover.

 Skull and <PERSON> Bones </PERSON>, the oldest and most secret senior society at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, boasts many distinguished alumni but none more prominent today than a `` spook'' from the class of 1948 _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Little is known about the strange rituals and practices of the 156-year-old society, and that's the way its members want it. The rites are rumored to include placing initiates in a coffin and requiring them to plunge naked into a pile of mud. Some of the rumors come from rival societies, and may be suspect. No one but members really know what goes on inside the windowless, mausoleum-style structure of brown sandstone to which Bonesmen retreat. But as the Republican presidential nominee's own experience has shown, membership in the society forms powerful bonds of friendship that endure long after graduation. The vice president was one of 15 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> juniors tapped for Skull and Bones in 1947. To this day, the Bonesmen who once heard him recount some of the innermost secrets of his life remain his good friends. Perhaps because of the pledge of secrecy that Bonesmen take, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention his Skull and Bones membership in his autobiography, `` Looking Forward.'' The society has long been suspected of ritualistic thefts. A group of history buffs in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, claimed that the skull referred to in the society's name belongs to <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> revolutionary <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, whose grave was robbed in 1926. <PERSON> Endicott </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, a lawyer who says he speaks for Skull and Bones, said the society does not have the skull. The former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apache </ORGANIZATION> tribe in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> charged recently that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, stole the skull of Apache chief <PERSON> Geronimo </PERSON> years ago, and that it is still on display at Skull and Bones' inner sanctum. That claim was denied by the vice president's brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. One thing is not disputed: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the Bonesman is in powerful company. Brothers of the order have included <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Averell </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeish </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a Republican senator from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, was a member So was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oldest son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and about a half-dozen other family members. Skull and Bones is arguably the most famous and influential secret society in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, having served as a model for others that followed at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and other institutions. It was founded by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> Class of 1833, apparently in reaction to the stripping of secrecy from Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic society, during the rise of a national anti-secrecy movement. Skull and Bones is a private organization incorporated as the <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It pays taxes to the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> and owns <LOCATION> Deer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a resort on the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Giving Skull and Bones the benefit of the doubt, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, in a 1974 history of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, wrote of the society: `` Its purpose and programs were not revealed when it was founded and have never since been known. But that like most <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> societies it pretends to some intellectual and educational purpose can probably be assumed.'' The society `` comes from a tradition of elitism of which <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> was at the center,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oren </PERSON>, author of `` Joining The Club,'' a book published in 1985 about the relationship between the university and Jews. Skull and <PERSON> Bones </PERSON> became the first of the secret societies to admit a Jew in 1937. During the 1960s, the society tapped a number of outspoken radicals. Even today, however, it remains steadfastly all-male. Of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s seven secret undergraduate societies, only one other _ <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s Head _ refuses to admit women. Having women as members would interfere with one of the ways Bonesmen become true brothers. By all accounts, Skull and Bones initiates must lay bare their souls, telling their sexual histories and life stories in graphic detail. `` The danger of secret societies and entering into the club world is it allows members to lose sight of the common folk who are n't part of the elite,'' <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> said. But he said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experiences in World War II combat worked the other way `` For so many veterans, their fight was against the racists and the bigoted values of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, so when they came back, they were embued with a strong sense of egalitarianism,'' <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 21 and already married, entered <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 after his discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for his wartime exploits. While on one combat mission, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plane was shot down and he was rescued by a submarine. Two fellow crewmen perished. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted his brush with death for <PERSON> Bonesmen </PERSON> in 1947 with great emotion, says former Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W.L </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, another member of the Bones class of 1948. `` What comes to mind was, he was an awful young guy who had had an idyllic kind of childhood who suddenly found himself in an airplane that was on fire facing a lot of death around him and almost certain death himself,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and other Bonesmen in his <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> class are still close friends of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Obviously, we became fond of each other,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. `` This was something kind of special to us.'' He added: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is exactly just as loyal to other friends as those who happened to be in the society with him. His friendship across the social range is known to everyone.'' Members of the Bones class of 1948 came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1981 for a reunion that included dinner at the vice president's mansion and a tour of the White House Oval Office. `` His having been a member of Skull and Bones and his continued involvement as an alumnus means he would probably be likely to draw upon past connections for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> said. `` But his choice of people _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to be campaign manager, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as vice president _ shows he's willing to go beyond <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> said. `` He has always maintained close connections to Skull and <PERSON> Bones </PERSON>, but his world certainly goes beyond <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>.''

 Ventriloquist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> asks, ` How do you spell <PERSON> Tigger </PERSON>?'' and slips into a voice fitting for a cartoon tiger: `` T-I-double grrrr-E-R.'' <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>, during an interview, frequently demonstrates the range of cartoon voices he does for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> But there are faint echoes across the executive dining room atop the animation building at the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. You hear a `` Quack, Quack!'' here and a `` Quack, Quack!'' there. Other people at other tables are also doing cartoon voices. For a moment you feel you've wandered into the Ink and <ORGANIZATION> Paint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>?'' For the last 20 years, <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> has been the voice of <PERSON> Tigger </PERSON>, the zany tiger in the animated versions of <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milne </PERSON>'s beloved `` Winnie the Pooh.'' The first effort, `` Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day,'' won an Academy Award as best animated movie short in 1968. It has now become a Saturday morning series on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> as `` The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.'' <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>, in fact, does voices for two other Saturday morning shows: Disney's `` Gummi Bears'' and <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>'s `` The Smurfs.'' He's also done voices for such movies as <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Aristocats'' and `` The Fox and the Hound.'' Until he began working on cartoons, <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> was better known as a ventriloquist and the man behind dummies <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Knucklehead </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. His dummies are now at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At the age of 13 he was a winner on radio's `` Amateur Hour'' for doing his imitation of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ventriloquist </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> was his childhood hero, and <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> said one of the greatest thrills of his life was a joint appearance with <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> on the game show `` Masquerade Party.'' `` We appeared as Dr. <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>,'' he said. `` After we unmasked, we picked up each other's dummies. I did <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, and he did <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>. It was a magic moment.'' <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> made his television debut in 1947 and within a year was host of `` The Bigelow Show.'' He was also host of a number of children's shows, including `` The <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell-Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> Show'' and `` Circus Time.'' `` I first met Walt Disney 25 or 30 years ago,'' he recalled. `` He said, ` We're both in the same business. I use cartoons and you use dummies and we both entertain children.' That was long before I started working here. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> gave me a VIP tour of the studio. I remember people doing voices. I said, ` Gee, that must be fun.' And here I am. `` Ventriloquism today is in a slump. Children today have n't been exposed to it. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> was an enormous hit in radio. But I think television defeats ventriloquism. Children are so used to seeing puppets that when they see a real ventriloquist they do n't understand it On television, everyone talks and they do n't care about the mechanics.'' <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>, white-haired at 66, suffered a heart attack two years ago. `` My cardiologist said I could still do voices,'' he said, `` but to avoid working with the rest of the cast to avoid the stress. The studio's been very nice to me. I can come in, do my voices alone. I was able to do some of them in a recording studio in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> when I was visiting there.'' He said when he does a voice he likes to create an entire character. `` Many people do different voices, but the basic rhythm is always the same,'' he said. `` I try to do more than just using a falsetto or pitching my voice. I always look for little distinctions in each voice. Little characteristics or idiosyncrasies. `` Tigger, for instance, has a little lisp and a little laugh. My wife is British and has a lot of sayings that I throw in. She'll say, ` TTFN Ta-ta for now.' So <PERSON> Tigger </PERSON> will say that and laugh. It gives a character more dimension.'' <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> is writing an autobiographical novel, which he jokingly calls `` Dummy Dearest.'' It's actually called `` The <ORGANIZATION> Strange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION>'' and will closely parallel his own career and life.

<HEAD>Halloween Safety Urged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of youthful ghosts and goblins will be taking to the streets in the annual ritual of trick or treat at the end of the month, and that means adults need to take some special care to make it a safe celebration. For children, Halloween is an occasion for merrymaking and the fun can result in carelessness on their part. Grown-ups need to be aware of this and be ready to compensate. Jack-o-Lanterns containing candles, for example, should be kept away from landings and doorsteps where long flowing costumes could come in contact with the flames, warns the federal <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Indoors, make sure that these lanterns are away from curtains, decorations and furnishings that could be ignited. Homes welcoming the visits of costumed youngsters should display a light, and residents ought to pick up things like garden hoses and lawn ornaments that could trip children. Parents, the <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says, should tell their offspring to go only to homes where a welcoming light is on. And they should be warned never to enter the home or apartment of a stranger. Setting a specific time for them to be home can be a good idea. When shopping for costumes, look for ones labeled flame resistant, the commission says. This does n't mean the product wo n't burn, but at least it will resist ignition, and will extinguish easily if a fire starts Flimsy skirts and costumes with big, baggy sleeves should be avoided because of the danger of contact with fire. Make costumes short enough to avoid tripping, and dress youngsters in shoes that fit _ mom's high heels can be a hazard to youngsters, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> warns. Make costumes light and bright enough to be easily visible to motorists. Decorating or trimming the costume with reflective tape can be a big help. These reflective tapes can be seen by drivers even when traveling at high speeds, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reports. Bags intended for goodies can also be decorated with reflective tape, and children should also carry flashlights to help them see and be seen. The commission urges using natural masks of cosmetics rather than buying the child a plastic or cardboard mask which can obstruct vision and even restrict breathing. Swords, knives and similar costume accessories should be soft and flexible. Warn children not to eat any of the treats before they get home and then examine all the items carefully before allowing them to be eaten. Be especially wary of treats that are not wrapped in original wrappers. In many areas local hospitals offer to X-ray Halloween treats and some local police departments have programs too. Small children should be accompanied by an adult on their rounds and all youngsters should be warned against running out from between cars or across lawns, where ornaments, furniture or clotheslines may prove dangerous to them. Adult drivers need to be aware of the large numbers of children who will be out and need to watch for them in the streets or darting out unexpectedly. Be especially wary when pulling into driveways and alleys. And finally, bring in your pets on Halloween night, urges the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Black cats seem to be particularly subject to cruelty on this evening, and even dogs in their own yards are n't safe from thoughtless or cruel people, the society warns. Keep pets inside or on a secure leash if walking them. Dogs or cats frightened by the sight of costumed children may also bite or scratch, the society warns, and keeping the pet away from the holiday confusion can prevent these problems. And remember, pets are like children in one way, letting them consume candy, gum and cookies can lead to an upset stomach.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a young idealist and his reward was 16 years in prison. Now he helps other foreigners find keys to the doors of commerce in his adopted land. <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON>, 67, is president of <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON>, a consulting firm that helps foreign clients, most of their American, get information and access to Chinese officials. Since establishing the firm a year ago, <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> has found markets and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> partners for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers of gas turbines, pencils, jeans and electrical appliances, and guided them through the enigmatic world of Chinese contract negotiations. He has organized tours for such as evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, sometimes acting as interpreter in impeccable Mandarin at meetings with senior Chinese leaders. `` I like the feeling that we're building little bridges,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> began building his bridges decades ago, with some disastrous consequences. He is a native of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and first came to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1945, as a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> interpreter after studying Chinese at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>. Like other young American liberals caught up in the turbulence, <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> was attracted by the zeal and idealism of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s revolutionaries `` I was taken with the idea they were going to build a new kind of just, democratic socialist society,'' he said. After leaving the Army he decided to stay in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, at the urging of <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> and other leaders, to help establish an English-language radio service. When Chinese authorities put him in the back of a truck going to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1949, he thought he was being enlisted to help negotiate relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s new Communist government. `` I was euphoric,'' he said. Instead, <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> was imprisoned on charges of being an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy. He learned later that Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> demanded his arrest, claiming <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> was an accomplice of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, who had been arrested in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for spying. She and <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> were collaborating on a biography of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. Six years in prison followed, the first of them in an unlighted room with black cloth over the windows. When he was released and cleared of wrongdoing in 1955, `` <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> apologized to me,'' he said. `` They really felt bad about it and took me into the family.'' Back at Radio <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, he was made privy to material seldom revealed to outsiders. `` That was power, access to inside information,'' he said in the interview. His world collapsed once more during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Again he was deceived. He said he thought the Cultural Revolution, with which <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> dislodged the entrenched bureaucracy, `` was a great day, a kind of town hall democracy.'' But the radical leftists who gained power revived the old spying charges and jailed him in 1968. He spent 10 years in solitary and his <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> wife, <PERSON> Yulin </PERSON>, was sentenced to three years in a labor camp. `` There was only one real issue, keeping your sanity from day to day,'' he said of the lost decade. `` I tried not to be bitter. In solitary, bitterness is the enemy. But who are you going to be sore at? It was the whole system.'' He said he felt freedom was near when he heard <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, yelling from a nearby cell. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> says personally prolonged his prison term, was arrested in late 1976 as ringleader of the notorious `` Gang of Four.'' Again released and again exonerated, he was given a sinecure with the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, helping arrange academic exchanges. In 1979 he returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time in 34 years. <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> now spends about half the year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His consulting firm has an office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and he has a home in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where one of his four children also lives. His hope that Chinese communism would be `` different from the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, more civilized and democratic,'' dissolved long ago. `` <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> went back on his promises,'' he said, and if the democratic socialism he once envisioned for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ever comes, `` it will be nothing resembling <ORGANIZATION> Marxist-Leninist </ORGANIZATION> societies so far.'' After so many years away, <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> said, he finds the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be a more humane country. `` The leaders of the Chinese revolution did n't understand that if not everyone is protected by law then no one is,'' he said. `` Our forefathers were smart enough to build that into the system.'' <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> worries about corruption in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where young people `` have no 10 Commandments and no Communist ideology'' and party officials are among the greediest. He said there are `` thieves galore built into the system,'' but believes a `` kind of self-correcting mechanism'' will see <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> through. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` have a special chemistry and there's no reason it should n't cement and grow,'' <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> said. `` I feel kind of good it is happening now.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bolstered by a personal fortune worth millions, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> is on her way to becoming a force in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a power-broker with the clout to make and break candidates. Forget the men in smoke-filled rooms. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> is a new breed of wheeler-dealer, driven by a conviction that society will be a better place if more women are elected to high office. To that end, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> four years ago created <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List, a political action committee that funnels money to select women candidates around the country. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> has three criteria for her list. Candidates must be Democrats, support the Equal Rights Amendment and endorse a pro-choice stand on abortion. `` When you're on <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List, that really means something,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>, 41, a tall, straight-talking woman with few pretenses and a relaxed manner. Usually what it means is enough money, early on, for a candidate to run a viable campaign through the general election. `` Emily's List was absolutely crucial to my campaign,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., one of the two women in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said it is a `` tremendous boost'' to be placed on the list. `` They are willing to come out early and endorse; most national groups are reluctant to make an early endorsement.'' <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> came up with the name <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List to underscore her commitment to backing candidates early in a race. The name <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> stand for `` Early Money Is Like Yeast'' _ it makes the dough rise. In 1986, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List endorsed only two candidates, <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, who lost her bid for the Missouri <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. This year, nine women _ all <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates running in open seats or trying to oust incumbents _ have been recommended as beneficiaries of more than $ 500,000 collected from list members. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List differs from many political action committees in the way it distributes money. PACs are restricted from giving more than $ 5,000 in the primary and $ 5,000 in the general to any candidate. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List recommends women and then asks people to write checks to the candidate of choice. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List processes the checks and distributes them. The practice, called `` bundling,'' allows a candidate to collect unlimited funds from a number of invididuals, each of whom can give no more than $ 1,000 in the primary and the general election. About 2,000 people contribute to candidates on <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List. A committed Democrat, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> worked in a variety of public interest jobs before she founded <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List. She was an organizer for Common Cause, the public interest lobby, and served as press secretary for the National Women's Political Caucus. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>'s wealth springs from her multi-million dollar inheritance from her great-grandfather, a founder of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. She serves as a volunteer, giving <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s List a maximum allowable contribution of $ 25,000 annually. A graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Hollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> holds a degree in experimental psychology and a business degree from <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. One political development that disconcerts <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> is the failure of Democratic women to move more quickly into high positions. Republican women, many of them moderates, have made faster gains in modern day politics. `` The reason Republican woman are moving up quickly is that the party helps recruit women,'' providing them with needed financial support early in their careers, she said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a fund-raiser for Republican candidates, thinks there are other reasons why more <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> women get elected, even though more women run as Democrats. `` Polling data shows that Democrats have a problem being seen as competent and Republicans have a problem being seen as passionate,'' she said. That perception helps Republican women because they are easily able to counter the notion they are unfeeling.

Conservative groups in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a nation of 5.5 million paople about the size of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, say the 35,000-member student body has become a fifth column of subversives. Some students, teachers and alumni contend, however, that radical student unions do not represent the majority. Like nearly all national universities in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s is financed by the state but remains autonomous. The government has virtually nothing to do with its administration. Police and soldiers are forbidden by law from entering the grounds, but that did not prevent a military-dominated regime from invading the school in 1980 and shutting it down for four years. When President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, visited the campus last year to inspect damage done by a severe earthquake, catcalls and shouted insults drowned out his attempts to speak. `` If we examine the institutions that identify with the needs and aspirations of the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people, we find they are all politicized because we are in the middle of a war,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> <PERSON> Antillon </PERSON>, a leftist economist who is the university's rector `` These institutions can not withdraw themselves from that war. No one can remain neutral,'' he told an interviewer in his office. A conservative alumni group alleged in paid announcements published last month that `` the standard bearers of terrorism'' had taken over the student body with the object of `` fomenting social disorder.'' Student unions use demonstrations for increased government spending on education as a pretext for `` acts of terrorism'' in the streets, the ads said. Among about 3,000 students in a march for more funds Sept. 13 were 200 with bandannas over their faces, carrying iron staves or nail-studded wooden clubs. The military says some masked marchers are guerrilla `` urban commandos.'' That march ended in a melee of tear gas and flailing clubs when 300 riot troopers moved in on the demonstrators. The driver of a police truck was killed, allegedly shot by a marcher. About 250 people were arrested and 14 charged with subversive affiliation. All eventually were released for lack of evidence. <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> said security forces frustrated at release by the courts of people they consider subversive might resort to kidnapping and murder to quell student action. Two young men carrying books entered a university cafeteria Oct. 3, walked up to custodian <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Escamilla </PERSON>, drew pistols and shot him to death. A university statement called the killing `` part of a government and military campaign against the university.'' <PERSON> Escamilla </PERSON>, 34, was arrested by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and held for several days last year on suspicion of affiliation with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a journalism professor, worries about the effect of radical activism on academic standards. `` The effort to keep classes from politicizing is constant,'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said, and he tries to teach according to `` scientific'' criteria, `` but because of the context of conflict that is very difficult.'' The rector, Arqueta, contends `` We can not think in terms of academic level for its own sake.'' He said medical school graduates had enjoyed success in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a testament to their training, `` but the fact we turned out good doctors did not lower our infant mortality rate or provide better conditions of public health or increase life expectancy.'' <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> is presiding over a revision of the rules to require that future graduates contribute 500 hours of `` social service'' in their fields. Asked why no centrist or rightist student union had been formed, he noted that 75 percent of students were from families of workers or peasants while `` the expressions of the center and the right are minority expressions.'' `` Realizing they are in the minority, they do n't want to get into an open confrontation of ideas,'' he said of students from the political center and right. One student, speaking privately, said conservatives on campus are intimidated by the radical `` minority.'' `` When they come into a lecture hall and announce that class is suspended for a march or a sit-in, maybe three or four out of 80 take part in the activity,'' she said. Many conservative students express their opinions on lavatory walls. A tour turned up condemnations of the guerrillas and leftist student unions, generally unprintable, and `` Vivas'' for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> leads the rightist Arena party, which won control of the legislature this year, and is said to have headed rightist death squads accused of killing thousands of alleged leftists in the early 1980s.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The government of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> this month announced an environmental plan aimed primarily at slowing the uncontrolled burning of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle by farmers and ranchers, a practice which among other things has aggravated the worldwide `` greenhouse effect.'' Here is a report on the slash-and-burn land clearing that has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest in the past 10 years.

 Acrid smoke rises two miles high from the slash-and-burn fires ravaging the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest as peasant farmers and big cattle ranchers alike try to tame the jungle for food and profit. With tens of thousands of square miles of lush green vegetation put to the torch each year, many scientists and environmentalists view it as an ecological disaster, not only destroying the forest but poisoning the earth's atmosphere. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that since 1978 this type of land clearing has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest cover, an area larger than <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` At this rate, the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle could become an immense desert within 100 years,'' says <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON>, an environmental engineer with the Brazilian government's <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Further, a report by the institute said the amount of smoke from the burnings is 1,000 times more than that emitted by the 1982 eruption of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s El Chichon volcano, which caused `` serious alterations in the chemical composition of the earth's atmosphere.'' Critics charge that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has allowed haphazard and destructive settlement of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, which covers an area roughly two-thirds the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and encompasses 30 percent of the world's tropical rain forests. Saying he was alerted by the disclosure that scientists had found more than 6,000 man-made fires in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> in a single day, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> on Oct. 12 announced a new environmental-protection program. The program, called `` Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end to government tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattle ranching in the northern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> and a ban on exports of unprocessed tropical timber. `` We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all passengers in the adventure of Man on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said in announcing the program. `` The era of unlimited natural resources is over.'' The `` Our Nature'' program also contains a recommendation to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut mercury imports. Free-lance gold prospectors throughout the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> use the highly toxic element to separate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into the water. `` This program is going to shake up powerful economic interests,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimaraes </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s federal <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` But the government is resolved to carry it out.'' Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> permitted land developers to burn off 50 percent of their properties _ the fastest and cheapest way to open up clear areas _ and then gave them tax deductions for doing so. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> already had some environmental-protection laws in place, but because of the country's vast size, deteriorating economic situation and scarcity of real enforcement power, the laws were largely ignored. Scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> say that jungle fires last year released nearly 500 million tons of carbonic gases into the atmosphere, making <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> one of the chief contributors to the `` greenhouse effect'' that is dangerously warming the earth's climate Scientific studies warn that rising global temperatures could eventually cause the inundation of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European coastal cities and the parching of prime heartland farm areas in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION>, capital of the jungle state of <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION> in far western <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, a physical scientist with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space agency, said the burnings in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> were responsible for 10 percent of the carbon dioxide existing in the earth's atmosphere today. Carbon dioxide is `` the major greenhouse gas,'' he said. The fires in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> also are responsible for large quantities of carbon monoxide, methane and nitrogen oxides, scientists say. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> works for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and his main task is to trace emissions in the atmosphere from tropical forest burnings. The state with the largest percentage of its <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> forest cover destroyed by fire is <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION>, roughly the size of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which has become a mecca for hundreds of thousands of down-and-out peasant farmers and free-lance gold prospectors, along with some big-scale farmers and ranchers. <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Catanhede </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION> director of the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, says than 26,000 square miles of jungle, or close to 28 percent of the state's territory, has been burned over the past 13 years. During the May-to-October dry season, the burning <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> casts a cloud of smoke over <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION>, partially blocking out the sun. Drivers have to switch on their headlights during the day, and the airport is frequently shut down because of lack of visibility.

 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> da Costa <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, a physicist with the space institute, says, `` The burning of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> is not only poisoning the atmosphere and affecting the earth's ozone layer, it is also reducing the rain forest's capacity to produce oxygen.'' He says that although it is an exaggeration to call the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> the `` lungs of the world,'' a phrase often found in press accounts, the Brazilian jungle is a `` major contributor of the oxygen breathed by mankind.'' Along BR364, the 900-mile asphalt highway that slices through the jungle to connect <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cuiaba </LOCATION>, capital of the state of <LOCATION> Mato </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grosso </LOCATION>, the charred and still smoldering remains of once majestic <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> nut, rubber and brazilwood trees stand in mute testimony to man's destructiveness. Along the highway, homesteaders, their faces blackened by trees turned to charcoal, struggle to clear their land and plant crops such as rice, corn and cassava before the rains come. <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nonato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, 50, owns 123 acres of land about 60 miles outside <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION>. He burned about 50 acres to plant cassava, a tropical root that yields a coarse flour and serves as `` bread'' for impoverished peasants. During a break from work, he wipes perspiration from his brow with his forearm and says, `` This is the second time I have burned this plot. Next year, nothing will grow on it, and I will have to burn some more of my land.'' Neither <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, his 38-year-old wife, <PERSON> Raimunda </PERSON>, nor their two young children have any idea what the greenhouse effect is all about. But, expressing a kind of instinctive concern, the Brazilian says, `` I know it's wrong to burn the jungle, but I have no other choice. I have no money to buy a tractor, which would let me clear the land without burning it.'' <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, like thousands of other homesteaders, received his plot free of charge from the government. `` But before I could receive title to my land, I was told I had to clear it off, and the best, cheapest and fastest way to do so was to slash and burn.'' Another peasant farmer, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, 48, asks, `` Where am I supposed to grow the food to feed my family? On top of the trees? If I do n't cut down the forest and burn it, I will starve.'' Catanhede, of the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, says the worst offenders are the owners of large cattle ranches who `` burn more and more land each year to create pastureland to feed their growing herds. `` After two or three burnings the land is completely depleted of all its nutrients. Nothing will grow on it. The farmer then slashes and burns some more virgin forest to continue growing crops, and the cattle raiser does the same to get more pastureland.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> tries to control the burnings by issuing special licenses and setting limits on how much can be burned on a given property. Penalties for burning without a license are fines equivalent to $ 725 dollars per acre affected and prison sentences of up to one year. But the law is widely flouted. Debt-ridden <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> does n't have enough forest rangers or policemen to make the rules stick, and, besides, most of the jungle burners could n't afford the fines anyway. `` What we would really like is to be able to enforce the law that says a property owner must reforest the area he has destroyed,'' Catanhede says. `` But with only 15 forest guards to keep an eye over more than 90,000 rural properties in the entire state and with no funds to increase our manpower, controlling the burnings becomes an impossible task.'' <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Assis </PERSON> <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, says his office has been trying to educate farmers to plant perennial crops such as coffee, cacao, and rubber, mango and orange trees. `` The land would have to be slashed and burned only once to grow such crops and thus repeated burnings and further destruction would be avoided,'' he says. But homesteaders like <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, who have little or no education and who emigrated from other parts of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> where their lives were even more wretched than in <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION>, say they never received any instructions or guidance from the government. <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION> state government was about to implement an `` agro-ecological zoning plan'' to specify which areas were ecologically suitable for different agricultural activities and cattle raising, thereby protecting, theoretically, the jungle from unnecessary destruction. But he says <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s federal government, facing political opposition because of a record 800 percent annual inflation rate, views efforts to educate farmers about the proper use of the soil as `` superfluous expenditures which just increase the public deficit.''

 As its circulation nears 250,000 after only three issues, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> magazine is receiving poems from Boat People and letters from kids wanting to know more about the war Dad at last is beginning to talk about. `` I would n't be surprised if we started hearing from old <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> cadre telling how they got ready for Tet,'' says <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel and twice-wounded <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who edits the magazine. `` We never know where our readers are, there's such renewed interest in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> everywhere. We've had letters from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> just did a feature on us.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON>, the 31-year publisher of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, was in the 6th grade when the evening TV news showed the Tet battle for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has fascinated him ever since, but he had no idea that the quarterly he launched in March almost on a whim would attract such a readership. By January it will become a bimonthly and expand from 68 to 84 pages, 32 in full color. `` The beer and tobacco advertisers are knocking on the door,'' <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON> says. `` They do n't usually bother with anything under a half-million circulation. It's incredible. The first issue drew 3,000 letters. We touched a sensitive public nerve that had been long suppressed and it exploded. In my wildest dreams I never thought we'd reach sales of 100,000 in two years.'' The magazine hit the newsstands at a time when movies such as `` Platoon'' and `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and TV series such as `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Beach'' and `` Tour of Duty'' were finding an eager audience. `` All of a sudden there is almost a nostalgia for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The vets are breaking out their faded jungle fatigues and boonie hats to march in Veterans Day parades. We get letters recalling how beautiful the beaches were and asking about tours back to Nam,'' says Summers. `` Our mail and reader surveys show that their wives, widows and kids want to learn more about our least-understood war.'' Summers served as an infantry officer in War Zone D and then returned to negotiate with the North Vietnamese. He was evacuated by helicopter from the roof of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> when <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> fell. `` Our aim is to tell what happened, not why, as accurately and dispassionately as possible, without glory or <PERSON> gore </PERSON>. This is not ` Rambo' or ` Soldier of Fortune','' adds <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, who has taught at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, authored several textbooks on military tactics and writes a syndicated column on military affairs. The average age of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans is now 41, and this baby boom generation is beginning to examine its youth. Executive Editor <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> credits the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Memorial with `` encouraging the 2,594,000 veterans who did a tour in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to come out of hiding, rejoin the mainstream and claim the pride that is their due. The memorial has become both their Wailing Wall and the place to meet up with old buddies.'' Since its dedication on Veterans Day 1982, the memorial has become second only to the White House as a magnet for visitors to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The gradual but growing visibility of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans 15 years after the last American units `` stood down'' in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is reflected in the ranks of the American Legion, which now counts 800,000 of them in its 2.3 million membership. This August, for the first time, several hundred <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans turned up in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the annual convention of the Society of the First Infantry Division. There are 77 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

It publishes seven other magazines _ including World War II, American Civil War, Age of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> and Great Battles _ from a quaint colonial building in the historic district of <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> points out that `` a 12 - to 15-year lag in books and articles also occurred after the Civil War, which tore apart the country even more than <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> did Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> published his memoirs in 1875, but it was 1881 before <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> wrote his `` Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government'' and <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s memoirs did n't appear until 1884. In telling the what, rather than the why, of the war, early issues of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> gave graphic accounts of MIG vs. Phantom dogfights over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the battle for Song Be in the <ORGANIZATION> Mekong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, and B-52 raids on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Other articles looked back at `` The <LOCATION> Pentagon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' the command complex at <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s Tan Son Nhut airbase, the huge American-built port at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> now crowded with Soviet warships, and French historian <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fall </PERSON>, who was killed in a mine explosion along Route 1, his `` La Rue Sans Joie'' _ street without joy. `` This war was fought on so many different levels, from lonely jungle outposts and huge bomber bases to tunnel rats and gunboat crews on the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION>, that there is real hunger among our readers to find out what the other guys were doing there and how it all fitted together,'' <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON> says. `` Also we know from the mail there is a lot of interest in the 7,500 women who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and their effect on the expanding role of the female in modern warfare.'' Advertisements at the back of the magazine show a growing market for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> videotapes, insignia, authentic fatigues, infrared goggles and military watches, and a lively competition among collectors of battlefield souvenirs such as <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> bamboo canteens and helmets, authentic `` calico noir'' _ or black pajamas _ even pungi stakes, clay grenades and other guerrilla weaponry. Upcoming issues include a look at how Australian forces operated on jungle patrols, an interview with <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> about his biography of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> guru <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vann </PERSON>, and a step-by-step recounting of how <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> surgeons operating behind a wall of sandbags removed a live grenade from a GI's back. `` We have no shortage of manuscripts,'' Summers says. `` And almost every week somebody offers us 1,000 or so pictures he took out there. We're always willing to have a look, but we stay away from the grisly stuff.'' Despite the continuing avalanche of both, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> does not print poems or letters to the editor. `` But we may review our policy there,'' the editor says. `` A lot of poignant poetry comes from Vietnamese refugees.'' Try as it might to avoid controversy, the magazine wandered into a politcal mine field while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was considering a bill to move the starting date of the undeclared Vietnam War back to Feb. 28, 1961, so more veterans could receive education and pension benefits. Eligibility now dates from Aug. 5, 1964, when President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyers had been attacked in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION>. The Vietnam Memorial commences its long gray granite line of the dead in 1959. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> magazine, in its second issue, moved the date of `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> casualty'' all the way back to Sept. 26, 1945 with an account of the assassination `` by Communist bullets'' of OSS Maj. A <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, who was on a mission `` to locate 214 Americans at two Japanese POW camps in the <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> area.'' Controversies of this sort, <PERSON> Oehler </PERSON> says, `` show how much mystery and confusion still shroud the Vietnam War. If we can shed any valid historic light on any area of this enigma that still baffles the national conscience, the magazine will be worthy of the interest it has generated among a generation that has been so sadly ignored.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ It was less than a decade ago that a federal judge in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> ruled that women in prison were not being afforded education, employment and legal services equivalent to those for men. Since then many prisons have instituted reforms, but not without prodding. Here's what happened at a women's prison in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.

 Women convicted of even minor felonies often enjoy fewer privileges behind bars than men serving time for murder or rape, prison reform advocates say. `` Women prisoners' concerns do not get the priority men's do,'' says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s National Prison Project. `` If they're thought about at all, they're way down the list. They do n't complain about it, so correctional people are not really required to do anything about it.'' The numbers may be one reason. Only about 5 percent of the state and federal prisoners nationwide are women. But buoyed by some court rulings in recent years, female prisoners are beginning to see some changes. In 1983, for example, women at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> wanted a law clinic, a privilege established long ago in men's prisons. Officials denied the request, leading <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> and four other inmates to file a class-action lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The suit also alleged that vocational, educational, medical, rehabilitation and psychological services at <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> were inferior to those at prisons for men. They also claimed exposure to fire hazards and asbestos endangered their safety. `` We decided that maybe it was time to take a look at not only the legal situation, but a lot of other things that we were concerned about _ education, the medical department, the way we were placed in jobs,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, who is serving a life term for killing a man during a bank robbery. Prison reform advocates say the claims are similar to those involving women's prisons in many states. In the landmark <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> case in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON> in 1979 ruled that education, employment and legal services for women prisoners were inferior to those for men. He later ordered a series of improvements in those programs and the creation of a trust fund to benefit female prisoners. The federal <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 warned that such suits would increase as long as female offenders did not have facilities, training or services equivalent to those for male offenders. Reform advocates say advances have been made as the number of women in state and federal prisons has doubled during the 1980s. `` The number increase will ironically increase the numbers of programs,'' says <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, an attorney for the plaintiffs in the <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> case, said, `` My sense is that the <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> decisions have enabled complainants in other states to use the language of the judge and the decisions to bring suits and get things settled.'' At <LOCATION> Muncy </LOCATION>, Miss <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said, the inmates felt rejection of the law clinic was the last straw. `` I decided that it was just time for me to either stand up and be heard or stop complaining and never doing anything about it,'' she said. The lawsuit has not come to trial. But attorneys for both sides say many of the inmates' complaints have been resolved. They now have access to a legal program, a drug and alcohol treatment counselor, a mental health clinic and strengthened vocational and eductional programs. `` Unquestionably, a number of the changes that were made are a direct result of this litigation,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, managing attorney of the Philadelphia-based Women's Law Project, which is co-counsel for the plaintiffs along with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Place </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Dickinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>, nestled in the lush farmland of the <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, today is a prison of stone cottages where inmates can grow vegetables and play softball with teams from nearby towns. They also can qualify as paralegals and learn house painting, upholstery, computers and auto mechanics. <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> administrators speak of a window of opportunity to change the lives of inmates, most of whom are mothers and will leave prison after less than five years. `` They need to be able to leave prison with something in their bag of tricks besides themselves,'' says Superintendent <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goolsby </PERSON>. The path often starts with basic education, and inmates who need it can receive one-on-one tutoring from the staff, outside volunteers and other inmates. The prison was established in 1920 as the State Industrial Home at <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>. It was <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s only state prison for women until July 1, 1984, when a minimum-security women's prison opened at <LOCATION> Waynesburg </LOCATION>. Eleven housing units and 10 other buildings are clustered on <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>'s 62-acre campus.

 Mrs. <PERSON> Goolsby </PERSON> estimates that 70 percent of the 525 inmates were imprisoned for drug-related crimes. They range in age from 18 to 69, with most between 25 and 39. Eighty are lifers. Six are men. `` The history of <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> is very typical of women's prisons,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> says. `` It was built at a time when it was fashionable to believe that the appropriate treatment of women offenders and juvenile offenders was to send them far out into the countryside to obtain fresh air and good healthy work and to remove them from the corrupting influences of the city.'' <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>'s setting in rural <LOCATION> Lycoming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is within a short drive of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Allenwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION>, but it's a four - to five-hour drive from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where most of <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>'s inmates come from The distance became a sex-discrimination issue in the lawsuit, because many men's prisons are closer to major cities where families can visit more easily. `` You can not travel to <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> by public transportation for visiting hours,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> says. `` This is absolutely devastating to women who need to maintain contact with their kids.'' A $ 4,000 contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to provide transportation for children and care-givers is awaiting prison approval, says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, president of Project IM-PACT -LRB- Inside Muncy-Parents and Children Together -RRB-, a new program that provides a homelike setting for inmates to meet with children inside the prison. Apprenticeships, following the example set in federal prisons, were started at <LOCATION> Muncy </LOCATION> in 1979. Inmates can qualify for a license in upholstery, caning and refinishing furniture, auto mechanics, food services and building construction and maintenance. <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Denison </PERSON>, who promoted prison apprenticeships before retiring from the Women's Bureau of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> had an exemplary program that not only offered good training but helped inmates find jobs or further training once they left prison. Two job-placement specialists travel around the state looking for jobs that would be suitable for inmates completing their terms and helping them make the adjustment. The prison this fall will open a power sewing factory which will be part of the prison system's <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, allowing inmates to earn a bonus while learning skills that could help them find jobs outside prison. The suit's complaint that women with psychiatric problems received inadequate treatment has been resolved with the temporary conversion of one cottage into state-certified mental health clinic. An $ 840,000 mental health addition to the prison infirmary is awaiting an architect. The lawsuit's complaints about fire safety and asbestos have met with divergent fates. `` Prisoners at <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> are housed in buildings with antiquated cell-lock systems, requiring that each of 40 to 45 cells be unlocked by hand by the guard on duty in the event of fire or other emergency,'' the suit stated. A $ 1.89 million project to install an electronic locking system, fire detectors, emergency exits and lighting was completed Sept. 25, 1986, says <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, press secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. The project was part of a systemwide improvement in the prisons' Life Safety Code, he said. Still unresolved is the presence of asbestos, a mineral fiber once widely used in building products but now associated with certain types of cancer. Two inspectors hired by the plaintiffs in October 1987 found asbestos-containing materials throughout the institution. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roseman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamstein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said in their report that prison maintenance workers had tried to remove and repair the materials without proper training. On March 8, nearly three months after the inspectors' report was sent to state attorneys, two inmates and two staff maintenance workers were asked to work above and around crumbling asbestos from pipes, according to a court motion filed in April. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> says the department now has contracted with <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> to review the extent of the asbestos problem. Miss <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, interviewed in the formal conference room of the prison administration building, said the suit has not endeared her to all inmates. `` There are those inmates who feel, and maybe rightly so, that we should n't make such a fuss,'' she says.

 <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, artist and bird lover, started a `` revolution'' 60 years ago in the hilly meadows and woods surrounding this small city in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A walk in the woods has n't been the same since. It was here that <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> found the inspiration for an epic work, `` A Field Guide to the Birds,'' a book that revolutionized nature study. It took ornithology out of the laboratory and made the feathered, fanciful world of the treetops more accessible to the common man. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s guidebook is found in more than three million homes and libraries and is considered one of the main reasons 60 million Americans take an interest in birds. More important to <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, it has increased people's awareness of the environment, which he says was his underlying goal. `` Birding, afterformance. During curtain calls, the entire cast showered <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> with red roses. They were assisted by members of the audience, some of them running down the aisles of the Majestic Theater to toss flowers on the stage. An emotional <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> spoke to the theatergoers, choking on what he said was the same thing he told his mother on his 21st birthday. `` I'd like to thank you for having me,'' he told the cheering crowd. `` You're perfection,'' yelled one enthusiastic woman. But <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has not hung up his `` Phantom'' mask and put away his makeup for good. The actor plans to do at least a nine-month engagement, beginning next May, in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> company of `` Phantom.'' It's the best possible audition for the movies. `` The film people are there, and they'd see it,'' he says. `` I have got very strong interest and offers from two studios. If I'm in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, I can work on development as it is happening. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has made movies before. Film buffs know him from `` The Knack,'' `` A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' `` Hello, Dolly!'' and `` How I Won the War.'' But this is the first time a movie will be planned around him. What a difference a hit musical can make to a career. `` I do n't think I was known over here at all,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he was a star. He appeared in several hit British television series and had done three big musicals in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> _ `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>,'' `` Flowers for <PERSON> Algernon </PERSON>'' and `` Barnum.'' The last show, an American musical, had an even longer run in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> than it did in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It ran so long we had births and deaths in the audience,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. `` People died, and we had a woman give birth once. It was like life aboard a 747 on an around-the-world trip.'' `` Phantom'' _ with the help of exposure on national television shows such as `` West 57th Street'' _ has made his face familiar to fans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` When I first opened in ` Phantom' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> even the stage managers would ask, ` Are you <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>?,''' he says. Before he left the show, there were crowds of 50 to 60 people waiting each night at the stage door to see him. And the letters never stopped coming. Every day he would receive more than 100 letters, some from overseas and addressed simply, `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, Broadway, <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s most dedicated followers have been an informal group of Britishers called the OGRES, which stands for Opera Ghosts Return Enthusiasts. Many of them came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for his final Broadway appearance. Some had been here twice before, unfurling banners down the Majestic alleyway that proclaimed `` Bring Him Home.'' `` There are about 25 of them and they wo n't let anyone else join,'' he says. `` They are very exclusive. And if anyone misbehaves, they are out. Or if they bother me. They do n't like to annoy me. They are very good to me.'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> also has widened his appeal with his first solo recording, `` Songs From the Stage and Screen'' that he made before he opened `` Phantom'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They have sold over 200,000 copies on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, so it's on its way to gold,'' he says `` And I'm very pleased. There was a terrific amount of care gone into that record.'' The album, which includes a medley of songs from `` West Side Story'' and such Broadway classics as `` If I Loved You,'' `` Memory'' and `` You'll Never Walk Alone,'' has sold well all over the world. `` It's triple platinum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, which means it has sold 20,000 copies,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> says. `` Even the sheep are buying it.'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> will go back into the recording studio early next year in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to record a second album, this time a collection of love songs. He hopes to include `` Music of the Night,'' his big number from `` Phantom,'' if composer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> grants his permission. The performer also is considering several new Broadway musicals, although none he can talk about. `` But it's nice that I've been asked,'' he says. `` And one of them is of particular interest to me.'' After `` Phantom'' closed, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to make a documentary film for a British charity. Then he may begin to relax for a few weeks. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> admits he'll miss the hoopla that accompanied his 10-month `` Phantom'' run in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, although there are tradeoffs. `` I'll be glad to have it quiet after all that attention,'' he says. `` You need that quiet whenever you have finished a show that is an event.''

 <PERSON> Mart </PERSON> <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> was awestruck when speakers at a conference blessed by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> made the same statements that had landed him in prison, but he said the new freedom had not penetrated Soviet labor camps. <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON>, a dissident for decades who was freed July 8, heard two days of speeches as a guest delegate to an officially sanctioned meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an Estonian nationalist group. `` A lot has changed,'' he said. `` People have become less afraid of publicity. They criticize the authorities boldly. `` People are more frank, open-hearted. National self-consciousness has become very strong. It's surprising for me.'' <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> agreed that fewer people are going to jail for political reasons, but also said the reform program President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls perestroika had not eased the misery of those already there. `` There have been no changes. Perestroika has n't reached the correctional labor camps,'' he said. For <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON>, the memories of arrests and prison are too vivid to permit complete belief in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. He still holds his hand over his mouth when speaking of politically sensitive matters. As a reminder to all, the 54-year-old former inmate wore the black-and-gray striped uniform of `` special regime'' prisoners like himself who are repeat offenders or considered especially dangerous. Speakers at the conference Oct. 1-2 in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s city hall urged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to renounce <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s pact with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> under which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> took control of independent <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> in 1940. `` I was sentenced for that. ... I got 10 years for that,'' <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> said in the excellent English he learned while studying ornithology before he was sent to prison. He and 47 other activists signed an appeal on the 40th anniversary of the agreement, Aug. 23, 1979, demanding its renunciation. He was arrested in April 1980 on charges of `` anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation'' and sentenced to 10 years in prison and five in internal exile. It was <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON>' fourth arrest. He spent eight years in jail in the 1960s. Now even the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is calling for a review of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s foreign and domestic policies. The party also has taken up some of nationalist demands: making Estonian the official language, gaining local control over the republic's economy and curbing immigration of non-Estonians. As a `` special regime'' prisoner, <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> spent most of his time in solitary. He was hospitalized for a month after his release, being treated for chronic back pain that developed because he was forced to sit for long periods and poor eyesight he said resulted from confinement in a small, dark cell. To illustrate the decline of his health, <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> displayed two photographs _ one taken in 1976, before his latest imprisonment, in which he had a full head of black hair and full cheeks; the other taken after his release in July, showing a man with gray, thin hair and sunken cheeks. `` You are not treated as a human'' in special regime, he said. <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> described the standard diet was thin gruel, bread and weak tea with sugar for breakfast; cabbage soup, bread and oatmeal for lunch, except for Sunday when the main course was macaroni, and hot water and a small piece of fish in the evening. Those meager rations may improve, however. On July 25, the Soviet parliament directed that rations for prisoners in solitary confinement or special regime no longer be reduced. Western estimates put the number of Soviet labor camps at more than 1,000 and say they hold at least 1 million people, perhaps twice that. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, says about 200 people now are in labor camps, psychiatric hospitals or internal exile because of political beliefs, compared with 10,000 a few years ago. Soviet officials say all but a few people classified in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as political prisoners were freed by amnesties in February and June 1987. They say the `` anti-Soviet propanganda and agitation'' law under which they and <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> were convicted is being softened in a revision of the criminal code. Perhaps, but <PERSON> Niklus </PERSON> said: `` They may arrest me again now. I have been arrested four times. You never know when they will get you again.'' Then he added, with a slight chuckle: `` But I am not afraid. I have a kind of immunity.''

 A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, pursuing a dream born in <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s time that is coming true at last. Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world. The 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it underwater, will cut the <LOCATION> London-Paris </LOCATION> journey from six hours to three, as fast as a scheduled airline. It will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being shifted to trucks for a cross-channel ferry trip subject to weather and shipping strikes. Tunneling speed at the Dover end is less than 15 feet an hour and the machine boring from the geologically more complex French end moves even slower, which is why the tunnel will not open until 1993. For continental Europeans, accustomed to long-distance rail travel, the tunnel is but a small spur on a vast network stretching to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and beyond. For the British, the change wrought by what many call the `` chunnel'' will be enormous. Some wonder whether <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will be ready for it. `` People still question whether the tunnel will be complete in May 1993 and that's ridiculous,'' says <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, co-author of a book on the project. `` They're still arguing about whether it will introduce rabies into this country, or let in terrorists.'' `` They discuss it in terms of their being an island race, with a channel that has kept out invaders,'' she said in an interview. State-owned British Rail will not commit itself to building a high-speed link from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to the tunnel in time to make the three-hour journey a reality in 1993. It intends instead to improve existing tracks. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Anglo-French </LOCATION> consortium that will own the tunnel, is urging <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> to speed its plans. Critics say the tangle of commuter lines in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, so obsolete that trains can be delayed by a sudden fall of autumn leaves, will delay tunnel traffic. The consortium forecasts 16.5 million passengers in 1993 but the railroad says that figure will not be reached before 1998. Arriving channel trains will terminate at <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> station in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, at a large customs and immigration terminal. Critics say this will waste time and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should follow the continental practice of handling such matters on the train during the journey. British stations, bridges and tunnels are not built for the tall loads commonly carried across the channel. That means many loads will have to be repacked or transferred to trucks unless the facilities are rebuilt. The grandiose project has been on and off the drawing boards for more than 200 years. <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> wanted to bore a tunnel in 1802 but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s generals warned him off. Digging began in 1882 but was halted by British fears of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> invasion through the tunnel. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s entry into the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> engendered a spirit of unity and the digging began again in 1974, but two years later a new British government shelved the project. With trade barriers among the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries set to fall in 1992, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, technical director of <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION>'s on the British side, says the tunnel will be completed this time. He says the entire cost of 5.2 billion pound -LRB- $ 8.8 billion -RRB- project is privately financed and cancellation would cost the governments `` enormous penalties'' to shareholders. Also, the governments signed a tunnel treaty in February 1986 and both would have to agree to cancellation. `` There's no way that politicians will cancel this project,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's quite difficult to get one government to agree. To get two is bloody nigh impossible.'' Money's power to move the tunnel forward was demonstrated in August, when drilling fell behind schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> ordered a management shakeup and threatened Trans-Manche Link, the consortium of 10 British and French engineering companies building the tunnel, with penalties of $ 25 million if the diggers did not pass the three-mile mark by Nov. 1. From a a rate of 380 feet a week, the pace quickly accelerated and recently achieved a week's record of 480 feet, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. The timetable calls for 650 feet a week and <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> is confident of reaching it. The tunnel, 80-130 feet below the seabed, was 2 miles into the channel from this end Oct. 9, the most recent measurement available, and the French had progressed about 1,300 feet. Digging began last December. At its peak, the project will employ about 11,000 workers and 11 tunneling machines. Construction of the two one-way train tunnels begins in December. A smaller service tunnel running between them now is being dug. Tunneling machines simultaneously dig, remove rock and put up tunnel walls. With a laser beam to keep the driver on course, the 700-foot-long behemoth creeps along, pressing curved slabs of Scottish granite and pulverized ash into the newly exposed tunnel wall. In an emergency like flooding, the cylindrical head of the machine can expand to become a cork, blocking off the water and spraying concrete into the cavity to seal the leak. Once the all-clear is given, the two-story-high rotating blade with its tungsten teeth resumes chewing ahead. Because the machines are too large to be removed, when the digging is complete they will be rolled aside and walled in. The tunnels are to be completed in 1991, then the railroad tracks will be laid. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> will run shuttle trains once every three minutes at peak times between terminals near <LOCATION> Folkestone </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and the Frenh state railroad will operate trains from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Cars and trucks will drive onto the shuttle trains and be able to stay in their vehicles or stroll about during the 35-minute tunnel passage.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Clara's Heart,'' ``Imagine: John Lennon''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Clara's Heart'' <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> is a brutally direct woman who colors her human relationships with a good deal of common sense, self-righteousness and tenacity. She also has an overwhelming humanity about her, and that specialness attracts people to her like a magnet. The relationship she forges with young <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> is bound to be a memorable screen joining. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> is a vibrant and rich role, one that could easily turn around <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s dismal film career. After such losers as `` Burglar,'' `` Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and `` Fatal Beauty,'' in which the stand-up comic was required to do little more than imitate <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and be the Butterfly <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON> of the 1980s, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> finally has a chance to demonstrate her talents as a dramatic actress. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> -LRB- `` To Kill a Mockingbird,'' `` Inside Daisy Clover'' -RRB- restrains <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> in his direction of this family melodrama, allowing none of the bits and business that have become the trademarks of her wealth of comic stage characters. That restraint is essential to Clara herself, a Jamaican with a dark secret. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> enters the lives of the affluent <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> family from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION>, shortly after the crib death of their daughter. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> -LRB- MichaelOntkean -RRB- have gone to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to help get over the tragedy. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> is their hotel maid. She coaxes <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> out of her depression and encourages her to get on with life. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> decides to bring her back to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ she ca n't quite function without <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>'s island sensibilities. But son <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> takes an immediate dislike to <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> and accuses his parents _ rightfully so _ of bringing her home so they wo n't have to deal with him. The Harts are in the process of a divorce. He has taken up with a hot cutie, and she has taken up with a pretentious bore of a pop shrink -LRB- Spalding Gray -RRB-. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> eventually wins over <PERSON> David </PERSON> to the point where he'd rather spend his weekends in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> and her West Indian friends than with his parents. He also picks up <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>'s island patois, to the delight of her friends. But <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s dependency on Clara ultimately leads to her dark revelation. And it is here that the movie falters. There is no build-up to this awful experience in her life, and its unfolding is an abrupt twist. And with the tale, there remain loose ends: Letters hidden in a suitcase and found by <PERSON> David </PERSON> are never explained; the father of <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>'s child also is a mystery. Still, `` Clara's Heart'' is a warm movie with many lessons to tell, if one is willing to listen. Its force is aided by <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s performance and a noteworthy movie debut of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as <PERSON> David </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release of an <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> Entertainment Production features a lilting score by <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Grusin </PERSON>. But Hollywood has yet to learn through its endless quest for authenticity that steel music and calypso are products of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, where reggae and soca bloom. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elfand </PERSON> produced `` Clara's Heart,'' which is rated PG-13. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Imagine: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'' Rarely has a 20th-century phenomenon been so thoroughly chronicled in every conceivable way as the Beatles. Yet the new documentary `` Imagine: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'' provides previously unseen material on the most enigmatic of the Beatles, if not any fresh insights. <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s ever-protective widow, released 200 hours of tapes and films from their private collection to documentary and miniseries producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Making of the President: 1960,'' `` Roots'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Wolper </PERSON> and producer-director <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> culled through the material and also searched for newsreels and TV appearances. The documentary material was combined with new interviews with <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s first wife, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON>, sons <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>, and various associates of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. None of the three surviving Beatles was interviewed. `` Imagine'' provides a gold mine for Beatle lovers and especially those who revere <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, who was slain outside his apartment in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> by a crazed fan in 1980. But the film provides marginal entertainment for the average moviegoer. Documentaries are never easy to endure in a theater. `` Imagine'' is no exception, despite the great skill that went into its making. There are some riveting moments. The most scarifying comes when <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> encounter cartoonist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capp </PERSON> -LRB- `` L'il Abner'' -RRB- during the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Bed-in for Peace, a meeting as deadly in its way as a mongoose's minuet with two cobras. The <ORGANIZATION> Lennons </ORGANIZATION>' penchant for shock is demonstrated in a nude love-making scene which was filmed two weeks before he died, intended for a music video. It is antiseptically graphic, hardly erotic at all. Director <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> has capably maintained the kind of pace established in the trend-setting Beatles feature `` A Hard Day's Night. Only in the final sequence does the film falter. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s murder and the outpouring of grief from his candle-holding fans is protracted into a kind of deification that hardly suits the subject There is commentary by family and friends, and <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s own voice narrates much of `` Imagine.'' Whether he was excessively narcissistic or merely had a exceptional sense of history, posterity should be grateful for his extensive record-keeping. How valuable it would be to have such records of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and other icons. The <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release was co-produced by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> and written by <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>. Rated R for nudity and language.

 `` Talk Is Cheap'' -LRB- Island -RRB- _ <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> If <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s solo records are <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> without the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION>, conversely, and somewhat symmetrically, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' first solo effort is the Stones without <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> is n't much of a singer, but he manages a listenable rasp on a series of tunes that would n't exactly tax <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>. This is a tough rock musicians' record, anyway, starting with <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' patented take-no-prisoners guitar backed by a stellar cast of studio musicians, including <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrell </PERSON> on organ, <PERSON> Waddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> -LRB- former Stone -RRB- on guitars, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON> and <PERSON> Macco </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> on various saxes, plus the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horns </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Drayton </PERSON> is on bass most of the time, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> drums and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> keyboards. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON> sings background. <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Scialfa </PERSON> -LRB- E Street Band and the Boss' main squeeze -RRB- is on one cut. All the songs were co-written by <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` Take It Hard'' and `` Struggle'' are especially worth blasting loud enough to enrage the neighbors. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> makes a mistake on `` Make No Mistake'' with his impersonation of <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> on steroids. Dash comes in to save it, though, giving <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> a Tom Waits-like charm by comparison. They team again on the wonderfully soulful `` Rockawhile.'' `` Locked Away'' is a real pretty tune. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> should hire someone else to sing it. By the last cut, `` It Means a Lot,'' it seems <PERSON> Richards-Jordan </PERSON> had run out of ideas. But the closer of Side 1, `` You Do n't Move Me,'' is another four-star effort that could apply to anyone you know who needs a verbal thrashing but here, it was obviously meant for <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>: `` You lost the feeling, got so appealing. Why do you think you think you got no friends? You drove'em all ` round the bend Ah, yeah, you do n't move me anymore. ... It's no longer funny, it's bigger than money, you just do n't move me anymore.'' As the record says, `` Talk Is Cheap,'' so you better be able to move'em yourself. And most of the time <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> does, with room to spare. _ By <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Tighten Up Vol. 88'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Big Audio Dynamite <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, once the fiery guitarist of punk heroes The Clash, now seems a little like a roguish older brother. He lectures a lot, mostly about respecting the rights of others. His music, once loud and brash, is more melodic and _ dare we say _ nearly laid back. The cover of his group's new album shows him dressed in a tuxedo, although with a lipstick stain on his face and clutching a wine bottle. Big Audio Dynamite's first album a few years back was an exciting synthesis of rock and urban rhythms, mixed in with the `` found sounds'' of old movie clips. The second album was a less exciting take on the same idea. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and his usual writing partner, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Letts </PERSON>, are neither melodically adventurous nor particularly good singers, so many B.A.D. songs tend to sound the same. The group needed to stretch out a bit, and for the most part do it successfully on `` Tighten Up Vol. 88'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' old group wanted to save the world, now the ambitions are scaled back. `` No one gets 10 out of 10,'' he sings on `` Other 99,'' `` You got ta strive for five.'' In `` Funny Names,'' he sings, `` You're not like me. I'm not like you. Do n't mean we ca n't get along.'' Their utopian outlook would sound naive if it was n't so good-natured. B.A.D. does n't take itself too seriously, unlike the Clash. One of the best songs here, `` Just Play Music,'' rejects rock star trappings and suggests good music is really quite simple. That's not just a lyrical approach. B.A.D. uses some familiar <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> riffs, borrows from the old standard `` Battle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>'' and generally goes for straightforward rock on this album. But many of the songs are sweetened by synthesizers and few have a particularly hard edge. Big Audio Dynamite can consider this a rebound from the sophomore slump. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Hot Water'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> There was a time when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> sang cleverly, and sometimes even movingly, about everything from life, love and loneliness to cheeseburgers, gas station robberies and the sea. That was more than a decade ago now, before <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> began a long, sad slide that finds him, again, in `` Hot Water,'' desperately trying to breathe life into the cliche that he has become, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Official Tropical Hedonist. The new LP is cruise-line predictable. He softly sings the praises of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> air -LRB- or, as he affectedly sings en francais, `` L'Air de la Louisiane'' -RRB- _ only a dozen years after he sang the same song about `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>,'' one state away. Here comes the `` Prince of Tides.'' There goes the `` King of Somewhere Hot.'' This is n't rock' n' roll; this is the Weather Channel. Musically, things are little better. There's an all-star guest list _ <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Winwood </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Neville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, even <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ but what you hear here, mon, is the misplaced sound of steel drums. And if the pseudo-Caribbean schtick were n't wearing thin by now, `` Hot Water'' finds <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> pretentious _ three of these songs begin with spoken soliloquies _ and mean-spirited. When he's not complaining that his songs are n't on the radio, he's bordering on misogyny: complaining that `` baby's gone shopping'' when she ought to stay home, forsaking `` bimbo limbo'' to search for a `` smart woman in a real short skirt.'' <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>'s magic with his audience has been that they wished they could live their lives like his songs. Songs like these make it hard to remember why anyone ever felt that way. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' autobiography, `` The Ragman's Son,'' has spent weeks on non-fiction best-seller lists, a position generally accorded such female stars as <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> How did <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> make the magic list when other actors have failed? The secret may be that his book is just as frank, intense and combative as the public's image of <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> over the past four decades. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> has never walked away from a fight. Many a producer, director and co-star can recall scars acquired in encounters with <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. He turned his back on a seven-year contract from <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> at a time when most actors would grab it. He defied the industry powers by hiring the blacklisted <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumbo </PERSON> to write `` Spartacus.'' As revealed in `` The Ragman's Son,'' he romanced a wide range of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s glamour queens, including <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sothern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> seems to be a man who got everything he wanted. But he had two great frustrations. He was madly in love with <PERSON> Pier </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeli </PERSON>, but despite their engagement, he could never escape her ever-present parents. He starred in `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' on Broadway but could never make a movie deal He became too old for the role, and son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> co-produced the film, which won an Academy Award for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a vigorous 69, recently reminisced about his life and times at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> offices of <PERSON> Bryna </PERSON> <PERSON> Productions </PERSON>, named for his mother. He told of the inception of his autobiography. `` I was driving to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> one day, and I saw a sailor hitchhiking. I had been in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, so I picked him up. When he got in the car, he looked at me and said, ` Do you know who you are?' `` Well, I thought about that, and it's an interesting question,'' he said. The actor's search for <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> led him to <PERSON> Issur </PERSON> <PERSON> Danielovitch </PERSON>, the son of illiterate, Russian-Jewish immigrants in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, N.Y. The father was a cold, distant, brawling alcoholic whose love neither Issur nor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> could achieve. `` It's a terrible thing for a young kid who has a father who's so physically strong,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> `` You think, ` My God, I can never be that strong, I can never be that big.' My father was a rag man, yet to me he was somebody. So living with my six sisters and my mother, I had no identity. `` When my father left, I thought, ` Why am I not with my father? I'm a boy! Why am I with the women?''' Young <PERSON> Issur </PERSON> escaped the `` suffocating'' female atmosphere to attend <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, and he never went home again, except for brief visits. He discovered acting in college, went on to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where his looks _ like carved granite _ and intense style attracted <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> offers. And he went on his own terms. `` From the very beginning, I was always independent, a maverick,'' he remarked. `` I did n't belong to any studio. There were good things about that, but there were bad things, too. It was lonely. Everybody else belonged to studios, and they were going to singing and dancing lessons. `` There were a lot of good things to be said for the oldtime studio system that I did not belong to. They developed stars and got parts for them in movies. I was n't part of that. I was sort of outside.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' film career has been marked by an affinity for forceful heroic roles, from his part as a calculating boxer in 1949's `` Champion'' to his depiction of <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> in 1956's `` Lust for Life. Both films earned him Academy Award nominations. In `` Spartacus,'' perhaps <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' greatest role, he starred as the leader of slaves rebelling against Republican <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. At the same time, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> has shown a flair for the comic, especially as a sharp-tongued inmate in the 1970 movie `` There Was a Crooked Man.'' His first film role came in 1946's `` The Strange Love of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivers </PERSON>,'' and his last appearance was in the 1987 NBC production of `` Inherit the Wind.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> has been known for his frankness, and he had these evaluations about some of his friends and colleagues: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>: `` One of the most remarkable men I ever worked with. We never got along, though we did four pictures together. Politically we were complete opposites.'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>: `` I like <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>. He's quite different; for example, he's a great lover of music and opera. Most people would never expect that of <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>. If I ever need <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, I call him; if he needs me, he calls me. It's a wonderful relationship.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanwyck </PERSON> -LRB- who starred in his first film -RRB-: `` She was pretty tough with me at first. I was new, did n't know anybody, and she sort of ignored me for two weeks. But I always forgive any slights like that when I see talent and a professional attitude.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>: `` Never my kind of guy. I always kidded him about those stories he'd tell about being a hobo; they seemed to change every time he told them. But obviously he is a talented guy, and listen, he's had a tremendous career.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>: `` The nicest thing I can say about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is what I put in a note some time ago; he told me it's the only note of mine he has kept. I said to him, ` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, I'm more proud of how you handle your success than I am of your success.' And I think we'll still be hearing a lot from him.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> ... <PERSON> Issur </PERSON> <PERSON> Danielovitch </PERSON>, the ragman's son. I've taken 450 pages to try to explain who I am. And I'm not sure I know yet. `` The best way to sum it up would be in the character of <PERSON> McMurphy </PERSON> in ` One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,' the role I so desperately wanted to play on the screen. <PERSON> McMurphy </PERSON> tries to lift this piece of machinery and fails. They're all looking and feeling sorry for him. He turns to face them and says, ` But I tried. Dammit, I tried.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: International Applause for Opera in English</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lights go up on `` Carmen'' to reveal an extravagantly gaudy junkyard that owes as much to `` West Side Story'' as it does to the fiery passions of composer <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Bizet </PERSON>. Another night sees <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` Tosca'' updated to the fascist <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> of World War II and performed on a tilted stage. The two productions are the season openers at the English National Opera, a company that is making an international name for itself not only on the strength of its singing but for its imaginative stagings. Launched by <PERSON> Lilian </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylis </PERSON> as the <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s Wells Opera in 1931, the company moved to its present home, the 2,358-seat <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Coliseum, in 1968. It changed its name to the English National Opera in 1974, and has since gathered a burgeoning reputation for productions that prize the work over individual stars, and artistic vision over vanity vehicles. `` We are a theater and not a museum,'' music director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Theater needs to be exploratory, renewing, inquisitive. ... It's not just a matter of doing the old classics in a sensationalistic way.'' Indeed not. For although the <ORGANIZATION> ENO </ORGANIZATION> has launched its 21st season at the Coliseum with two warhorses, `` Tosca'' and `` Carmen,'' the breadth of its repertory also includes Broadway musicals, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s `` Pacific Overtures'' and commissioned British works, such as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>'s `` The Plumber's Gift.'' Nov. 9 sees the European premiere of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Making of the Representative for Planet 8,'' the American composer's first work at the ENO since `` Akhnaten'' in 1985. In December, <PERSON> ENO </PERSON> mounts the first professional British staging of <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimsky-Korsakov </PERSON>'s 1895 `` Christmas Eve. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> ENO </ORGANIZATION> will have the British debut of <PERSON> Aribert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reimann </PERSON>'s `` Lear,'' based on the Shakespeare tragedy. It's the same eclectic mix of the tested and the untried that has wrought what <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> called `` a revolution in the standard of theater being offered to opera-goers.'' `` I take for granted that ENO is the reference point of adventurous, living music theater,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, the company's artistic director. `` Opera took a long time to be accepted as essential in British life. ... We've done a certain amount to help that.'' The ENO is responsible for 46 percent of the annual operatic activity in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. During its 10-month 1988-89 season, the company will present 204 performances of 18 operas in what <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> calls `` one of the heaviest repertory systems in the world.'' Production costs range from $ 33,500 to $ 295,000. The upper figure is about half the cost of the most expensive productions at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Covent Garden, the <ORGANIZATION> ENO </ORGANIZATION>'s principal <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> rival. In 1984, the company toured five <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, winning raves from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with works ranging from <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s 1851 `` Rigoletto,'' transplanted to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> a century later, to <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britten </PERSON>'s patriotic 1953 `` Gloriana. The company's white-tie-and-tails version of `` The Mikado'' was to be broadcast by PBS in late October. In spring 1990, plans are in the works to perform a Czech opera and <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>'s 1949 `` Street Scene'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Wherever the ENO appears, one constant remains: It presents all foreign-language operas in English translations, whether it's Prokofiev or <LOCATION> Puccini </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> or <PERSON> Massenet </PERSON> `` What is missing is the texture of the original language,'' said British soprano <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Barstow </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION> understands the policy, even if she did n't always agree with it: `` The fact that the ENO always does perform in English is one reason why the audience has such a high level of concentration. Nowhere in the world have I personally encountered such concentration. Audiences come to listen and to think.'' She said it proved useful to performers, too. `` It's an enormous advantage to young singers to sing a major role like Salome in their own language,'' said <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION>, who first sang <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' vengeful heroine for the <ORGANIZATION> ENO </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. `` It's quite easy to learn opera in a language you speak reasonably well. Familiar works fuel the debate. A new production of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` La Traviata'' won mixed reviews both for peculiarities of its staging and lapses in translation. But earlier stagings in English of <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>'s lesser-known `` Lady Macbeth of <LOCATION> Mtsensk </LOCATION>'' and <PERSON> Leos </PERSON> <PERSON> Janacek </PERSON>'s `` The Makropolous Case,'' both starring <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION>, helped secure those operas' exalted positions within the world repertory In November, <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION> travels to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> to sing `` Lady Macbeth'' for the first time in Russian, which she might never have done had she not attempted it first in English. `` I've tried out a lot of roles with the ENO before I've done them elsewhere,'' said <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION>. She is one of several singers who has reached international status through the ENO. Others include <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Felicity </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>. In September, she appeared as a soloist in <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Ninth Symphony under the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>. In 1989-90, she is scheduled to sing the Marschallin in <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' `` Der Rosenkavalier'' at the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Grand Opera. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> is pleased that alumni-turned-stars more often than not return to their roots: `` You do pinch yourself and think, ` Oh he's lost to us.' But quite a few come back in very favorable positions.'' `` I suppose I'm one of the most loyal ones, if you like,'' said <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION>, who acknowledges the ENO as home base. `` It's comforting to feel you belong somewhere in the whole big world of opera.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Marti Jones Wants a Part of the World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> does n't want to take over the whole world, just a small part. `` I do n't have that drive to want to be this huge superstar because I'm just having fun doing what I'm doing,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whose third album, `` Used Guitars,'' was released this summer. `` But I'd be stupid not to notice when people hear the record on the radio, they go out and buy it. I can go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and play halls, fill 1,400-seat halls. Other places, with no airplay, you get maybe 50 people saying ` Who is she?''' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has slowly accumulated a following over the last few years, earning praise for interprations of songs by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, and for the original material created by herself and producer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. It's tempting to define <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> as a `` Critics' Choice,'' someone who receives good reviews but does n't sell many records. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> would like to be successful both artistically and commercially, not just for herself, but for the songwriters she covers. That spirit came out this summer at a concert at the `` Bottom Line'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> brought out many of the songwriters featured on `` Used Guitars.'' Those appearing included <PERSON> Hiatt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and the team of <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kye </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who wrote two songs on the new record. `` We had so much fun,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> recalled. `` Everybody tossed their egos out the door. Everybody rooted for everybody else. Nobody complained about having enough time. `` Nobody got paid. We covered their expenses for traveling and that was it. What a bunch of pals. It was just the whole spirit of the thing. It was like ` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s Cavalcade of Stars.' Everybody does their best five songs.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who still lives in her native <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, grew up in the 1960s hearing a wide variety of music. `` My parents had <PERSON> Burl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ives </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trio </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` My sisters listened to Top 40, the Beatles, Temptations and <ORGANIZATION> Supremes </ORGANIZATION>. Later, I went into the heavy <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> scene, but at the same time I'd take out a <LOCATION> Jimi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hendrix </LOCATION> record and put it on.'' She began singing at an early age and idolized the late country legend <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' own vocals can best be compared to the British singer, <LOCATION> Dusty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` I started reading reviews and they kept saying, ` <ORGANIZATION> Dusty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dusty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>.' and I thought, ` What does she sound like?' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> had this compilation of British hits and we listened to it and I went, ` They're right.' I'm really flattered. She's a great singer. It was eerie.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was in her first band, `` Color Me Gone,'' when she met <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, now her husband and also producer of R.E.M. `` Somebody had the brilliant idea to re-record two of the six songs on the album,'' she said, rolling her eyes. `` We had already done them 20 million times in 20 million ways. `` They flew in <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> as a candidate for a producer. I really liked him. He was a nice guy. He had this attitude that nothing's a big deal. Great attitude.'' After <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> left the group, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> got in touch with her. `` He said, ` I caught your name at the bottom of my drawer and I always liked your singing, what are you planning on doing?' The record label put the two of us together.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> credits <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> with helping develop her own sound. `` I was n't sure what my sound was as a singer because I had been singing songs that were not really the kind I wanted to sing,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` He helped me pick out songs and built my confidence up.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' first album, `` Unsophisticated Time,'' came out in 1984 and has set the tone for her career so far: original songs and covers; good reviews and poor sales. `` The record company did n't push the record. They thought it sounded like a demo,'' she said. `` Match Game,'' released in 1986, continued the pattern. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> combined original songs with covers of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON> among others. `` Used Guitars'' has 11 songs, three of them Dixon-Jones originals. The songs range from `` Ruby,'' a bluesy ballad written by <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, to the mainstream pop of `` Tourist Town,'' a Dixon-Jones composition. The creative process of `` covering'' a song can be compared to an actor reading a script _ taking words written by someone else and turning them into the artist's own personal experience. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is n't concerned about how many of her own songs are put on each album. She believes in using the best material possible, no matter who wrote it. `` Hopefully, people are opening up a little more to realizing a song is a song and it does n't matter if the person's who's singing it, wrote it,'' she said. `` I could write an album's worth of material in two weeks but I do n't think it would be good enough.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Striving for Perfection Is Not Perfectly Normal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> makes $ 250,000 a year working for <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> and prides herself on being `` a shark.'' <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> runs miles every day but has been bulimic for eight years. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> has made straight A's all her life but panics and overprepares for every test. What all these women have in common, says <PERSON> Colette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>, is an overwhelming desire to achieve perfection. In her book `` Perfect Women'' -LRB- Summit, $ 18.95 -RRB-, <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> argues that this striving for ever-higher goals _ hours of aerobics every day, 60-hour work weeks, making every meal from scratch _ is not a healthy exercise to fulfill one's potential but a desperate scramble to fill an inner void. `` An artistic drive is satisfying. A drive to perform is not. ... It's a kind of rigid, compulsive _ kind of a symptom, as compared to something that's really joyful and self-expressive and gives back to us,'' the author said. <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>, best known for her 1981 best seller `` The Cinderella Complex,'' recently talked about her new book in an interview at her publisher's office. `` The whole drive to be perfect comes out of a feeling of inferiority,'' she said. `` We would n't even be interested in the idea of perfection if there was n't something that we psychologically were compensating for.'' Asked why she thinks this striving for perfection is unique to women, <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> said, `` Women as an entire gender have been disparaged culturally for eons, and it's a particular kind of gender feeling about self that gets handed down from the mother to the daughter. `` And now that there's so much opportunity available to women, I think we've just stepped into a new kind of performance arena. I think we're using our achievements to bolster our self-esteem, in the way we used to use our appearance or our cooking or our housekeeping skills or whatever.'' She cites a litany of symptoms from which these overachievers suffer: anorexia and bulimia; drug and alcohol problems; compulsive shopping. All except the drug and alcohol abuse are overwhelmingly female problems. The premise of the `` Cinderella Complex'' was that women had a deep-seated belief that they could not take care of themselves, that despite the gains of the women's movement they were still waiting for a Prince Charming to whisk them off to happily ever after. <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>, 50, said that work was based on her own experience. In the 1970s, after ending a 9-year-marriage to an alcoholic, she moved in with a man she still lives with in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. There, <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>, who had supported herself and her three children as a free-lance writer, abandoned her career and became a full-time housewife. Her partner's refusal to accept her dependency, as well as the therapy she was undergoing, gave her the initiative to write `` The Cinderella Complex.'' `` Perfect Women'' is similarly based on <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>'s personal experience. The author found that despite the success of `` The Cinderella Complex'' -LRB- 26 weeks on the best-seller list -RRB- she still felt insecure about her work and at a loss for her next project. At the same time, her eldest daughter, <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>, a star scholar, athlete and beauty, dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and revealed that she had been bulimic for years. <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> realized that her own relentless drive for success _ so she could like herself _ had been passed down to her daughter. In `` Perfect Women,'' Dowling cites psychological studies detailing the mother-daughter relationship that starts at the crib. `` They -LRB- mothers -RRB- are not overly involved with us -LRB- daughters -RRB- as separate persons; they're overly involved with us as extensions of themselves,'' <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> said. `` This sticky kind of bonding is very unique to the mother-daughter relationship. This is not to say boys do n't have their own problems, because God knows they do, but this is something very specific to the gender.'' The way for a woman to get off the perfection treadmill, she said, is to psychologically separate herself from her mother, which can be done through therapy, self-exploration, perhaps confrontation. `` Perfect Women'' suffers from the kind of generalized prescription that most self-help books offer, but if it makes a few self-improvement junkies stop buying these kinds of pop psychology books and learn to accept themselves as they are, then it's done its work.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Charlie Daniels And His Hard Driving Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Firebrand fiddler <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> called the devil a nasty name in his million-selling record, `` The Devil Went Down to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>.'' He also told the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> where they could go in his song, `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' His new album, `` Homesick Heroes,'' is less polemical and contains music that best portrays his band's style. `` It's what we are,'' he said. `` Hard driving music.'' The rollicking album is the 18th in 17 years for the irrepressible five-piece rock-country band that has performed in all 50 states and several foreign countries. In it, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> plays a blazing fiddle to the flash point in `` Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues,'' a hit single. He plays rousing guitar licks on other songs, and sings sassy, gritty vocals on still others. The LP is a turn away from his last album, `` Powder Keg,'' which he described as the most rock-oriented LP he has recorded. `` It did n't do too well at all,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's still selling, but it never really got off the ground.'' `` It was time for a change. The new album is a career move.'' Country fans will welcome the sound from the `` kingfish of Southern roots music'' whose traditional garb is a huge bullrider cowboy hat, cowboy boots, jeans and vest. He and his band are best known for their Grammy-winning 1980 hit, `` The Devil Went Down to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>,'' the story of a feverish fiddle contest between the devil and a boy named <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> in which he called the devil a mild obscenity. The single sold 1.6 million copies and the `` Million Mile Reflections'' album that contained it sold 2.3 million. `` It had mass appeal,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said about the song. `` I guess the lyrics of the song were responsible for 70-75 percent of the popularity and the fiddle and the novelty value had a lot to do with it.'' The blunt lyrics in that song were similar to the ones in his `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' in which he issued his memorable directive to the Soviets amid a burst of American pride. On topical subjects, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>' `` American Farmer'' focused on the plight of agriculture in the mid-1980s. `` Still in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'' was about a former soldier haunted by his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> experience. Other songs by the band, such as `` Long Haired Country Boy'' and `` Uneasy Rider,'' are more satirical. `` I poke fun at rednecks, hippies, politicians, all kinds of people,'' said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The band traveled 75,000 miles last year, making 116 concert stops. In 1986, they grossed nearly $ 14 million and drew more than 750,000 paid admissions. Amid all the travel and hit records, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> has done a little acting. He was in `` Murder, She Wrote'' and `` Lone Star Kid'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He and the band were featured in the movie, `` Urban Cowboy,'' and their `` Stroker's Theme'' was the title track for <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' movie `` Stroker Ace.'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>' writing has not been restricted to songs. In 1985, he wrote a book of short stories, `` The Devil Went Down to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said one of his proudest achievements has been keeping his band members together so long. Three members have been with him at least 14 years. `` It seems like I've had Taz -LRB- <PERSON> DiGregorio </PERSON>, his keyboard player -RRB- since two days after he was born,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` We're sincere,'' he said about the band's success and its togetherness. `` I keep a 12-month payroll. We have the philosophy that we do the best we can all the time. We get to stretch out some as musicians. Everybody gets to use their ideas and share in the songwriting royalties. I try to treat people well and look after our folks. `` We try real hard,'' he said. `` I want to do the best I can do: cut every record the best, write every song the best, do every show the best, have the most efficient organization in the music business. `` I want the deejays to pick up a <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> record and say, ` Here's a record by the <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> and I want to play this.' `` Quality. You ca n't beat it.''

<TEXT>
 A Mexican mite is being tested against the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> potato beetle that also devastates tomatoes and eggplants. A Chinese wasp may stop a butterfly that eats broccoli, cabbage and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts. Humans increasingly have allies in the enemy camp in the war on insects. Biological controls like these and others using insects against problem plants have been used commercially for more than 100 years, racking up hundreds of successes. In the last 10 years, though, interest has grown. Last year, for example, the federal government spent more than $ 85 million on nearly 800 biological control projects, four times the number in existence a decade ago, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cate </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are now just getting back into an era where entomologists are realizing you ca n't solve the problem with pesticides alone,' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>, who has worked more than 50 years on pest controls. `` For a long time there were advocates of the sole use of each one. Now I think you'll find almost everybody agrees you need a little of each.'' `` There are many different crop pests that have been serious and are not serious because they have been able to find biological controls,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> entomologist working on potato beetles. The mites, <PERSON> Chrysomelobia </PERSON> lapidomerae Eickwort, live on adult beetles and suck fluid from them. Up to 2,000 can infest each beetle. They can shorten the beetles' lifespans up to 50 percent, reducing the number of eggs laid, and they hinder the beetles' flying ability, reducing migration, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> researchers are studying a \ - inch wasp from northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> named Apanteles rubecula, which inserts its tiny needle into a cabbage butterfly larva and lays The wasp larvae eat the pest. The wasps have flourished in a patch of collard greens in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and have attacked an estimated 40 percent of the butterfly larvae in the field, said entomologist <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreische </PERSON>. The needles are too small to hurt humans. Most insects became pests after their natural environments were upset, letting them run rampant. Others were accidentally imported on vegetables and plants to areas where they had no natural predators. Biological controls seek to restore nature's balance. `` It's a totally natural way to regulate -LRB- pest -RRB- populations,'' said <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>, 72, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't pollute, it does n't cost anything if it works, it's self-regulating and self-correcting. Still, biological controls are n't always sucessful, and can be virtually ineffective as with the gypsy moth. The gypsy moth escaped from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> researcher in 1882 as he was trying to cross it with a silkworm to make stronger silk. It feeds on oak trees and occassionally neighborhood rose gardens, but is n't a problem in its native <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where more than 100 insects prey upon it, <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON> said. In this country, it `` can make a forest look like winter in June,'' sad <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> ODell </PERSON>, a research entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. This year the moth ravaged areas of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> From 1905 to 1911, researchers brought 2 million species of the moth's natural enemies from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>. But the effort failed because, `` in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> there are a large number of natural enemies, each of which controls a small number'' of the moths. Of the 127 species introduced against the moth, only eight have survived in this country, said <PERSON> ODell </PERSON>. `` It's not like some of the other pests where we've been able to to find a single natural enemy that regulates it,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. One of 225 successful uses of biological controls was against the <ORGANIZATION> Cottony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cushiony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scale </ORGANIZATION>, which almost wiped out the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> citrus industry after it was inadvertently brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1880s, said <PERSON> Cate </PERSON>, who is also a researcher at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> entomologist brought the <LOCATION> Vendalia </LOCATION> beetle, a type of ladybug and a natural enemy of the scale, from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>. That worked until after World War II, when DDT killed off the beetle. In fact, many pests became a problem when pesticides killed their natural enemies, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. But pesticides can also be ineffective because the harmful insects develop a tolerance to the chemicals, and development ca n't keep up. `` It costs several million dollars to formulate a new material _ to develop it, test it. It's very slow, very expensive,'' he said. The introduction of biological controls also is slow. Despite the growth in the number of projects over the past decade, the level of federal funding has stayed relatively stable when adjusted for inflation, <PERSON> Cates </PERSON> said. Also, scientists face delays while they work to show the government that their controls are harmless to all but the pest. The Mexican mite, being tested at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>, was quarantined for six months before scientists could prove it was a species known in this country. Then the government required tests to show it would not harm beneficial insects like ladybugs or honeybees. It took seven years from the time the mite was found until it was approved. Reassuringly, `` There just have n't been any notable examples of anything going wrong with this process,'' said <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>. Biological controls also may be victims of their own success. When they work `` people forget they had a problem,'' said <PERSON> Cate </PERSON>. `` You solve the pest problem and you walk away from it.'' Companies that invest huge sums in research, `` want a return on their investment,'' said <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>. `` Nobody is going to make any money off importing exotic insects,'' <PERSON> Cate </PERSON> said. As a result, smaller, isolated pests, like the potato beetle, are often overlooked by the large chemical companies.

<HEAD>Japanese Doctors Shy From Giving Cancer Patients Details</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Almost 200,000 Japanese died last year of cancer, most without knowing they had it _ unless they figured it out themselves. Their doctors had n't told them the truth. Traditionally, the Japanese have been unlikely to question the authority of the medical profession, but that appears to be changing as a well-educated people want to know more about what ails them. And doctors are thinking about revising their ethics, which have been based on the belief that patients are depressed if told they have cancer, and will die happier if they do n't know. `` I guess about 90 percent of the doctors still do n't tell,'' said <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>, professor of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Kyoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. But to <PERSON> Jinro </PERSON> <PERSON> Itami </PERSON>, cancer specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Shibata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Okayama </LOCATION>, the real issue is not the propriety of informing patients but how to reduce their fear of death and increase their `` fighting spirit.'' <LOCATION> Itami </LOCATION> four years ago founded a patient-support program called Meaningful Life Therapy. Seven of his patients attempted a morale-building climb of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanc </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> last summer, and three of them reached the summit. `` The earlier patients know about their condition, the better off they are,'' he said, adding that witholding information can create fear and sorrow and delay recovery. The debate, of course, is not limited to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Soviet doctors generally avoid telling a patient directly, according to Dr. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Napalkov </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, doctors tend toward disclosure, said Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Itami </PERSON> said it is almost impossible to keep patients ignorant as they hear about the disease and its treatments everywhere. But even he says that unless patients are ready for the worst, telling them will only cause depression. Instead, he guides them to want to know about their illness and its treatment. `` It is very important for patients to know about their own lives and their condition,'' he said. The public seems to agree. About 60 percent want doctors to tell them even if there is no hope of recovery, according to a poll of 5,608 adults a year ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese national daily. If the disease is likely to be cured, 78 percent want to know. A separate poll of 500 doctors showed 76 percent would not tell the patient if the condition is hopeless. `` It should be us patients, not doctors, that decide how to live the days left in front of us,'' said <PERSON> Haruyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, a 37-year-old free-lance writer who had a breast cancer operation in April. `` Doctors should tell us so that we do n't have to waste time being scared because of ignorance.'' She complained that her doctor had not told her the side effect of a hormonal medicine she took after surgery. She was shocked when her menstruation became irregular, thinking something else was wrong with her. <PERSON> Toshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Murase </PERSON>, pediatrician and executive member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s board of trustees, said it's important to respect the patient's right to know but satisfying the right to know is a different story. `` Some patients might be able to end their lives happier without knowing everything,'' he said, adding that Japanese doctors' most important task is to help reduce their patients' physical pain. There never has been a court ruling in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over the issue of a patient's right to know, said lawyer <PERSON> Katsuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotta </PERSON>, who recently was named to a committee to examine the issue for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association has decided to investigate medical, moral and legal aspects of medical treatment, and appointed 10 people from various professions to talk about `` explanation and consent.'' The group includes novelist <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> <PERSON> Sono </PERSON>; the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>; philosopher <PERSON> Yujiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> and professors of medicine. Cancer is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s No. 1 killer disease, causing 26.6 percent of all deaths last year, with stomach cancer topping the list.

 A Mexican mite is being tested against the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> potato beetle that also devastates tomatoes and eggplants. A Chinese wasp may stop a butterfly that eats broccoli, cabbage and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts. Humans increasingly have allies in the enemy camp in the war on insects. Biological controls like these and others using insects against problem plants have been used commercially for more than 100 years, racking up hundreds of successes.

 There are no dangling icicles in <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, no frost on the walls, and breathing does n't produce vapor clouds. But it's still one of the coldest known spots in the universe. `` It does n't look very impressive but we are going to go a million times colder than the coldest natural place we know of,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, head of the low-temperature physics group at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Microkelvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his colleagues, using a $ 1.5 million super-refrigeration unit, will try to achieve absolute zero _ the temperature at which even atoms stop rubbing together and creating heat. `` We think we can take it down to between 1 and 10 microkelvin,'' he said. `` And each step of the way, we could be finding new effects.'' The only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deep-freeze laboratory is under construction at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. Labs in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> have hit 12 microkelvin. How cold is that? The temperature of deep space, minus 270 degrees Fahrenheit, is only 3 on the <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON> scale, which uses absolute zero for a reference point. Absolute zero in Fahrenheit is minus 459 degrees, while room temperature would be 293 <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON>. A millikelvin is a thousandth of a <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON>, so a microkelvin is a millionth. Dropping from 12 microkelvin to 10 microkelvin might seem inconsequential, but <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> adds this perspective: `` If you increased room temperature by the same ratio, everything would melt or disintegrate.'' The researchers are n't simply out to break records, though. `` The importance of this type of research lies in realizing the strange things that happen at low temperatures,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oosterhuis </PERSON>, section head of the condensed matter sciences unit at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` One just never knows what's going to happen This research provides us with a probe into an area where we've never been before.'' Among the strange discoveries of extremely low-temperature research has been superconductivity _ electricity with no loss to resistance _ at 4 <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON>. `` Sometimes it is the arithmetic or the theory behind the research that has the practical application,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebenberg </PERSON>, who helped the lab get <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> funding before he left in April for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sometimes the technology produced has broader applications in other fields. The most important aspect, though, is that these facilities will be breeding grounds of technological spinoffs for future low temperature research,'' <PERSON> Liebenberg </PERSON> said. Individual scientists have conducted low temperature research before, but the lack of a permanent facility to maintain such temperatures indefinitely and allow for varied experiments has been an obstacle, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` Now we have an adequate tool to find _ or at least search properly _ for the answers to all the open questions that remain in front of us.'' The rooms adjoining <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,800-square-foot underground laboratory are designed to eliminate all stray heat, including that produced from the most minute vibrations and from radio-frequency electrical signals. To that end, they are lined with butcher block wood and galvanized electromagnetic shielding and have specially grounded electrical wiring and incandescent lighting. The low temperature instruments are secured by concrete sewer pipes filled with sand. The supercooling machines themselves are rigid aluminum, filled with liquid helium, copper and superconducting magnets. The apparatus stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds, but the focus is on a 36-inch vacuum cylinder. To reach microkelvin temperatures, a process that takes about two weeks, scientists first polarize copper with a superconducting magnet, then cool it to around 10 millikelvin in the refrigerator, which uses liquid helium rather than freon gas for cooling. Once the copper is at 10 millikelvin, the magnetic field is reduced and the copper nuclei, which are now aligned and highly ordered, take over, further cooling everything in the surrounding medium. `` We can never be sure what will be found,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. `` Maybe we'll have the good fortune to stumble upon a new science.''

 Americans are confident of a stable national economy and improving personal finances the next few years, but they remain wary of <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. A year after the stock market crashed, 71 percent of the 1,125 adults in the national survey said they regard it as a risky place to invest, and fully a third saw a good chance it will plummet again in the next year or two. But three-quarters said the crash had little or no effect on their lives, and only one in 10 said their finances had worsened in the past year. Even among the wealthiest, seven in 10 felt little impact from the crash. There was one apparent residual impact from the market's crash: More than six in 10 in the survey said they were being more cautious with their money now than they were a year ago. The Dow Jones industrial average dived 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, after dropping 108 points the previous Friday. Stock losses amounted to $ 500 billion, but the crash did not spark a recession, as had been feared. In the poll, 25 percent expected the nation's economy to worsen in the next few years. But nearly as many said it would improve, and a 43 percent plurality said they expected little change in the economy. There was even greater optimism about personal gains. Fifty-five percent expected their family's economic situation to improve in the short term, a third expected to hold steady and only 6 percent expected to do worse. The survey found a receptive audience for Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s theme of national prosperity. Most expressed satisfaction with their family's income, with 57 percent saying they were `` doing all right'' and 9 percent rating themselves `` well off.'' Nonetheless, a considerable 29 percent said they were `` just getting by'' and 5 percent said they were `` in hard times'' financially. The true number likely is higher because telephone surveys exclude the poorest households, the 7 percent without phones. A third in the poll said their family finances were better off now compared to a year ago, and a 56 percent majority said their situation was the same. Just 12 percent said they were doing worse. Seventy-three percent overall said they were saving for the future. But the market was not a preferred choice for saving: Seventy percent said they had no money in stocks, and 71 percent saw the market as risky. Among the wealthiest Americans, those making $ 50,000 or more a year, more than half had money in the market. But even in this group, 71 percent said they regarded the stock market as a risky investment. Even though three in 10 overall had stock investments, only 6 percent said the crash had a major impact on their lives, and only 15 percent said it had a moderate impact, for a total of 21 percent. By contrast, 28 percent said the market crash had little impact on their lives and 47 percent said it had no impact at all _ a total of 75 percent. Even among the wealthiest, 69 percent felt little or no impact. On the outlook for the market, 33 percent said there was a good chance of another crash in the next year or two and 26 percent were unsure. The plurality, 41 percent, said another crash was `` not too likely'' soon. The poll did not find broad support for greater government regulation of Wall Street. While a quarter favored it, four in 10 said current oversight was sufficient and 9 percent wanted less regulation. The rest were unsure. The poll, conducted Sept. 6-14, had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within plus or minus three points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The margin of error is higher for subgroups _ seven points, for example, for respondents earning $ 50,000 or more a year. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals are not exactly 100: 1. Overall, do you think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy is going to turn worse in the next few years, or improve, or stay about the same? Worse: 25 percent.

DK-NA: 16. 3. How would you rate your family's personal economic situation right now _ are you very well off, or doing all right, or just getting by, or are you in hard times financially? Well off: 9. All right: 57. Getting by: 29. Hard times: 5. DK-NA: 2. 4. Compared to a year ago, is your family's financial situation better today, or worse today, or about the same? Better: 32.

<HEAD>A Glossary of Financial Market Terms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a glossary of some frequently used terms related to the stock market: BARGAIN HUNTERS: Investors looking to buy shares at reduced prices in a period of market decline. CIRCUIT BREAKERS: A post-crash reform proposal to temporarily halt trading of stocks and futures contracts when prices plummet. COMPUTERIZED PROGRAM TRADING: A computer-run strategy enabling big institutional investors to make lightning-quick trades of huge amounts of stocks, stock index futures and options on index futures in attempts to profit from price disparities. DIVIDEND: A payment made to shareholders of a corporation from earnings, payable at a fixed rate on preferred shares and at a varying rate, according to the size of profits, on common shares. DOW JONES AVERAGE: Refers to the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, a closely watched barometer of blue-chip issues. GREAT CRASH: The stock market collapse that occurred on `` Black Monday,'' Oct. 28, 1929, when the Dow Jones average dropped 12.8 percent. The historic event helped trigger the Depression of the 1930s. INDEX ARBITRAGE: The purchase of a stock-index future in one market and sale of the stocks that comprise that index in another market, or vice versa, in order to profit from temporary price differences in the two markets. Index arbitrage is the most widely used form of computerized program trading. MARGIN ACCOUNT: A credit line enabling an investor to speculate in the market with shares bought with borrowed money that is backed by collateral such as the investor's stock holdings. Under Federal Reserve regulations, investors may borrow up to 50 percent of the value of a stock purchase. When the value of an investor's collateral falls below the amount of money the investor has borrowed to buy stock, a brokerage firm will make a `` margin call'' requiring the investor t put up more collateral or face the forced sale of the stock MUTUAL FUND: An organization that invests the money of its shareholders in a diversified group of securities of other corporations. OPTION: An agreement, usually for a fee, which permits an investor to buy or sell a stock or a stock index future within a specified time period in accordance with the terms of the agreement. PORTFOLIO INSURANCE: A strategy in which investors sell options or futures against the underlying stock in a portfolio to offset price declines and enhance price increases. SHORT SELLING: The practice of selling borrowed securities, expecting to be able to buy them later at a lower price before having to return them to the lender. STOCK: The permanently invested capital of a corporation contributed by the owners when the corporation is organized and then divided into shares, each representing a proportionate ownership in the company. Common stock enjoys an exclusive claim to net assets and profits of a corporation if no other class of stock is issued. Preferred stock, when issued, takes precedence over common stock according to specified terms. STOCK INDEX FUTURES: Contracts that allow investors to buy and sell theoretical packages of stocks for delivery at a future date. TRADING HALT: A measure designed to check a steep slide in the stock market. VOLATILITY: Wild price swings in stock trading. YIELD: The difference between the purchase price and the face value of a security.

 Last year's stock market crash decimated the hopes of nearly half the companies waiting to go public and reduced the amount of cash others could raise in the equity market, a study released today said. Of the 229 businesses on file with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 19, 1987 to issue stock for the first time, 45 percent had abandoned those plans nine months after `` Black Monday,'' according to the accounting and consulting firm <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>. `` The number of busted -LRB- initial public offerings -RRB- we identified is unprecedented,'' said <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgida </PERSON>, director of the firm's capital markets group and head of the study `` We all knew that going public was tougher after Black Monday. We just did n't know how tough.'' Fewer than 25 percent of the companies planning to go public were able to do so since the crash, the study showed. Another 31 percent still were on file with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to go public as of July 31. Those companies that braved the equities market succeeded in raising an average $ 15.9 million. But <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> estimated that each of those same companies would have raised an average of $ 7.2 million more had they completed their public offerings before the crash. Small and mid-sized companies were most severely affected, <PERSON> Borgida </PERSON> said. `` Most of the companies that wanted to go public could n't, and those that did had to settle for less capital than they needed.'' Of 51 companies that participated in a Grant <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> poll, 27 said they had obtained financing from alternative sources including commercial banks, private placements and, less frequently, from venture capitalists. Despite the grim environment, 86 percent of the companies participating in the poll _ including half of the businesses that withdrew their initial public offerings _ said they would considering going public if they could make the choice again. `` As least in the view of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s entrepreneurs, there is no substitute for going public,'' <PERSON> Borgida </PERSON> said. `` Even in this most difficult year for financing, companies still believe that they can raise the greatest amount of capital most efficiently through the public equity markets.''

<HEAD>Finance Minister Appologizes Over Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s finance minister apologized Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for his involvement in an insider stock trading scandal that has provoked a major debate over political ethics and delayed passage of a controversial tax bill. Responding to questioning by opposition parties, <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said he was unaware a former aide, <PERSON> Tsuneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON>, had allowed a friend to buy 10,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock in <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s name. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, the first Cabinet minister linked directly to the Recruit-Cosmos scandal, did not offer to resign but expressed regret for his involvement. `` I was truly careless,'' <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said. `` I'm sorry for failing to supervise well.'' Parliament remained stalemated Monday by opposition demands for a full investigation into the Recruit-Cosmos scandal. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, also said he had been `` careless.'' But he described the scandal as part of a larger problem arising from laws regulating financial dealings, tax administration and political ethics. Several senior politicians reportedly obtained shares in the real estate company in 1984 before the stock was offered to the public. The stock nearly quadrupled in value shortly after it was listed on the over-the-counter market, and the politicians made up to $ 780,000 each in profits. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> admitted in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last week that his aides had bought the shares in his name, reversing earlier denials of his involvement. But he said he had no previous knowledge of the dealings. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> released a list of nine people, including <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, who allegedly purchased the shares through a financial firm linked to <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION>. The list also included aides to Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, secretary general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The dealings raised serious ethical questions but broke no laws in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where companies have routinely given politicians stock certain to increase in value as political contributions. Parliament has since tightened laws involving such transactions, but the legislation is not retroactive.

 Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting pessimism about grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and an increase in crop sales by farmers. But early losses were slight due to the supportive influence of weekend rains in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and relatively dry growing conditions in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which are large producers of soybeans, analysts said. `` Their situation is improving down there, but they still need rain,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The weekend rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> slowed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and soybean harvest, which is more than half complete, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. More rain was expected today and Wednesday. On Friday, negotiators for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended two days of talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> without a new long-term grain agreement. Disappointment over the failure to produce an agreement continued to weigh on the markets today, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 4.26 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.93 a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents lower across the board with December at $ 2.50 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower with November at $ 8.02 a bushel Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .18 cent lower to .05 cent higher with October at 72.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .18 cent higher with October at 82.05 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .30 cent lower with October at 40.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to .30 cent lower with February at 48.80 cents a pound. Cattle finished mostly lower on Friday while pork futures were mixed.

<BYLINE>Saudis Hope To Curb Outflux of Petrodollars
^By DONNA FENN HEINTZEN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Saudi Arabians, fewer petrodollars in their pockets and worried about security and culture shock, have started looking for holidays at home and finding there is more to the country than sand. In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Moslems flocked to the kingdom's air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the great tourist capitals _ <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the French and Spanish Rivieras, <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. But local tourism has been on the rise for the past five years, spearheaded by a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend their vacation dollars at home. `` There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer when they go abroad,'' said <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sayed </PERSON>, director-general of tourism development in the country's mountainous southwest <LOCATION> Asir </LOCATION> region `` They do n't want their teen-agers to copy Westerners.'' He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language and cultural barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad. `` I've traveled in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and I've faced some of the troubles,'' said <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sayejh </PERSON>, public relations manager at the <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> Intercontinental Hotel. `` My family's now looking for a villa in <LOCATION> Abha </LOCATION>. There are many people who spend their summers there who used to go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Abha </LOCATION> is in the cooler, mountainous province of <LOCATION> Asir </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. He added: `` In the oil boom years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and boarding any available international flight. Now people are more aware of spending their money.'' Tourism within <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> may seem like a hard sell, given the country's reputation as a `` desert kingdom,'' lacking much in the way of amusement. But beaches in the country's <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> on the gulf draw big crowds. <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> on the Red Sea attracts scuba diving enthusiasts and Najran, close to <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, offers unusual architecture. For a change of scenery, many tourists try the southwest. `` The whole southwest area is very popular,'' said <PERSON> Antoni </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhnen </PERSON>, who runs the <PERSON> al-Baha </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON> in that region. <PERSON> Kuhnen </PERSON> estimates that the motel, opened in 1985, now books around 20,000 tourists a year. <PERSON> Al-Baha </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s smallest province, is situated between <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, where the government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and <LOCATION> Abha </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Asir </LOCATION> province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park. `` It's beautiful,'' said al-Sayejh. `` It reminds us of the old days when we used to go to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> every summer. The mountains are the same.'' A local newspaper noted that `` visitors to the <LOCATION> Abha </LOCATION> region reached an unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in <LOCATION> Abha </LOCATION> can not cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats.'' An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a relatively small airport. The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the government. Five years ago, the few tourists who came to al-Baha and <LOCATION> Abha </LOCATION> had to either camp out or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation. Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in tourism. `` As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come,'' said <PERSON> Kuhnen </PERSON>, who nonetheless feels the region suffers for lack of recreational diversions. An amusement park would make al-Baha more attractive to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> families who generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. Land has already been allocated, but awaits an investor. <PERSON> Al-Baha </PERSON> does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, the air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp _ a welcome change from just about any place else in the kingdom during the summer months. The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise dramatically out of the <LOCATION> Tihama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and are populated by shepherds tending flocks of sheep and goats. Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps of food fed to them by motel staff and early-rising guests. The historically minded tourist can retrace the Taif-Abha leg of the ancient frankincense route, which originally started in southern <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and ended in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. To the government, promoting internal tourism means more than just providing its citizens with vacation options. At a recent symposium on drugs, development of internal tourism was cited as one way to discourage youth from traveling abroad and encountering drug users and sellers. Newspapers frequently warn readers of the `` travails of foreign travel,'' citing examples of how unsuspecting Saudis are cheated.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs this week jumped by 11 to total 925, industry watcher <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Last week's count had declined by four to total 914. A year ago, the count was 1,134, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> announced Monday. The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.

In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500.

 Some housing and real estate folks are prepared to quash any attempts to lessen the tax deduction of home mortgage interest, suggesting that such efforts would be an attack on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream itself. Others in the industry, however, question the threat to home ownership, mainly because the current indebtedness cap _ the limit on mortgage interest that may be deducted from taxes _ is $ 1 million. In their view, an allowance of that size benefits very few Americans and, as a corollary, provides a huge tax deduction for a privileged few _ one that may have very little to do with providing shelter. The issue is controversial even within the industry. A commentary by <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, warning that some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wished to cut the million-dollar cap, drew both negative and positive responses. Perhaps typical of the negative responses was a letter to the editor of Realtor News, the association's weekly newspaper, stating that `` those fortunate enough to own a lavish home do not need the large tax savings.'' The most commonly cited reason for opposing any cut in the deductibility seems to be that one cut might be followed by more, perhaps even leading to eventual elimination of any deduction of home mortgage interest. Defending that stand, another letter to <ORGANIZATION> Realtor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> cautioned that when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is thwarted in attempts to raise taxes, members `` could merely lower the cap on the mortgage interest deduction and then tell their constituents that they were able to stave off any attempt to raise taxes.'' Whatever the merits or lack of them, the tax deductiblity has produced some situations that are difficult to equate with the promotion of home ownership. It can, for example, encourage homeownership as an investment rather than shelter. In one instance, an individual can invest in a home far more expensive than he or she might have purchased without the deduction. The purpose: To obtain a maximum mortgage that generates enough deductions to offset taxes on income. Moreover, any increases in the home's value is tax-deferred, meaning that no tax is paid until the house is sold. The same money invested in interest-bearing securities would be taxed annually. A big mortgage _ perhaps encouraged by the tax deductiblity _ also offers unusual leverage for an investor. If, for example, a $ 1.5 million house is purchased with the assistance of a million-dollar mortgage, and in a year's time rises 4 percent in value to $ 1.56 million, the original $ 500,000 cash investment has earned 12 percent. That $ 60,000 gain is, of course, tax deferred so long as the house is not sold. Moreover, the homeowner may obtain an additional, relatively low cost equity loan up to $ 100,000 for any purpose, and deduct all the interest. While the issue of the $ 1 million cap is fairly dormant at the moment, various proposals have been circulating through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, convincing <PERSON> Weigand </PERSON> and others that sometime next year another suggestion will be made to cut. As they see it, their stand is an effort to defend homeownership. As some critics view it, however, the issue is really whether a house should be a home, or a personal bank instead.

<HEAD>High-Tech Trading Advances Despite Doubts Raised by Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stock market crash triggered worries about the destructive effects of computers, but a year later the high-tech revolution in the financial marketplace is forging ahead relentlessly, especially outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Moreover, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers agonize over `` program trading'' and other high-tech investment tools that may have played roles in the crash a year ago Wednesday, computer advances abroad are raising serious questions about the competitiveness of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> financial markets in the 1990s and beyond. Such advances, for example, enable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors to use a British-owned computerized trading network called <ORGANIZATION> Instinet </ORGANIZATION> to buy or sell stocks abroad when domestic markets are closed. Elsewhere, from the world's oldest stock exchange in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> to the bourses of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, exchange officials have replaced order scribblers and floor traders with super-fast electronic display screens that enable investors of all nationalities to buy and sell more cheaply. `` I'm not sure we're doing anything differently, we're just doing it faster,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Instinet </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> that can electronically trade stocks in 14 countries. `` All we're doing is automating that which we've done before.'' Many experts believe securities markets in general, and American markets in particular, are in danger of becoming obsolete because computers have made it so easy to cheaply trade stocks, bonds and other financial items. `` Technology is inevitable,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a market expert and professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> graduate business school. `` It allows people to communicate and transact very quickly. That means the role of an exchange is more and more vague.'' The implications of this change are profound, <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> and others say. For one thing, it means the post-crash era will be marked by more exotic investing techniques and a need for an even faster flow of information, rather than a retreat to traditional, conservative patterns. The change also means that the titan <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which still handles most of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock trading, could face serious threats to its survival as investors find it more efficient and cheaper to trade elsewhere. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s greatest asset is its building,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Niehoff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, one of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exchanges to totally automate and bypass the humans who match buyers with sellers. `` Dinosaurs go,'' <PERSON> Niehoff </PERSON> said. `` Over time, I just do n't see the need for -LRB- trading -RRB- floors. I can see a lot more at a terminal than I can see at a floor post.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, alarmed not only by the market weaknesses during the crash but by the role computers will play in the future, has ordered a major study into the relationship between technology and the securities industry. Conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, it is expected to be done by December 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, also sensing a threat, is aggressively expanding its own computer capacity to handle enormous volumes, from 250 million shares a day in 1984 to 600 million a day this year and 1 billion daily in the next decade. The exchange also has tinkered with other innovations that it says will enhance the ability of its market makers, known as specialists, to price stocks fairly and trade them efficiently, keys to any stock market's success. Critics say the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts, in the long run, are a futile attempt to preserve dominance of the specialists in a world they no longer can control. Some liken the exchange's use of computers to an ultra-modern telephone system in which all calls must still be placed through human operators. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets have taken a markedly different approach to the future, acknowledging the inevitability of 24-hour automated trading and the possible exodus of American investment business overseas. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, for example, plans a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> for an electronic network, called <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, allowing all-night trading of currency futures and options and interest-rate futures on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> closes down at night and allows <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to establish markets in its commodities, it might decline faster,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tattersall </PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, which intends to start by next summer. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities industry's differing approaches to technology in the post-crash era have alarmed some experts, who say a strong and unified stand is crucial. `` ` If it ai n't broke, do n't fix it,' is the cry of too many industry leaders today,'' <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peake </PERSON>, a capital-markets consultant and founder of Bermuda-based <ORGANIZATION> Intex </ORGANIZATION>, the first fully electronic exchange, told a recent <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> conference on market technology. `` Just because something works does n't mean that it is n't approaching obsolescence or is actually obsolete.''

 Stock prices were slightly higher in quiet trading today, getting little benefit from new evidence of a slowing economy.

Gainers narrowly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 692 up, 656 down and 533 unchanged. Analysts said traders took a generally upbeat view of the current state of the economy, believing that growth has slowed of late to a steady, sustainable pace. Those hopes drew some fresh support from government statistics issued this morning that showed a drop in capacity use in September. But inflation worries have n't been entirely snuffed out on Wall Street, and brokers said investors were looking ahead warily to Friday's scheduled report on the consumer price index for September. Furthermore, just about all market-watchers agree, stocks are likely to be a tough product to sell all week with the anniversary Wednesday of last fall's crash, and all the attendant publicity. <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> rose -LCB- to 48 -RCB- in active trading.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Monday to open its first manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a move that could be viewed as a tit for tat with rival <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd.. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> expects to open its finishing and packaging facility for certain graphic arts films by the end of the year, said company spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> It is in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> and will initially employ 10 workers. `` There may be some thought that this will send a message to <LOCATION> Fuji </LOCATION> that if they do more in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will do more in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Enderlin </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement comes 10 days after <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> held groundbreaking ceremonies for its first manufacturing plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Laughlin </PERSON>. That plant, located in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, will also make products for the graphic arts industry. It will employ about 150 people and be about seven times larger than <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s facility. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to open a plant in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had nothing to do with <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> or any other competitor. `` This is not a reaction to that.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Block Vaccine Lawsuit in Virginia Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 10 million lawsuit against the maker of a whooping cough vaccine that allegedly caused brain damage in an infant should go to trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed products, even if the federal government approves the products. In other business-related cases, the justices: _ Refused to hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Hallmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of an injunction barring it from selling greeting cards resembling those produced by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, a small company in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> _ Agreed to consider allowing states to give larger retirement benefits to public employees forced to quit work before age 60 The case involves an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> pension law provision that gave a 61-year-old state employee lower disability retirement benefits than she would have gotten if she had been younger. _ Agreed to hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations The justices said they will use a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION> to settle a dispute over the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to obtain and use confidential documents. The vaccine case involves <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON>, who was 5 months old in August 1983 when she was inoculated with a vaccine called Tri-Immunol manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Her mother sued <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 charging the vaccine caused brain damage in Tracy and asking $ 10 million in damages. Tri-Immunol is a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough _ or pertussis _ and is administered to millions of children without serious side effects. But it has caused serious injury in a small number of children. The vaccine is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other government health agencies. Only one other company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is licensed to produce a whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough claimed thousands of lives before the vaccine was developed. The most serious <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> epidemic was in 1934 when there were 265,000 reported cases and 7,500 deaths. The Abbot suit contends Tri-Immunol is `` unreasonably dangerous'' and says <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> failed to develop a safer vaccine even though other forms of the vaccine have been used outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A federal judge threw out the suit, but the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated it in April. The appeals court rejected arguments that the federal government's interest in promoting use of the vaccine would be frustrated by permitting suits alleging violation of state regulations. Federal law does not pre-empt such suits, the appeals court said. In a somewhat related issue, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in June that the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent. That case reinstated a suit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio after receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has not announced a position on the Abbot suit. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has pointed out that alternative vaccines to the type <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> produces have not been proven safe and effective. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed a law, which took full effect Oct. 1, creating a fund to help compensate children injured by vaccines. The new law places a tax on some vaccines to provide funds for injuries that occur from vaccinations after 1986.

 Stock prices showed a modest gain in quiet trading today, aided by new evidence of a slowing economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.18 to 2,141.36 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 730 up, 664 down and 531 unchanged. Analysts said traders took a generally upbeat view of the current state of the economy, believing that growth has slowed of late to a steady, sustainable pace. Those hopes drew some fresh support from government statistics issued this morning that showed a drop in capacity use in September. But inflation worries have n't been entirely snuffed out on Wall Street, and brokers said investors were looking ahead warily to Friday's scheduled report on the consumer price index for September. Furthermore, just about all market-watchers agree, stocks are likely to be a tough product to sell all week with the anniversary Wednesday of last fall's crash, and all the attendant publicity. <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> rose -LCB- to 48 -RCB- in active trading. A special committee of outside directors rejected a $ 51-a-share buyout bid by management, asserting that there were other parties that might be willing to make a higher offer. Other gains among the volume leaders included <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, up -RCB- at 26 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 | at 121 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up -LRB- at 26 -RCB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .47 to 155.93. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .57 at 303.12. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 99.37 million shares with an hour to go.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Governments, Private Banks Must Slash Debt Of Third
World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Governments and private lenders must write off part of the Third World's debt if they hope to see those nations recover from economic stagnation, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in a report released Monday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is scheduled Wednesday to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committee dealing with the world debt crisis, and the committee's resolution will go to the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for debate In introducing the secretary-general's report, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripert </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s office of Development and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` the service of their debt is killing investment in these -LRB- developing -RRB- countries.'' `` The report before you relates the debt problem squarely to the current crisis of development in a large part of the world,'' <PERSON> Ripert </PERSON> said. `` Lack of finance, low commodity prices, high interest rates, severe protectionism are leading to substantive net transfer of resources from developing and debtor nations to the developed countries. `` If the present trends continue, the debt crisis will remain an obstacle to growth in the indebted countries for at least another decade.'' Writing off debt, unthinkable in the financial community a year ago, `` is no more a taboo'' since the seven major industrial democracies advocated forgiving part of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s debt at their summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> last summer, according to the report. The secretary-general's report notes the so-called `` moral hazard'' of forgiving debts if that leads to new borrowing, but notes that `` politicians are not generally considered successful by their constituents if they need an international rescue.'' If the 15 most indebted developing countries received forgiveness of 30 percent of their private bank debt or interest payments due, about $ 10 billion would be available for growth-producing investment, the report says. Those 15 countries are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which together owe about $ 300 billion to commercial banks. Developing nations owed a total of about $ 1.2 trillion to governments and commercial lenders at the end of 1987. Much of the new investment `` could be expected to be channelled into imports of capital goods from developed market-economy countries,'' benefiting their economies, says the report. The report estimates that those orders would boost the economies of the developed countries by about 1 percent of their industrial output. Governments in developed countries should also forgive debt owed to them as a result of foreign aid loans, the report says. The secretary-general's report was prepared with analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Trade and Development in consultation with leading financiers.

 A consortium of West German banks on Monday signed a $ 1.6 billion credit agreement for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest commercial bank which is heading the consortium, said it signed the agreement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Refuses To Hear Hallmark Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday without comment refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Hallmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal of an injunction that bars it from making and distributing greeting cards at issue in a lawsuit filed by a small <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> firm. The ruling is the latest development in the legal dispute between Hallmark, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Mo.-based greeting card giant, and tiny Blue Mountain Arts of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. At the center of the dispute is <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that Hallmark copied a line of cards featuring watercolor decorations and long free-verse poetry. Hallmark contends the market should be open to competing versions of the cards. Blue Mountain, on the other hand, is bent on protecting what it believes is a unique creation. `` This legal battle is emotionally draining and is tiring us out, but we are strongly committed to this fight for artists' rights,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gall </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> had filed a lawsuit against Hallmark accusing the company of copying the cards. The case is scheduled to go to trial Jan. 2 in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` Given the procedural precedents, this action was not unexpected,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyal </PERSON>, Hallmark's corporate media relations manager, in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s move. Hallmark has denied the `` copycat'' allegations, and it challenged a November 1986 injunction imposed by <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> federal Judge <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON> that prohibits Hallmark from producing and distributing the cards. Hallmark has since stopped printing the 83 cards in question, said <PERSON> Doyal </PERSON>. Hallmark attorneys had said the injunction gives Blue Mountain a monopoly on such cards that is `` unlimited in time and scope.'' But with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to hear the appeal, the injunction will stand. `` The legal issues now to be tried concerns whether any card company should have the right to create a monopoly simultaneously with an artist's completed work product,'' said <PERSON> Doyal </PERSON>. `` While such a legal policy would ultimately benefit Hallmark, given our size and creative staff, it would actually stifle the viability of small companies such as Blue Mountain.''

 Financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and leaders of ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' unions have reached an impasse in their talks on a joint takeover offer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, sources close to the discussions said Monday. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, met with the union leaders over the weekend, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The talks broke down mainly because <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was seeking wage concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions that the union leaders considered too severe, the sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, a source close to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said no further meetings between <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and the unions had been scheduled.

 Hopes appeared to fade on Monday for an agreement to end a computer industry split over the future of Unix, a base layer of software that makes it easier for different brands of computers to communicate. The fight over Unix has dismayed computer users, who are left undecided about which rival version of Unix they should adopt as their own. Programs that work with one version of Unix may not work with the other. Several companies involved in the high-stakes tussle are planning to issue a statement Tuesday rallying around <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s version of Unix, the weekly trade newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Computerworld </ORGANIZATION> said in Monday's editions.

Although <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T invented Unix, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> say its development should be controlled by an industrywide organization so <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T does not have an unfair advantage with it. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has said it will not join the <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> unless it uses <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's version of Unix as the core of a new operating system.

<HEAD>Upjohn's Profit Up 20 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 20 percent rise in its third-quarter profit from a year earlier, due largely to an increase in foreign sales and favorable foreign-exchange rates. The pharmaceutical company said Monday that its net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $ 89.6 million, or 49 cents a share, from $ 74.6 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter sales were up 7 percent, to $ 651.8 million from $ 608.5 million. Foreign sales, which account for 39 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s total sales, jumped 14 percent in the quarter while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales rose only 3 percent. The continued slide in the dollar against other major currencies made <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s products cheaper and more competitive overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> said its Rogaine anti-baldness formula led its major products in foreign sales growth. Rogaine was approved Aug. 17 for marketing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is expected to contribute to continued foreign and domestic gains, Chairman <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. Rogaine now is sold in more than 50 countries including <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where it is called Regaine. `` But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval was critical to realizing the product's full potential,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> announced last week that Rogaine was available in pharmacies for men whose doctors prescribe it. The company said it was briefing physicians on the product in preparation for a public promotional campaign. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> also reported third-quarter sales gains for its Xanax and Halcion central nervous system agents and its Micronase oral antidiabetes medication. A 19 percent increase in sales of agricultural items, including animal health products and seed, also helped sales, the company said. In the first nine months of the year, net income rose 17 percent _ to $ 272.8 million, or $ 1.47 a share, from $ 234.1 million, or $ 1.25 a share, a year earlier. Nine-month sales grew 9 percent, to $ 2.04 billion from $ 1.87 billion.

 Stock prices struggled to a small gain in quiet trading today, aided by new evidence of a slowing economy. Analysts said traders took a generally upbeat view of the current state of the economy, believing that growth has slowed of late to a steady, sustainable pace. Those hopes drew some fresh support from government statistics issued this morning that showed a drop in capacity use in September. But inflation worries have n't been entirely snuffed out on Wall Street, and brokers said investors were looking ahead warily to Friday's scheduled report on the consumer price index for September. Furthermore, just about all market-watchers agree, stocks are likely to be a tough product to sell all week with the anniversary Wednesday of last fall's crash, and all the attendant publicity.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest banking company, on Monday reported its third-quarter profit jumped 25 percent, while earnings rose 6.6 percent at No. 4-ranked <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and 80 percent at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 11th-largest banker <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it earned $ 283 million, or $ 3.09 a share, during the three months ended Sept. 30, up from $ 226 million, or $ 2.55 a share, in the same period a year earlier. For the first three quarters of 1988, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it had earnings of $ 784 million, or $ 8.62 per share, compared with a loss of $ 1.05 billion for the same period last year. The results for the 1987 period included a second-quarter charge of $ 1.6 billion to cover shaky Third World debt. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said its third-quarter net income totaled $ 233.6 million, or $ 1.25 a share, up from earnings of $ 219.2 million, or $ 1.18 a share, in the same period a year ago. For the first nine months, the company had a profit of $ 743.7 million, or $ 4 a share, compared with a $ 140.8 million loss in the same period of 1987. The year-earlier results included an $ 875 million loan-loss provision similar to those taken by <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> and other major banks. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter profit jumped 80 percent, to $ 111.1 million, or $ 1.73 per share, from $ 61.8 million, or $ 1.05 a share, in the same period of 1987. For the nine-month period, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> earned a record $ 375.8 million, or $ 6.13 a share, compared with a $ 474.2 million loss last in the first nine months of last year, when it added $ 855 million to its loan-loss reserves. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said its third-quarter earnings included an after-tax gain of about $ 103 million from changes in its pension plan. The company said the results also included higher foreign exchange trading income, investment banking fees and trading account gains. The company reported a decline in net interest income because it placed about $ 538 million in credit to Argentine borrowers on nonaccrual status. That means the bank will no longer include on its own statements the interest and other charges due on the loans until the money is actually received. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> attributed its improved earnings performance partly to higher non-interest operating income, due largely to foreign exchange and trading profits, which more than doubled from a year ago. The company's provision for credit losses of $ 20 million was unchanged from the 1987 quarter. First <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said its provision for loan losses declined to $ 50 million from $ 75 million a year ago, and that helped improve the earnings picture in the third quarter. `` Our progress ... is shown by the improvement both in capital ratios and in credit quality, where we have the lowest provision for credit losses in four years,'' Chairman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in a statement.

 A new, $ 50 million <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> research and development center, planned for operation by 1990, will design and create a new vehicle for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. `` If we were n't going to do this next project, then we'd have no reason to do this research and development,'' <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, vice president for design engineering for <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said at a ground breaking for the new center northwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` Sometime next year, we will begin the next vehicle to be manufactured in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> plant,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>'s factory in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where the company makes its Sentra cars and light trucks. He declined to characterize the new vehicle. The <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> plant has room for another assembly line and enough land for new factories. Also at the ceremony, <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanuma </PERSON>, president of the research and development company, said the center will provide design and other research work for a minivan to be assembled as a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the unspecified vehicle. <PERSON> Tanuma </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the new vehicle would not be exported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Our main objective is to design a car and truck for this country,'' <PERSON> Tanuma </PERSON> said. He said the decision to put the center in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area came because of the number of automotive engineers in the area. <PERSON> Tanuma </PERSON> also said the company was considering putting an engine plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a move some people have seen as essential to broadening the company's assembly capabilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The center, to occupy 200,000 to 250,000 square feet at the site of a former golf club, will employ about 400 people, three-fourths of them <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, officials said.

 The dollar rose Monday against most major currencies after reports of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> lifted it from its lows of the day.

<TEXT>
 Corning Glass Works more than doubled its net income in the third quarter to a record $ 123.9 million from $ 50 million during the same period last year, the company said Monday. Corning Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> said `` the excellent results came from equity companies as well as strength across the board in virtually all <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> businesses, where the rate of profitability was the best we've seen for a third quarter in the last decade.'' Even without one-time gains of $ 59 million stemming from transactions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the third-quarter results were a company record. On a per-share basis, <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> returned $ 2.74 compared to $ 1.08 a year ago. Sales for quarter totaled $ 625.4 million, up 2.5 percent from $ 610.1 million in the same period a year ago. The company said the figure was up 11 percent if adjusted for the disposition of the electronics business in 1987. For the 40 weeks ended Oct. 9, the company reported net income of $ 243 million, up from $ 148.5 million, and sales of $ 1.58 billion, up from $ 1.54 billion. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s restructuring efforts during the past few years have paid off. The glass maker based in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has focused its research and development in four main areas _ fiber optics and telecommunications; medical diagnostic services; ceramics and specialty glasses; and household products. Optical fiber sales were modestly improved, according to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertalli </PERSON>, a Corning vice president. `` We projected a flat year in the volatile fiber optics market,'' <PERSON> Albertalli </PERSON> said. `` We're doing a little better than we expected.'' The company's clinical testing service subsidiary, MedPath, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, expanded exports to Latin American and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and was part of the reason for a 31 percent increase in income from equity companies. A new manufacturing facility being built by <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Osooka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is expected to expand <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s presence in the world market for specialty glass. The plant, which is due to open in 1989, will manufacture glass used in the display modules of portable computers and other electronic devices. The companies household products unit, which manufactures Corning Glassware, also showed strong sales gains.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> paid out $ 20 million for claims on drought insurance it issued to farmers in seven <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, announced Monday. Federal also paid $ 11 million in `` goodwill'' payments to farmers who applied for the insurance but did not receive coverage, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 16th largest property and casualty insurer, was criticized this summer for backing away from an insurance offer that would pay off if there was not enough rain. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said the 8,800 applications for $ 350 million in coverage far exceeded the $ 43 million in coverage it could provide. About 7,000 farmers who did not get insurance were paid twice the amount of their premium as compensation. `` This completes the loss payments on all the -LRB- 1,176 -RRB- policies we issued,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>. `` It's premature to talk about drought insurance'' for next year <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> estimated it would have paid an additional $ 55 million for claims if it had provided coverage for all the farmers who wanted it. Ms. <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON> said she knew of no change in the status of lawsuits pending against the company in several states. The estimated state-by-state payments were: _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, issued 265 policies worth $ 10 million, paid $ 5.9 million in losses, paid $ 1.3 million for 721 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, issued 463 policies worth $ 16.3 million, paid $ 9.8 million in losses, paid $ 2.1 million for 1,543 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, issued 135 policies worth $ 4.8 million, paid $ 1.2 million in losses, paid $ 3.3 million for 1,922 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, issued no policies, paid $ 116,000 for 54 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, issued three policies worth $ 73,000, paid nothing for losses, paid $ 2.2 million for 1,090 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, issued 228 policies worth $ 8.7 million, paid $ 2.7 million in losses, paid $ 1.4 million for 773 goodwill payments _ Missouri, issued no policies, paid $ 34,000 for 18 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, issued 68 policies worth $ 2.8 million, paid $ 100,000 in losses, paid $ 700,000 for 663 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, issued no policies, paid $ 44,000 for 10 goodwill payments _ <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, issued 14 policies worth $ 500,000, paid $ 133,000 in losses, paid $ 200,000 for 183 goodwill payments

 Platinum futures prices rose sharply Monday on speculative buying, leading gold and silver higher in what analysts said may indicate a bullish turnaround in the precious metals market. On other futures markets, energy, cattle, grains, soybeans and stock-index futures advanced while pork futures were mixed. Precious metals prices appear to be steadying and may be charting an upward course after falling sharply last month, analysts said. Platinum is expected to be in short supply for the next five years and does not face technical resistance as stiff as that which gold and silver must overcome to rally substantially, they said. But the gold and silver markets also have shown surprising resilience in the past 10 days, defying some analysts' predictions that gold was heading back below $ 400 a troy ounce. `` There's some bullish tone for the first time in quite a while. It smells more bullish at these levels than it did before,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, vice president of the precious metals and foreign exchange group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Platinum settled $ 9.70 to $ 11.20 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in October at $ 538.40 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 3 to $ 3.10 higher with the spot October contract at $ 412.20 a troy ounce and December at $ 415.50; silver was 4 cents higher across the board with December at $ 6.475 a troy ounce on the Comex. Monday's weaker dollar and higher energy markets helped boost to the inflation-sensitive precious metals but there was more to the buying, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. `` It's not just because of crude or just because of the lower dollar,'' he said. `` There's some momentum building here that I just did n't see when gold was at $ 406 -LRB- last week -RRB-.'' The buying interest may be due to a readjustment of attitudes about inflation, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, manager of precious metals for New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a large dealer of precious metals and foreign currencies. Gold rallied late last year and early this year on fears of double-digit inflation, he said. Those worries eased _ and gold prices fell _ as monthly government reports showed inflation holding steady at 4 percent to 5 percent. But now investors may be growing uncomfortable with even a 4 percent inflation rate and could be buying precious metals as an inflation hedge, <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said. Oil prices posted solid gains on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> on news that oil ministers of the six-nation <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had thrown their support behind a plan to increase <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output quotas as a way to stabilize prices. The proposed cap of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day would be less than what <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is producing now but might lessen the pressure to overproduce, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 22 cents to 29 cents higher with November at $ 15.21 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to .67 cent higher with November at 43.88 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was unchanged to 1.34 cents higher with November at 46.76 cents a gallon. Cattle futures made new life-of-contract highs in all delivery months on expectations that Friday's quarterly cattle-on-feed report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will show the first quarterly decline since spring 1987 in the number of cattle being fattened for slaughter, analysts said. Pork futures finished mixed on a combination of lower cash markets and spillover strength from the cattle pits. Live cattle settled .18 cent to .60 cent higher with October at 73.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .75 cent higher with October at 82.22 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .55 cent higher with October at 39.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 49.05 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to wet weather in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION>, dry conditions in the soybean fields of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and new wheat demand from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, analysts said. Wheat settled unchanged to 4 cents higher with December at $ 4.30 \ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.95 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.55 \ a bushel; soybeans were 5 -LCB- cents to 8 cents higher with November at $ 8.10 -RCB- Stock-index futures rose strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.35 points higher at 278.25.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported record third-quarter profits on Monday, but both of the computer makers said they expected a slowdown next year. They said demand was softest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of personal computer software, said its profit fell 25.1 percent and blamed the decline on the cost of promotions for its 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said it expected its results next year to be hurt by `` weak conditions'' in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer market, the tight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget and the renewed strength of the dollar, which makes American-made goods more expensive in foreign markets. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said it was aiming for single-digit revenue increases but double-digit earnings gains in 1989. <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> also said it expected single-digit percentage gains in revenue next year, but made no profit forecast. The company said its orders had fallen in the latest quarter from the record levels of a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, which has headquarters in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said its profit rose 16.4 percent to a record $ 151 million, or 72 cents per share on a fully diluted basis, from $ 129.7 million, or 65 cents per fully diluted share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $ 2.27 billion from $ 2.22 billion. Fully diluted refers to the number of shares that would be outstanding if all convertible preferred stock were converted into common shares. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 28.1 percent to $ 462.6 million, or $ 2.22 per fully diluted share, from $ 361.1 million, or $ 1.84 a fully diluted share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $ 7.03 billion from $ 6.91 billion. <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said its revenue and earnings were a record for a third quarter. Earnings rose to $ 103.1 million, or $ 1.26 a share, from $ 97.8 million, or $ 1.05 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 1.41 billion from $ 1.34 billion. For the nine months, profit rose 12.3 percent to $ 289.7 million, or $ 3.49 a share, from $ 257.9 million, or $ 2.74 a share, a year earlier. Revenue to $ 4.19 billion from $ 3.82 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said it took a charge against its earnings to reflect the costs it will incur when it gives free upgrades to its upcoming version of Lotus 1-2-3 to the people who purchased existing versions under a special promotion. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>, which repeatedly has postponed introduction of the new software, said it earned $ 14.3 million in the quarter ended Oct. 1, or 31 cents a share, down from $ 19.1 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $ 116.8 million, from $ 101.2 million. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose to $ 49.9 million, or $ 1.08 a share, from $ 49.1 million, also $ 1.08 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 356.2 million, from $ 280 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter earnings increased 7.9 percent to $ 68 million because of the sale of the company's <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pump </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oilwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> operations, the company said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for the third quarter last year were $ 63 million. Net earnings per share rose to $ 1.11, from $ 1.01 last year. Sales totaled $ 1.65 billion, off 3 percent from $ 1.70 billion a year ago. The company said its $ 63 million after-tax gain from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pump </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oilwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> were partially offset by an after-tax charge of $ 43 million to cover the cost of a program to resolve claims from dealers and truck owners arising from the recall of integral steering gears for heavy-duty trucks. `` Our space and defense business was down somewhat, as expected given the current market uncertainty and last year's very strong third quarter,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mettler </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` Without the recall costs, our automotive business would have posted another good quarter and what has been a very good year for the segment.'' Sales in the space and defense segment dropped 5 percent from $ 827 million to $ 786 million. In the automotive segment, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter sales rose 11 percent from $ 513 million to $ 679 million. Sales in the information systems segment rose 6 percent from $ 128 million to $ 135 million, the company said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Continent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> laid off 140 miners Monday and blamed federal mine inspectors for oppressive enforcement. The coal company claims that excessive inspections by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, including 273 safety orders and 1,381 safety citations in the past year, prevents Mid-Continent from filling a South Korean coal contract. The layoffs came four days after a federal judge declined to issue an injunction requested by Mid-Continent to halt what the company views as overzealous inspections by <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION>. However, the top federal inspector for western coal mines said he put round-the-clock inspectors at the <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> mines because <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Continent </ORGANIZATION> continually failed to meet safety standards. In 1981, 15 miners died in a methane explosion at a Mid-Continent mine. The company's property is in the <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, about 40 miles from <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMichiei </PERSON>, western manager for <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION>, said Mid-Continent miners should n't be exposed to the hazards he's found in the deep, gassy mines. `` We're not fabricating problems,'' he said. `` A failure to comply will inevitably result in another incident.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Mid-Continent, said the layoff of 29 percent of the company's work force was `` too bad, because it's not necessary But until we get this worked out with <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION>, we ca n't work.

 <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest accounting firm in the nation, announced a new name for its lucrative consulting division Monday in a move thought to be prompted by concerns over ethics and personnel. The change in the division's name _ from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> _ `` creates a clear, separate identity,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON>, managing partner and chief executive officer of the Chicago-based company. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s consulting service helps businesses tailor computer systems to their specific needs. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> launched a study last month to consider a possible restructuring of the entire company, which some observers believe may be a prelude to splitting off consulting as an independent business. The growth of consulting services at major accounting firms has raised questions about the ethics of supposedly objective accounting companies advising their clients on managerial decisions. Some experts have said the ethical problems can only be solved by splitting off consulting as a separate business. Consultants at accounting firms complain that although they are responsible for much of their firms' revenue growth, they are treated and paid as second-class citizens by managing partners who came up through the tax and audit business. The rift has cost <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> some of its top consulting partners, including four who quit on Friday to join a new consulting venture. The consulting arm of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> accounts for about 40 percent of the company's total revenue and is growing at a rate of about 30 percent a year, officials said. Consulting fees are expected to total more than $ 1.3 billion at privately held <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> this year, compared with $ 1.7 billion in revenue from the company's tax and audit portion.

 British Airways may purchase a number of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 aircraft to replace its aging fleet of short takeoff-and-landing passenger planes, a spokesman for the airline said Monday. The small, two-engine 737 is among several aircraft <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> is sizing up as a successor to the BAC 1-11s due to be removed soon from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s main airports, <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION>, said the spokesman on condition of anonymity. The 99-seat BAC 1-11s, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, will be transferred to provincial airports, said the spokesman. A decision from top <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> management on which replacement aircraft to purchase is expected soon, the spokesman said. Other aircraft under consideration are the British Aerospace BAe-146, the <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 100 and the Airbus A320. `` Historically, we've tended to be a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airline,'' said the spokesman. `` Their aircraft fit the profile we want.'' The spokesman denied a report in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> directors had already decided to purchase 35 aircraft from the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, aircraft manufacturer. The newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would purchase 25 of the 737s worth more than $ 750 million and about 10 longer-distance 767 medium-sized jets. The 737 aircraft would be from the 300, 400 and 500 series, providing between 110 and 160 seats, the story said. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> declined comment on the report. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is not to discuss aircraft sales or negotiations until a customer announces them.

The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm said it and others `` had invested millions of dollars in <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> in reliance on defendants' material misrepresentations, omissions and acts of fradulent concealment.'' It charged <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> began selling income-producing assets in 1986 to pay its debts because of failed investments in real estate and in oil and gas. It charged the company then overstated the value of its remaining operations. Although the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate realized more than $ 500 million from the sales, the money representated `` far less than ... their real market value,'' according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also charged that a March 1987 tender offer by a subsidiary of the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> relied on inflated projections of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s performance Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> purchased additional shares of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> stock based on the projections, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit charged that the true financial state of the company was reflected in <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it has lost $ 285.4 million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 27, 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanoff </PERSON> declined comment on the lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> sought protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws in February.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> negotiators met Monday for extended contract talks amid speculation that the two sides had agreed at least in principle on an acceptable job-security package, considered a major roadblock. `` It's my understanding they're just working out the language on the details,'' one <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> source, who declined to give his name, said of the reports that accord was near on 85 percent job security. `` Progress has been made,'' Local 974 bargaining chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We're moving. That's good.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON>, international <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> secretary-treasurer, said negotiators were to meet again Monday night with hope of ironing out more contract details. `` I'd like to get out of here tonight, not physically but at least with an agreement,'' <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON> said. ` We're going to work at it -LRB- and -RRB- try to do it, but I do n't know if it will happen. I got out of the prediction business a long time ago.'' <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON> declined to confirm the 85 percent job-security provision in the new contract, instead noting that several issues remained on the table. `` We're not going to pick and choose. We're going to work on all of them,'' he said. `` Just when you think the minefield is clear you end up stepping on one if you're not careful.'' Also still to be resolved is whether provisions concerning special job classifications will be decided at the local or the national level. The union has said that <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> wanted to create new special job classifications that would restrict workers from transferring to other jobs within the company.

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will receive a short-term loan of up to $ 3.5 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to support new economic reforms the country is instituting, officials said Monday. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial authorities believe that these measures -LRB- in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB- build upon the progress already achieved in the sustained adjustment effort undergone by the Mexican economy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and central bank said in a statement. The loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> is intended as a `` bridge'' until <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> can develop a longer-term loan program with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The Mexican government on Saturday announced a series of measures designed to cope with the unanticipated decline in world oil prices. They included more privatization of state-owned businesses, a plan to hold down the Mexican budget deficit and the extension, through the end of the year, of the so-called Economic Solidarity Pact. The pact, among the business, labor and government sectors, includes a series of inflation-fighting moves including a freeze on peso currency exchange rates and on the minimum wage and on prices for government-regulated goods and services. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement praised `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s adjustment record'' in reducing its budget deficit and improving its trade balance, which it said `` has established the basic conditions for the renewal of sustained economic growth.'' `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities have agreed that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s strengthened economic policies merit support,'' the statement said

 Two researchers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday for helping develop drugs to fight AIDS, herpes, leukemia, malaria, heart disease and stomach ulcers. The award capped more than four decades of pioneering work for <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, who began collaborating in 1945. They work at <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. They share the $ 390,000 prize with Sir <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> His research led to a beta blocker drug for heart disease and a drug for peptic ulcers. `` I wished I had my beta blockers handy,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, 64, quipped at a news conference at King's College after he learned he won. Dr. <PERSON> Gosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garton </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which awards the prize, said the three winners were `` well-chosen.'' `` You can see the direct working effects'' of their research, said <PERSON> Garton </PERSON>. `` The entire research world knows that they have been in the picture for years.'' The Nobel Assembly credited <PERSON> Elion </PERSON>, 70, and <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, 83, with helping develop six different drugs that can be used for at least nine serious conditions. They included 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine for leukemia; azathioprine for organ transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases; allopurinol for gout; acyclovir for herpes virus infections, pyrimethamine for malaria; and trimethoprim for bacterial infections and pulmonary infections brought on by AIDS. The assembly said their ideas also paved the way for development of azidothymidine, or AZT, which is the best documented drug so far in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. AIDS, usually transmitted through sexual contact, infected needles or blood transfusions, renders the immune system unable to resist disease. AZT is the only federally approved drug for treating AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,'' <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> said from his office at Wellcome. `` I've had a lot of honors, but the most important honors for me have been meeting patients whose lives have been saved or whose children's lives have been saved by drugs I've invented.'' <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> said from her home in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>, that she could n't believe she won and did n't even know she was nominated Asked about her greatest achievement, she said: `` You ca n't discriminate among your ` children. Each one in its own time was the most exciting.'' <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> broke new ground in finding the difference in the processing of genetic material between normal cells and cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and viruses, the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> said. Knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack disease-causing organisms by interfering with their replication without harming healthy ones, the assembly said. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> helped develop propranolol, a beta blocker used to treat heart disease and high blood pressure. Beta blockers block the stimulating effect of adrenaline on the heart, reducing the rate and the force at which the heart pumps blood through the body _ and reducing high blood pressure. `` Previously used drugs acted by increasing the oxygen transport to the heart. In contrast, <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s idea was to decrease the oxygen demand of the heart,'' the announcement said. Specialists said <PERSON> Black </PERSON> also contributed to treatments for stroke and high blood pressure. Physiologist <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Pernow </PERSON>, another member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Black </PERSON> made `` the greatest breakthrough when it comes to pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of digitalis 200 years ago.'' In 1972, Black developed another medication, cimetidine, which introduced a new principle in the treatment of peptic ulcer. `` Black in the laboratory has relieved more human suffering than thousands of doctors in a lifetime at the bedside,'' said <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, head of pharmacology at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said scientists are under too much pressure to produce immediate practical results. `` I think there needs to be much more money for scientists to do experiments they are almost ashamed of because they're so untested,'' he said. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and earned degrees in surgery and medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> has worked at <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> since 1944 and as a senior research chemist since 1950. Since 1983, she has been a scientist emeritus at the laboratory, which is the research arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pharmaceutical firm. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> has been a research professor of pharmacology at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> since 1983. She earned her bachelor's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1937 and a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1941. <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> received a bachelor's degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in 1927 and a doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1933. After teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he joined <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> in 1942. He became its research director in 1955 and was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> researcher won the medicine prize until 1933. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has dominated in the past 20 years, with <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> becoming the 31st and 32nd Americans to win. During that time, there have been 20 laureates from other countries. Last year's medicine winner was <PERSON> Susumu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonegawa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for his study of the body's immune system at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. The Nobels were first awarded in 1901 as a stipulation in the will of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, the Swedish industrialist who made a fortune on his invention of dynamite. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize, announced Sept. 29 in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Egyptian novelist <PERSON> Naguib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahfouz </PERSON> last week becamethe first Arabic-language literature laureate. The economics prize is to be announced Tuesday and chemistry and physics on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Bath Iron Works To Pay Only $650,000 Of $4.2 Million Fine</HEAD>

 Bath Iron Works will pay only a fraction of a record $ 4.2 million fine for alleged health and safety violations under the terms of a settlement announced Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Bath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 650,000 in fines by January, to correct any outstanding violations by April and to drop any legal challenges to the actions by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` This settlement reflects <ORGANIZATION> BIW </ORGANIZATION>'s acknowledgment that some violations did exist and its commitment to implement action where further improvements were needed,'' company Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON> told reporters at the shipyard. `` The company also believes the dramatic fine reduction and elimination of -LRB- violations categorized as willful -RRB- is a significant vindication of <ORGANIZATION> BIW </ORGANIZATION>'s employees and the shipyard's past operational practices.'' An <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the agency's regional headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said it agreed to the 85 percent reduction in the fine because of the company's willingness to accept the terms of the settlement. `` <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> is not terribly interested in the money,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> is interested in the health and safety of the workers.'' The shipbuilders union, which had initially vowed to oppose any reduction, applauded the settlement Monday. The company and union `` now must concentrate our efforts on compliance and safety rather than needless litigation,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Stoney'' <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON>, a spokesman for Local 6 of the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Shipbuilding Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Bath Iron Works, a major contractor for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Aegis cruiser and destroyer programs, is the state's largest private employer with more than 10,000 workers. Last November, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> proposed the original $ 4.2 million fine against Bath Iron Works for underreporting employee injuries and illnesses which allegedly occurred between January 1985 and May 1987. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> also cited the presence of asbestos-laden dust at the shipyard and inadequate testing of toxic concentrations of the dust. The company denied trying to hide or misrepresent worker-injury records and appealed the fine, which was the largest penalty <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has ever levied against a single company.
