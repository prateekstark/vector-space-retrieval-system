 The Sandinista government on Tuesday freed 29 peasants accused of collaborating with U.S.-backed rebels _ the first of about 1,200 prisoners <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has promised to release. The 29 were freed from a city jail in this northern town. `` This should coincide with the beginning of the demobilization of the Contras -LRB- rebels -RRB- from <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> territory and the withdrawal of those who operate in Nicaraguan territory,'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. He said there will be no mercy for rebel groups who do not disband in compliance with the peace agreement signed last week in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and four other Central American presidents. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke at a cermony during the release of the 29 in <LOCATION> Pantasma </LOCATION>, 140 miles north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` He who does not accept the hand we are extending should be prepared,'' he said. Under the agreement signed at the summit conference in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the rebels are to disband by early December. An estimated 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents will be moved from camps along the Honduran border and resettled in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, under the accords. The government said recently there are about 2,500 Contras operating in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In return for the disbanding of the rebels the government has pledged to hold free and fair elections in February. It would be the first free vote since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> defeated the conservative government of President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and gained power in July 1979. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the rebels `` have the opportunity to contribute to peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'' and `` avoid more suffering for their families.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreed to a request from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> and Cattlemen to release about 1,200 peasants accused of aiding the rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Tuesday that 1,515 rebels and 39 former national guardsmen in the Somoza regime are in Nicaraguan prisons. The government freed 1,897 former guardsmen on March 17. The leftis government has announced monthly cease-fires in its war against the rebels since June 1988, when a temporary truce between the two sides expired. Pantasma is located in a northern valley the rebels tried to take numerous times but failed. In October 1983, 48 peasants died in the fighting.

<HEAD>The American Jeep Is Mark of Prestige to Japanese 4WD Enthusiasts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOTOSU, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Japanese have gone wild over four-wheel drive vehicles and on that score they have shed their prejudices against American automobiles. The American-made Jeep is the mark of prestige. Churning up mud, bouncing over dirt moguls, mucking through boggy sinkholes, enthusiasts careen around a 5.5-acre four-wheel-drive playground in the shadow of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuji </LOCATION>. The equivalent of a ski resort for dirt vehicles, the pay-by-the-day <LOCATION> Motosu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> course is flourishing because herds of four-wheel-drive vehicles were banned from tearing up <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuji </LOCATION> itself. But the four-wheel-drive vehicle also has become a status symbol in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s high-fashion <LOCATION> Harajuku </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where urban dandies cruise around in chrome-trimmed, jacked-up, jeep-type vehicles with the tops down, festooned with macho but unused heavy-duty winches and fog lights. And in affluent residential neighborhoods, housewives load groceries into Jeep Cherokees parked next to Mercedes Benzes and Saabs. In a country eager for ever-more-stylish ways to spend new-found cash, four-wheel-drive recreational vehicles have become the ultimate Japanese yuppie vehicle _ and the American Jeep is the one to own. While other American cars are deemed mediocre by the Japanese, Jeeps evoke an image of American wide-open spaces and outdoor life that many Japanese long for, says <PERSON> Nobuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON>, editor of 4X4 Magazine. Chrysler Jeep sales have doubled in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for three years in a row, but they still totaled only 500 in 1988. The vast majority of four-wheel-drive cars on Japanese roads are still domestic models, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> Pajero or Isuzu Big Horn. And many vehicles with the genuine Jeep insignia were built by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, which bought the technology from the <ORGANIZATION> Willis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> more than 20 years ago, before Jeep manufacturing was taken over in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and then <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. Four-wheel-drive vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s auto market. For the past few years jeep-type sales have grown 20 to 30 percent annually, or three times as fast as the entire car market, estimates <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON>. One in 11 of the 6.7 million cars produced in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year had four-wheel drive. Recreation vehicles are part of a growing leisure industry fueled by rising incomes and longer vacations. Skiers, surfers, and scuba divers also are avid drivers of jeep-style vehicles. But 75 percent of four-wheel-drives in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> never leave city streets: their appeal is atmospheric rather than functional. Jeep-style vehicles with power steering, leather seats, stereos, adjustable suspensions and automatic transmissions sell fast, and dealers say they're getting BMW trade-ins from buyers. The top-of-the-line <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jeep Cherokee costs about $ 35,000 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, more than double the price of many smaller Japanese jeep-style cars. `` This is really a luxury car, for well-to-do buyers, mostly professionals in their late 30s or 40s,'' says <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakamoto </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuroiwa </PERSON>, who has been selling Jeeps and Jeep parts for more than 20 years from a cluttered suburban garage, finds the fad a little ironic `` There's no need for these cars in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> nowadays,'' he said. `` There's hardly any place to really drive them. It's just a fashion, people like them with all kinds of shiny accessories stuck on. It's a way to spend money.'' <PERSON> Kuroiwa </PERSON> fell in love with Jeeps when they were the only vehicles that could get around in a devastated <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> just after World War II. As a child he admired the powerful olive-green vehicles driven by American occupation troops. After the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation forces left <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, their Jeeps continued to serve as all-round vehicles, especially on rough country roads, but they nearly disappeared in the 1960s, when many were shipped to poorer countries for another lifetime of service. Now <PERSON> Kuroiwa </PERSON> and others are buying vintage <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeeps </ORGANIZATION> as collectors items from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, where they are still widely in use. In <PERSON> Kuroiwa </PERSON>'s lot, <PERSON> Yuichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, 45, proudly pats the hood of his well-preserved Jeep, which is exactly as old as he is. `` It's won a lot of Jeep beauty contests,'' he said.

 He was a lawyer, investment banker, professor and editor _ and only 32 when the plane he was in crashed in the mountains of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. But friends remember <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillem </PERSON> as a selfless man who overcame a poor, troubled childhood to use his wealth to help others, especially the young _ from disadvantaged children in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to starving children in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` When everyone else was talking, he was out there doing,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnall </PERSON>, his roommate on a 1986 trip to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tillem </PERSON> was on the plane that crashed Aug. 7 in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, killing 16, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Tillem, an Orthodox Jew, had worked on behalf of Ethiopians, Jewish and otherwise, since 1986, helping establish a poultry-farming enterprise. `` You ca n't save the world, but you can save one corner of it _ and in <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>'s case, several corners,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribakove </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Ethiopian Jews. `` It was very typical of him, that helping <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> meant not just sitting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and writing checks, but going there, going to visit Jewish villages, putting drops in children's eyes.'' Tillem's resume looked like that of someone twice his age: chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; professor at <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Yeshiva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he was on the board of trustees; publisher and editor of the Jewish Almanac, which he subsidized to keep it affordable. `` It's hard to believe that one guy could do all these things,'' <PERSON> Schnall </PERSON> said. `` He used to say, ` I do n't have time to sleep. I've got things I've got to do.'' Among those things were establishing a scholarship fund for poor students at <ORGANIZATION> Yeshiva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and a fund for retarded and disadvantaged children at <ORGANIZATION> Ohel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` He had almost an obsession to make a difference,'' said longtime friend <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapps </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Law and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, where Tillem once practiced civil rights law. As <PERSON> Tillem </PERSON> wrote in his preface to the Jewish Almanac, `` hunger, despair, homelessness, blindness, deprivation, enslavement and hopelessness'' exist alongside `` tranquility, order and privilege,'' and Jews should work to improve the ratio. `` That is ` tikkun hoalam' _ repairing the world, for the world can and should be different than it is,'' he wrote. `` He listened to what others had to say and spoke quietly,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for Women. `` But he was so imaginative in his ideas. `` And all of them were directed toward solving problems of humanity _ social problems, political problems. He had ideas for the subways, for <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, for <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, for everybody.'' The money for all this came from canny investments. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>'s latest venture is <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a passenger airline out of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` He gave away most of his money,'' said <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON>, director for international affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Tillem seldom spoke of his childhood, friends said, though it was known his parents divorced and that he lived in a series of foster homes before a rabbi in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> took him in as a teen-ager. He was unmarried. `` You got the sense that he had a thing for children, that what happened to him would n't happen to anyone else,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Rapps </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a very strange and enigmatic fellow,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I do n't want to gloss this over. He was a loner, a restless, imaginative and tortured soul. And it was shaped by a very poor and traumatic childhood.''

 The farm crisis hot line is disconnected, but officials say farmers and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> advisers who help them are wiser because of Rural Route. The unique program ended this summer after 3,500 farmers called its toll-free number seeking confidential advice about their financial problems. Rural Route, which received $ 2.2 million in state and federal funds over four years, has left both farmers and advisers better prepared for the future, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloome </PERSON>, assistant director of the university <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have a vivid memory of a recent event that will make them more cautious,'' he said. Farmers also have learned that farming is a business and that they `` have a value and worth that has nothing to do with that occupation.'' Rural Route also taught university advisers to be aggressive in looking for solutions to farmers' economic problems, and preparing farmers for their future in agriculture or in some other occupation if necessary, said <PERSON> Bloome </PERSON>. `` Some wanted to pretend the men in trouble were older, poorly educated smaller farmers who were laggards at accepting technology,'' he said. `` The opposite was true. They were young, well-educated and progressive.'' The hot line was unplugged July 1, although the services remain available. `` Calls had dropped to one a day or less,'' said <PERSON> Bloome </PERSON>. `` The overall financial picture for farmers was much improved, and farmers' need for anonymity seemed to be less.'' When the first call came into Rural Route, on March 18, 1985, farm income was down, debt and operating costs were up, and many farmers felt a serious economic pinch. Bills _ and stress _ mounted. Foreclosure loomed for some. There was an increase in alcohol abuse, family discord, divorce and suicide. But many troubled farmers refused to seek help because of pride and fear of ridicule in their communities. Farmers were referred to counseling centers around the state, or advisers _ always from <LOCATION> another </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> _ were dispatched to their farms.

 A man arrested for kidnapping and killing a five-year-old girl confessed he killed two other girls in a series of brutal murders that have shocked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, who was arrested Friday for kidnapping and killing <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomoto </PERSON> two months ago, confessed to police that he also killed two 4-year-old girls, <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Konno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Namba </PERSON>. Police were also grilling the 26-year-old <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> print shop worker regarding his possible involvement in the disappearance of a fourth girl, 7-year-old <PERSON> Masami </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshizawa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION> state, who vanished last October. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> was in custody after being arrested July 23 for allegedly taking nude photographs of a 6-year-old girl. He was charged with indecent assault in the case. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> was re-arrested Friday on charges of kidnapping and killing <PERSON> Nomoto </PERSON>, who he told police `` made fun of a deformity'' in his hands. Her torso was found near a public restroom in a cemetery northwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on June 11. Police discovered the girl's skull Thursday at a location <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> led them to. Under Japanese law, prosecutors have a maximum of 20 days to collect evidence against him before releasing him or bringing charges. `` In the most brutal murder case in postwar crime history, <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> finally confessed he killed the other two,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported. The new development appeared on the front pages of all the major Japanese papers. Reporters have been camping out in front of <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>'s house, as well as the victims' homes. In his confession statement, <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> said, `` On Aug. 22, I picked up <PERSON> Mari </PERSON>, drove her to a mountain, where I strangled her to death. I took two pictures of her in the car. I burned her with other things in the front yard at my house. I put her bones and ashes in a box and put it at the front door of <PERSON> Mari </PERSON>'s home,'' the police reported the letter said. In February, after the box was found, letters were sent to <PERSON> Konno </PERSON>'s home and the national newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> by a writer named `` <PERSON> Yuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Imada </PERSON>,'' claiming responsibility for her abduction and murder. Investigators later found that `` <PERSON> Yuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Imada </PERSON>'' was a name of a female detective in a comic book. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> told police he also kidnapped <PERSON> Namba </PERSON>, strangling her in his car, stripping her clothes off and throwing her in the woods, police said. <PERSON> Mitsuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maniwa </PERSON>, a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Shizuoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> could not distinguish between reality and the fictional world largely due to his fascination with horror and animation videos. <PERSON> Susumu </PERSON> <PERSON> Oda </PERSON>, a mental health expert at <ORGANIZATION> Tsukuba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> described the series of abductions as `` murder for pleasure.'' `` This case involved abnormal sexual desires, especially toward little girls, sadism, obsession for dead bodies and objects,'' <PERSON> Oda </PERSON> said.

 This communist land of comparative plenty, long a magnet for Soviet bloc citizens seeking consumer goods and comfortable vacations, also is becoming an escape route to the West. On Sunday night, a dozen young East Germans who spent the weekend outside the West German consulate in hopes of reaching the West crawled into their sleeping bags for another night on the sidewalk. Police drove by now and then, but did not disturb them. Across the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a new <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> committee was examining requests for refugee status from 10 applicants: a Soviet citizen, a Czechoslovak and eight stranded Somalis. Three refugee camps for 1,400 people are being built outside <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. They are primarily intended for ethnic Hungarians from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, but officials say the camps will be open to all Europeans who can prove they face persecution at home. One of the young East Germans said: `` We still do n't know whether we'll make it, but the way West is a lot easier from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> than from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began welcoming Romanian refugees in January 1988, breaking an agreement with the communist ally to return its citizens who sought asylum. About 17,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the first instance of one <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country giving sanctuary to citizens of another on grounds of persecution. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s decision to take in refugees from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> put a further burden on the already strained relations between the two allies. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has long maintained the estimated 1.7 million-member ethnic Hungarian minority in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is subject to discriminatory policies. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> also has expressed concern over a Romanian plan to demolish villages and resettle the population. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> fears that this could destroy ethnic culture and traditions. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> rejects the charges as interference in its internal affairs. Hungarian officials said in recent interviews the country will not change its new border and refugee policies just to avoid tensions with allies. In May, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling barbed wire and other barriers on its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Since then, at least 1,500 East Germans with few chances of travel to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have tried to cross into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> illegally through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Hundreds succeeded and have gone on to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Other hundreds who failed have gone underground in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> or sought asylum on West German diplomatic property. Police Col. <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> urged all people who are in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> illegally to leave, but also told reporters none would be `` forcibly deported.'' A government official said privately: `` Because this decision expands the possibility for the East Germans to go to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> illegally, it's clear that this decision is not among those that the East Germans are happy about.'' The new refugee policy, which could provide asylum to any East European who proved persecution, is likely to disturb <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s East European allies even more. On March 14, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first Soviet bloc country to join the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> on the Rights of Refugees, which took effect June 12. It commits authorities not to return anyone to a country where his `` life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality ... or political opinion.'' Some Western countries have applied the convention broadly, giving asylum to most citizens of Soviet bloc countries. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> insists <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> does not want to become a conduit to the West, but officials formulating new laws to conform with the convention say all cases will be heard. `` If an individual meets the criteria of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> convention, then we will definitely grant him refugee status, because if we decided to accept something we have to carry it through,'' said <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, deputy head of the ministry's refugee section. `` I can not speak for the Czechoslovak or East German governments, but in case they disapprove, what can we do?'' Under new laws taking effect in October, each applicant will be heard by a refugee camp panel, <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> said. A refugee who is rejected may appeal to an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> committee, then demand a court hearing. <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> said other countries of permanent residence would be sought for most refugees other than ethnic Hungarians, indicating most would come from the East and go West. `` It's clear that not too many Swiss citizens are going to ask for refugee status from us,'' he said, and smiled.

<TEXT>
 Six months after the Soviet military withdrawal, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> remains in power, the U.S.-backed guerrillas who oppose him are feuding and both superpowers are increasing arms deliveries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have said they want a political settlement of the 11-year-old civil war, but talks in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> two weeks ago produced no breakthrough and summer fighting has continued. When the last Soviet troops crossed the <LOCATION> Oxus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> border Feb. 15, journalists in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> awaited the imminent arrival of the Moslem guerrillas, as predicted by Western diplomats who had closed their embassies and left. Six months later, with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in office and his communist government denying rumors of an attempted coup in July, there is no expectation of guerrillas capturing <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> or any key provincial capital. Western embassies remain closed, however. Soviet bloc and Asian diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> say that is more indicative of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to reaching a deal with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> than to fear of the rockets that fall on the city almost daily. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses only one name, has proved his government can defend itself and is not the kind of Soviet `` puppet'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expected to fall. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has offered to hold elections, under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision, for a broad-based coalition government but insists his party participate. The guerrillas reject that participation. `` We want a political settlement,'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. `` War brings nothing but the killing of innocent civilians and further destruction of our country. The war option can not solve anything.'' Rockets are a daily threat in this mile-high capital ringed by mountains. Some unofficial estimates say they hit civilian targets 98 percent of the time and military targets only 2 percent. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said 281 people were killed and 745 wounded, nearly all civilians, by rockets and a car bombing between June 25 and Aug. 1. Residents generally blame the rockets on the guerrillas and on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which pays for them, but more and more they also are holding the government and Soviets responsible. `` Both sides buy rockets and we hate both of them,'' said <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, an 18-year-old student, as he walked through rubble that had been a friend's home. `` I think now it's time the great powers, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, must accept some type of solution for Afghanistann'' said <PERSON> Esmatee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, president of the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed to act as guarantors of the U.N.-mediated accords of April 1988 between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which provided for withdrawal of Soviet soldiers and an end to outside involvement. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet forces entered the country in December 1979. Each side has accused the other of interfering. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is shipping arms to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government at the rate of $ 2.5 billion to $ 3 billion a year, nearly double the figure before the withdrawal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has promised the guerrillas new weapons with which to disable airport runways and counter high-altitude bombing by the Afghan air force. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> of the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> said last week the Soviets were supplying with new MiG-29 fighters and the latest Sukhoi-27 ground attack jets to defend against a possible Pakistani attack. At least 3 million Afghans have fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s eastern neighbor, which <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government accuses of direct involvement in the war Guerrillas use border cities and refugee camps as bases and supply points. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to the guerrillas appointed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, predicted a major guerrilla offensive during the fighting season, which lasts until November, but it has not materialiized. `` The end is clear,'' he told a congressional committee last month. `` Resistance will prevail.'' <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> said little of the guerrillas' failure to capture the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> after months of siege, and an attack July 9 by one of the seven guerrilla groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on another. Members of the <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s group <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, which has received the most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, were reported to have killed 30 field commanders and fighters of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>. Compounding the effections of factionalism has been the reluctance of some field commanders to fight. Some say they resent not being included in the exile government formed earlier this year and are unwilling to risk their men for it. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has emphasized national reconciliation, offering autonomy to local commanders who make peace will him. On Monday, he met with 60 former guerrillas who came over to the government and said: `` Those who were fighting come together, just like two brothers beside each other.'' The government has yet to win over any major guerrilla commanders. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Monday the security belt around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was being extended to prevent long-range rockets from reaching the city. He said the zone, now about 20 miles, would be enlarged to between 25 miles and 40 miles, depending on terrain. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the government expected the guerrillas to start using long-rante rockets. Those now in use have ranges of 20 miles or less.

 A giant, 18-foot-long alligator is living in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, boaters and fishermen claim, but a state wildlife expert says he doubts it. `` It looks monstrous, bigger than our boat, and we have a 19-footer,'' <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, who has been fishing on the lake with her fishing-guide husband since 1966, said recently. `` We see it all the time,'' said <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, who said she believes the alligator is a female. `` She throws her food up in the air, way up, then catches and eats it, mostly fish and birds.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> has named the alligator <PERSON> Hendrietta </PERSON>, for <LOCATION> Hendry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, one of five counties surrounding <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, which is about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and at 700 square miles is <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest lake Bass fisherman <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said he saw the creature sunning itself on shore with its tail curled around itself like <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Godiva </PERSON>'s hair. <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said that when he took his boat closer to the gator, he kept repeating, `` Oh, my God, that alligator is long. Nobody's going to believe this.'' When he got within about 200 yards of the big reptile, it started swimming toward his 18-foot boat. It `` was all of my boat's size,'' <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> recalled. An 18-foot alligator would break <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s longest alligator record by nearly 4 feet. However, wildlife biologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> of the state Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> said an 18-foot-long alligator would be highly improbable. The longest gator caught since records were first kept in 1977 measured just over 14 feet and weighed 714 pounds, and was trapped last month in the <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> southwest of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. Trappers estimated it was 100 years old. The heaviest gator, caught in April near <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, weighed 1,043 pounds and was 13 feet long. It took a tow truck to lift it and three scales to weigh it. `` That was a very healthy gator,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` I would've questioned it, if I had n't seen it myself. The giant gator's real length may be determined after Sept. 1, when <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s monthlong alligator season starts. `` Every hunter who has a permit will be going for him,'' said <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>'s 22-year-old son, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>.

The four representatives of the tournament teams _ <ORGANIZATION> N.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> _ gave brief speeches Monday to start the news conference.

 The opposition and government held a third round of talks Monday on the country's political crisis in an attempt to resolve the impasse over whether Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will step down and who will govern the country after Sept. 1. The opposition is demanding that its victory in the May 7 presidential elections be recognized so it can take power when the current terms of acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and the legislature expire at the end of August. It also wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish his post as chief of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which makes him the country's de facto leader. International observers said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the election annulled when it became apparent the opposition was winning. He has resisted more than a year of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and opposition pressure for his ouster, ever since he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in 1988 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The opposition on Monday however refused a government proposal that the two sides join in demanding an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maneuvers along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethancourt </PERSON>, head of the government delegation to the talks. No reason for the opposition refusal was given. Last week there were at least 10 incidents between <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. An Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mission that is mediating the talks is to present another progress report on Aug. 23.

 A police detective haunted for years by the supposedly accidental death of a 17-month-old boy is resting easier since his reopening of the case led to the arrest of the boy's stepfather for murder The suspicious death of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walford </PERSON> nine years ago was particularly troubling to Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> because <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> was virtually the same age as his own son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>. `` I guess over the years I've always thought about <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walford </PERSON> never getting a chance to grow up and do the things <PERSON> David </PERSON> has done,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a 16-year veteran of the police force in the eastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION>. On Aug. 19, 1980, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walford </PERSON> died of severe head injuries suffered at his home. Despite indications of abuse, the death was ruled an accident. A new investigation started by <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> led to the arrest Saturday of the boy's stepfather, <PERSON> Gurney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON>. The 38-year-old truck driver posted $ 25,000 bond and was released on a charge of second-degree murder. <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> is scheduled to appear Wednesday in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. Nine years ago, then-Sgt. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was one of two detectives assigned to investigate the child's death. <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> told detectives he was in the house with <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> when he heard a thud. He said the boy had fallen off a 3 -LCB- - inch step in a doorway between two rooms After <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> telephoned for help, the boy was taken to a <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> hospital where he died three days later. Just a few days before, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> had been taken to an <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION> hospital emergency room for an ankle injury. He also had numerous bruises, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. Police, a doctor and relatives all suspected the boy's injuries were not an accident. But <LOCATION> Sedgwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> forensics pathologist Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON> somehow had been given a wrong description of <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON>'s story. When he performed the autopsy, he ruled that <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>'s injuries probably were caused by the type of accident he believed <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> had described. The county attorney decided there was n't enough evidence to prosecute and the case was closed. Authorities would not say what description the pathologist was given because prosecutors plan to use it as evidence in the trial. In 1986, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> received permission to reopen the investigation. He reinterviewed dozens of people, including the boy's grandparents and mother, who was at work when the injury occurred. The mother, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Craver </PERSON>, subsequently divorced <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> and remarried and now lives in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` The entire family suspected abuse from the very beginning. I think that's what led to the divorce,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Craver </PERSON> has been `` very supportive and felt something had happened to her son, and did want the investigation open,'' he said. Investigators also uncovered a new witness _ a longtime friend of <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> who told officers that <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> told her he was disciplining <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> when the injury occurred. Finally, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Symmonds </PERSON> decided to view the boy's autopsy, which had been videotaped as a training exercise. It was something <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had avoided doing the first time around. `` I just did not want to see a 17-month-old cut up,'' he said. `` I should have done it, though. That was my job.'' The viewing proved crucial, showing that <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON> had been given wrong information. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> contacted <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON>, and after reviewing the evidence the pathologist changed his mind. His new report blamed the boy's fatal injuries on an `` assaultive scenario.'' `` I ca n't explain the feeling I got inside of me when he called it a homicide,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` All these years, I knew it was a homicide, and now I had an expert forensic pathologist calling it a homicide.'' Armed with that report, confirmation from two other pathologists and the new witness, the county attorney decided to prosecute <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> for second-degree murder. `` I'm just ready to put it to sleep and let <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walford </PERSON> rest,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I can just put this file someplace and not have to look at it again.''

<HEAD>Minorities Under-Represented in AIDS Treatments, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many minorities infected with the AIDS virus are not seeking new life-prolonging treatments because of a lack of information and distrust of the medical establishment, doctors and social workers say. Poor blacks and Hispanics are under-represented in AIDS clinical trials where experimental therapies are tested, and they often do n't seek treatment until they are sick enough to qualify for free medical care, said AIDS caseworkers attending a government conference on AIDS and minorities `` They're not as well-educated about prevention and they do n't have a cousin who is a doctor who can tell them about the latest drug that's being tested in a clinical trial in their area,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an assistant attending physician in obstetrics and gynecology at <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> Also, the poor are often suspicious of attempts to get them into medical research, she said. Many hear only that the treatments, like AZT, make patients sick and do n't understand that the drug can cripple the AIDS virus, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, also a clinical instructor at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. One way to include more minorities in clinical trials would be to move the trials out of the academic medical centers and into the neighborhoods, many conference participants said Monday. Because much of the research on new drugs is being conducted at universities, clinical trials are often set up in a way that excludes poor people, said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cylar </PERSON>, a clinical social worker and activist with the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unleash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, known as ACT UP. Often, services like transportation and day care are not considered, he said. `` Do n't put the trials on Madison Avenue or at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, put them in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>,'' he said. As of a month ago, 7,096 people with AIDS were participating in clinical trials sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the chief AIDS research institute at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Among them were 557 blacks, 731 Hispanics and 427 women. AIDS activists helped start the move to community-based testing, and the federal government is preparing to distribute $ 6 million in the fall to groups that want to expand or begin such programs. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, an AIDS services worker from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attending the conference, dismissed the often-heard reasons researchers give for excluding women and intravenous drug users, the fastest growing segment of AIDS cases, from clinical trials: They are unreliable because they do n't always show up for treatments. `` Well, are they not coming in because they're at their methadone clinic? That's a very valid place for them to be,'' she said. `` Did the woman not come in because her child was sick? `` Those concepts of non-compliance are often covers for our poor design based on having dealt with other middle-class people who can plan ahead and are in control of their lives in terms of scheduling and resources,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, whose department is sponsoring the conference, told the opening session that the government and local communities must do a better job targeting AIDS prevention messages to minorities. He said the messages must be `` culturally relevant and sensitive,'' but he added that `` community standards must be respected'' in educating about the disease that is often transmitted through sexual contact. As of July 31, the total number of Americans diagnosed with AIDS reached 102,621, of whom 59,391 have died since July 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Blacks, who comprise 12 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, represent 26 percent of adult AIDS cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 53 percent of pediatric cases, he said. Hispanics, who make up 7 percent of the nation's population, represent 15 percent of adult cases and 23 percent of pediatric cases.

<TEXT>
 Industrialist Armand Hammer, pardoned by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for making illegal campaign contributions to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s 1972 campaign, says the president's action reinforces his faith in the American legal system. White House spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> confirmed Monday night that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had pardoned the 91-year-old Hammer and nine other people whose names were not released. The White House usually does not announce its action on pardons. Hammer, who pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976, released news of his pardon in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Having spent my lifetime fighting injustice, this vindication reinforces my abiding faith in the American system of justice,'' he said in a statement issued Monday through his <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I deeply appreciate President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action in clearing my name.'' Hammer spent several years seeking a pardon, and there had been speculation that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would grant one in his last days in office. Hammer originally pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to a criminal information filed by the Watergate special prosecutor to three misdemeanor charges of making $ 54,000 in illegal contributions to the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> campaign. But the judge threw out the plea after <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> wrote a 20-page letter to his probation officer blaming former <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vice president, for the contributions. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> was convicted of concealing that Hammer was the true source of the money. In 1976, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> left a hospital bed in a wheelchair and hooked to a cardiac monitor to enter another plea in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> court. `` I'm pleading because I'm guilty,'' he told the judge at the time. Hammer was sentenced to a year's probation and fined $ 3,000. The judge said he spared Hammer a prison sentence because of his precarious health. Hammer was a self-made millionaire by the time he graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at 23, having taken over his father's pharmaceutical business four years earlier. After graduation, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to negotiate a business deal, and wound up with a concession for an asbestos mine and a pencil factory. Proud of having met every Soviet leader since <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> has devoted much of his fortune to collecting great art, research on cancer and promoting world peace. Hammer's money sent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> physicians to treat victims of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1986.

<HEAD>Farm Machinery Sales Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Better times on the farm are boosting sales of new tractors and other machinery, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. Another reason for the increased sales is the relative scarcity of good used machines. For years, because of tight finances, farmers had to do with what they had. Thus, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, many farmers who might be in the used market are turning to new models. `` Sales in all categories of new farm machinery are expected to expand in 1989,'' the agency said in a report. `` Farmers appear to be continuing a trend toward using larger tractors.'' Analysts said sales of four-wheel-drive tractors are expected to grow the most this year, up 65 percent from 1988, followed by a 23 percent increase for the larger two-wheel-drive models, those of more than 139 horsepower. Sales of combine harvesters and hay balers are also expected to gain about 22 percent each this year. Overall, farmers are forecast to spend $ 6.2 billion to $ 6.7 billion on machinery this year, the third consecutive annual increase, report said. Last year's expenditures rose to $ 6.03 billion from less than $ 5.8 billion in 1987 and $ 4.6 billion in 1986. Machinery sales rose to a record of almost $ 12 billion in 1979 before sliding seven consecutive years to the 1986 level. `` Weather conditions weakened sales growth in 1988, but are not expected to play a significant role this year,'' the report said. `` Higher net cash income, lower real interest rates, and reductions in outstanding debt began boosting farm machinery expenditures in 1987 and will continue to increase sales through 1989.'' Rising land values also are improving farmers' financial standings, enabling them to replace aging farm machinery. Another factor this year is a larger planted acreage, triggered in part by last year's drought-reduced harvests and rising market prices of some of the major commodities. `` An expansion in planted acres increases the return a farmer receives from the machine, because it is used on more acres,'' the report said. `` Furthermore, greater planted acreage makes machine down time more costly because more acres must be worked within the same time frame.''

 A defensive war against Africanized honeybees has helped slow the northward march of the insects across <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. Popularly called `` killer bees'' by some, including movie writers, the migrating bees were expected to reach the southern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987 or 1988. Then, maybe 1989 or 1990. But department officials now say the bees wo n't reach the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` for another 18 months or later.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that a joint project with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has delayed the bees' arrival and `` should give researchers and beekeepers enough time to study the bee and learn how to manage it.'' The Africanized honeybee is the hybrid offspring of European honeybees and pure African queen bees brought to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1956 for research. The African queens escaped and began interbreeding with native honeybees. Africanized bees have been migrating northward since then and were found in southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1986. Today, they are about 400 miles south of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border near <LOCATION> Tecolutla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Although the venom of Africanized bees is no more potent than that of the European bees that are common throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the hybrids can be more dangerous because of their aggressiveness and the likelihood of them stinging in greater numbers. Besides the notoriety as a fierce pest around humans and animals, the Africanized honeybee also is feared by many commercial beekeepers for what it might do to their industry. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said his agency began working with the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government two years ago in a cooperative program to control the Africanized bees. The program includes the detection and tracking of the bees as they near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border; trapping and destruction of swarms to reduce their numbers; and efforts to alter the bees genetically to they pose less of a threat. `` Program personnel in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have hung almost 60,000 traps in the last 18 months and have caught more than 11,000 swarms of Africanized bees,'' <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said. `` That's millions of Africanized bees that will never reach the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The project in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also uses `` requeening'' to reduce the transfer of Africanized traits to regular honeybee colonies. Beekeepers are encouraged to select queens from desirable genetic stock and mark them with a bright paint so that it's easy to tell if they are in the hive. If an unmarked queen is noted, that female is replaced with a marked queen known to be of good genetic stock.

 A quarterly report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the number of workers employed by farmers showed a seasonal increase in July, but dropped slightly from a year ago. The hired work force on farms was estimated at 1,197,000 during the week of July 9-15, up from 830,000 in April. In July 1988, the work force was 1,200,000. That did not include 351,000 `` agricultural service'' workers provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In April, those totaled 198,000 workers, and in July 1988 they were estimated at 303,000. Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $ 5.23 per hour, up from $ 4.90 per hour a year earlier but below the average of $ 5.35 in April, the report said. For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage rate available. However, workers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were reported at $ 5.80 per hour, compared with $ 6.45 in April and $ 5.74 a year earlier in July 1988. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> workers averaged $ 5.55 per hour, compared with $ 6.24 in April and $ 5.19 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Eastern Agrees to $75,000 Fine on Consumer Charges</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are changing some of their business procedures after agreeing to pay a $ 75,000 fine for alleged federal consumer violations. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the financially hobbled carrier agreed to pay the civil penalty `` to avoid costly litigation,'' but was not conceding guilt. The alleged violations occurred in 1986 and 1987. It could take the government years to pocket the funds, however, because <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been under the protection of federal bankruptcy laws since March 9, five days after the strike against the carrier began. When a bankruptcy judge approves a schedule for repaying creditors, the payments might take years. The DOT charged the airline with taking more than the required seven days to issue credit-card refunds to customers. It also accused Eastern of not informing some consumers that flights listed by the carrier were operated by independent commuter airlines with agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern officials said little about the settlement. But spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the company had `` changed our procedures to better comply with DOT regulations.'' DOT officials said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> uses an express delivery service to speed the shipment of refund claims to its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a $ 325,000 fine in November 1987, the largest ever. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ agreed to pay a $ 250,000 penalty for similar charges in June 1987. Eastern filed a reorganization plan with the federal bankruptcy court July 21. Its goal is to emerge from reorganization by the end of this year. Under the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION>, the government would receive its payment after all creditors have been repaid but before <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s debts to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> are repaid. If the agreement is n't approved by the court by Nov. 30, it would be voided and the government would have to renew its efforts to press its case against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Podberesky </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> assistant general counsel, said the fine could be repaid in the next few months or could be delayed until sometime in the 1990s. Typically, he said, fines levied against financially healthy airlines are paid within anywhere from 15 days to two years. Claims against carriers in bankruptcy can take years, he said. Eastern, which operated 1,100 flights daily before the strike, operated 350 flights Monday and planned to increase that to 390 Tuesday, <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said.

 Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s crusade against hunger will live on despite his death, says <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, but there appears to be no obvious successor to carry the torch. `` There will be a determination on the part of members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to work for those goals that <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> sought to achieve _ the alleviation of hunger and suffering here and in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the world,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Monday. However, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., did n't say who would become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, the panel <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> founded in 1984 <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, died in a plane crash last week while on a fact-finding mission in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said a new committee chairman was not expected to be named until next month when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from a month-long recess. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s efforts were credited with getting $ 800 million in relief for victims of famine in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Whenever a member wanted to do something -LRB- on hunger -RRB- they would go to him,'' <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsoyannis </PERSON>, chief of staff of the hunger committee, said Monday. `` This committee served as a focus. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> became more sensitive as a result.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> parceled out responsibilities and several members of the committee were leaders in specific areas, <PERSON> Katsoyannis </PERSON> said. The senior member is Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who shared <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s concern for hunger in the Third World Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, another committee member, was one of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s closest associates and among the first to go to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to strengthen search efforts last week. Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, is known for his work with the hungry of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, while Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON>, D-Miss., has been a leader in nutrition efforts among the rural poor of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, is known for his work on hunger problems among the Hispanic poor. Seniority rules do n't apply to select committee chairmanships which, like standing committees, are made by the speaker. Select committees do n't act on legislation, but do initiate studies, hold hearings and influence other committees to make changes or additions to the federal statutes. `` Select committees at their best, offer us a flexibility and a sense of focus that we may otherwise not find in our standing committees,'' House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said during debate in February on whether to continue the committees. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said during the same debate that his committee's work was extensive during the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Thirty-two hearings, nine basic human needs seminars and numerous briefings were held; nine reports were published and monthly status reports on international and domestic hunger were issued and widely distributed,'' he said. The House Select Committee on Hunger was instrumental in setting up the Child Survival Fund, part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign assistance program. It also provided impetus to expanded research into the effects of vitamin A on child mortality.

<HEAD>Congressmen Seek to Curb Pentagon in Rulings on Exports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are making a new bid to curb the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s power to stop exports of high-technology goods, but defense officials say the limits are needed to keep equipment out of communist hands. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., and others say the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should oversee shipments of goods with both military and civilian uses, as long as the goods are not being sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or other Communist-ruled countries `` I think it makes sense,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., who heads the subcommittee on international trade in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I ca n't commit myself now, but I ` ll be glad to look at a proposal.'' Supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the issue include Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., and Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereuter </PERSON>, Members interested in changing the trade rules worry that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is overzealous in blocking exports. They see <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business losing sales to foreign competitors when more sales are needed to reduce the trade deficit. At the current rate, the trade deficit will be $ 111 billion this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, however, has told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> its work on export licenses has `` resulted in denial of license application to known diverters in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> countries, at an estimated value of approximately $ 200 million.'' Sensitive goods shipped to allies have sometimes reached Soviet hands. The Japanese government found that <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had sold the Soviets sophisticated machinery capable of silencing submarine propellers. At one point, some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> showed their anger by destroying a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> radio with hammers on the Capitol lawn. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from vacation next month, <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> and other advocates of the change will sound out opinion in both Houses. <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> represents a district where there are many high-technology companies. The new effort in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not keep the Pentagon out of decisions on exports that go directly to communist-ruled countries, or on exports of purely military goods. The countries on which the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would continue to have its say include <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted last year to let the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> oversee exports to non-communist countries of technology with non-military uses, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would not go along. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> won a decision from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against the Pentagon last month on a similar issue, enabling American manufacturers to ship higher-powered computers to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as well as to other countries _ despite public opposition from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` We did have a difference inside the administration on this question,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at the time. `` This will not endanger the legitimate national security needs of this country.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, pledging to keep talking to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> despite deep policy differences, says it aims for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> agreement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that promotes Palestinian political rights. A conciliatory statement issued Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> sought to repair the recent rift between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group while also urging the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to approve an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> election plan. The statement by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeks a settlement based on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> giving up territory in exchange for peace. Also listed as `` firm principles'' in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement were `` security and recognition for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> political rights.'' The statement did not say how those rights would be expressed. `` Our immediate task ... is to find a practical means to translate these principles into political reality,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> demands a state on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy opposes statehood, and would have <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Palestinians negotiate an arrangement acceptable to both sides. `` The Palestinians should have a chance to determine their own future in negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as to run their daily affairs,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, pledged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would keep talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to try to get negotiations started. `` We do n't expect a breakthrough in each particular meeting,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said in announcing that the talks begun last December had resumed in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. `` It's an ongoing process.'' The department last month accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of attaching unacceptable conditions to its provisional approval of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for elections on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. One was the demand for statehood. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supports the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal to choose elected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives for negotiations as the best way to get talks started. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, however, has denounced the proposal as a ploy to block Palestinian statehood. Last week, the department again criticized <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said a statement adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, raised questions about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s `` commitment to accommodation, understanding and peace.'' Delegates to a <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> maintains its headquarters, had approved a resolution calling for `` intensification of the armed struggle and all other forms of battle to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.'' On Monday, the department took a different approach through both spokesman <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> and envoy <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> had met in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation headed by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON> and again sought `` a positive Palestinian response'' to the Israeli election proposal. `` We continue to believe that through an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue progress can be achieved in moving the process forward to elections and peace negotiations,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, while disapproving of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, proposed elections to select Palestinians who would negotiate temporary and limited self-rule with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. After five years, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would negotiate an overall settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute. The lengthy statement by <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> called Monday's session `` serious and probing'' while offering assurances to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration seeks to foster political rights for Palestinians. `` There is a road to peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' it said. `` We are suggesting that the next, but not the last, milestone on that road is an election in the occupied territories.'' In <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON> said he expected the discussions to continue in `` the near future'' and said an international peace conference was `` the best introduction to establish an effective peace.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is upset that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ignored two high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals to change its plans to test a long-range missile that passed near the Hawaiian islands. `` There was no danger, but there is always a risk, however slight,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday after Friday's 8,000-mile flight of an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile was disclosed. The missile did n't pass over land while flying over the island chain, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the point of the complaint was that `` it was too close for comfort.'' The missile was launched from the Tyuratam installation deep in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and splashed down some 1,250 miles south of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, officials said. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the missile had passed over waters between two tiny Hawaiian islands, <PERSON> Neckar </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nihoa </LOCATION>. A third official confirmed that the Soviets conducted the test Friday despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals that it posed potential political and safety problems. The Soviets announced Aug. 7 that they intended to conduct a test between Aug. 11 and Aug. 21, but neither of the two private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals to Deputy Ambassador <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetverikov </PERSON> nor the test itself were made public. `` It's somewhat disturbing the Soviets did n't take our concerns into account,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday. `` There was no danger, but there is always a risk, however slight, it might be that something would go awry. That is why we felt it was inappropriate.'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> and his deputy, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON>, held separate meetings last Monday and Tuesday with <PERSON> Chetverikov </PERSON> to complain that the missile was likely to pass over the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> chain before splashing down in the ocean. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> are the senior officers in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> and Canadian Affairs. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government expressed its deep concern to the Soviets over the planned test and asked that it be modified,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Chetverikov </PERSON> returned to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to say the test would be conducted strictly over water, not over any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. He said it would involve only international airspace and water. `` We did not find that response persuasive or sufficient, because the Soviet missile test would pass over the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> chain,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It is not a legal issue but an issue of political and safety considerations.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, whose tenure marked a steady expansion in U.S.-Sino relations until the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, is ending his tour with meetings and parties. Clues to how the administration and corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> view <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> two months after troops marched into <LOCATION> Tianamen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> may be found in the attendance at Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s farewell reception at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> has invited an array of officials, businessmen, academic experts and diplomats. China-watchers will size up the representation and observe which members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, on vacation for the August recess, return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the affair. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after the <LOCATION> Tianamen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> massacre that relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were important and that dialogue would continue in the hope that Chinese leaders would end repression. However, the president said it would not be `` business as usual,'' suspending military and top-level exchanges. Han, 65, has made farewell visits to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, four other Cabinet members and other senior officials. No meeting is scheduled with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> when he headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Han </PERSON>'s call on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> last Friday was `` strongly personal, based on a friendship that they've had for many, many years ... a one-on-one meeting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. The Chinese Embassy said <PERSON> Han </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` expressed a desire to preserve and develop'' U.S.-China relations. Han, in meetings with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials since June, has faithfully echoed his government's line condemning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of its pro-democracy crackdown as interference in internal <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> affairs. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S.-China relations had been moving ahead until June. But he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had continued to communicate with Han. `` How are you going to tell them you're upset about things if you do n't talk to them?'' he asked. `` Nothing has altered our dismay about events, but the way to express that view is to have contacts at a sufficient level so you know you're getting through.'' <PERSON> Han </PERSON> also paid farewell calls to Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other senior officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Supporters and detractors of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> agree his nomination as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> could define the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's response to the internationalization of financial markets. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday named <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, point man on the new multibillion-dollar plan to bail out the savings-and-loan industry, to head the five-member <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's an important member of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team. It seems to me that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has placed a high priority on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Polson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a national organization of state-level securities regulators. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> `` would be one who would be readily acceptable to the securities industry and one who would readily resolve the issues'' facing the industry. The White House announcement ended speculation about a successor for <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, who announced in May that he was stepping down. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> post requires <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the securities subcommittee, said the challenges faced by the commission include `` growing internationalization of financial markets and whether the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> will have adequate resources in the 1990s. `` I look forward to the committee's hearings on Mr. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, and to the opportunity they will afford to closely examine the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plans in a number of key areas,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said in a statement. Created in 1934 during the Depression, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> oversees securities markets and regulates the sale of stocks, bonds and other securities as part of its mission to keep the markets honest while protecting investors. Most recently, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> served as one of the architects of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L restructuring legislation, submitted in February, and guided it through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The final plan, a sweeping rewrite of banking laws and the largest single-industry government bailout, was signed into law by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week. Securities industry leaders and Republicans generally hailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice, but some <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats were less enthusiastic. `` I think it's a splendid appointment,'' said <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman under President Ford. `` It's going to be a very hard time at the commission in these next few years,'' said <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, now in private legal practice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The focus is going to be different. Our companies are going to seek capital abroad and foreign companies are going to be seeking capital here.'' Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also praised <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s intelligence and work on the savings and loan bailout but said, `` He brings a limited direct market experience to this critical assignment and that is a matter of some concern when the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> faces a time of epic challenge.'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, a 39-year-old lawyer and banking specialist, said through an aide he will not speak with reporters until after his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, whose job as presidential assistant for issues analysis made him something of a White House trouble shooter, also helped fashion administration policy for dealing with the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> was deputy counsel to Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from 1982 to 1985. Earlier, he was a securities specialist with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm, and between government assignments worked in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> law firm. He was also directed a task force on deregulation headed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president, and wrote the panel's report on the deregulation of financial services. But <PERSON> Polson </PERSON> said he saw no irony in a former deregulator's appointment to a major regulatory agency `` When Chairman <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> was picked, he was widely characterized as a deregulator, too,'' said <PERSON> Polson </PERSON> `` I do n't think it's useful in determining how he's going to perform as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he would nominate <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> to the commission seat held by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, whose term has expired. After <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would immediately designate <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> as the new chairman <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said Monday he plans to resign effective Sept. 30 unless <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> is confirmed before that. His resignation would create another vacancy on the commission.

<HEAD>Progress Made in Hostage Contacts: Fitzwater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says a breakthrough on negotiations for the release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> most likely is months away. `` We think generally the progress has been significant,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he would not equate progress on the diplomatic front with the eventual release of the hostages. `` Those two elements are a long way apart, so I would not compare the two,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had gleaned `` considerable amounts of information'' from contacts with other countries. Asked if information was being received from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, he replied, `` from all sources.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but has been communicating through third-party contacts, such as the Swiss government. Asked what he meant by `` significant'' progress, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We're not prepared to say, but -LRB- it is -RRB- in the general issue of understanding the problem better, improving relations and hopefully to get some kind of break down the road. `` I think we're looking at a long-term situation, months, not weeks.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined comment on a statement by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will never hold talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Shortly before <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> made his statement, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> renewed an offer to help free the hostages. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the contradictory statements `` typifies why we would not like to react to every comment that is made.''

 It was hardly a typical time capsule _ black vinyl packed with lipstick, makeup and old photos. It was a purse that had been stolen Oct. 18, 1970. Construction workers in an old department store being converted to apartments found the purse behind a storage cabinet last Wednesday. The money was gone, but there was an address book with some telephone numbers. After 18 years and 10 months, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had the purse she had long since given up for lost. Inside was her driving learner's permit, photos of her high school sweetheart and her high school girlfriends, her Social Security card, voter registration card and lipstick and makeup. `` It brought back memories,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who had been working in the department store when the purse was stolen. She said the thief took $ 60, her weekly pay. The bag apparently was tossed on the tall, wooden cabinet in the basement of the store. And there it stayed until the workers moved that cabinet.

The 26-year-old singer told <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> in its Sept. 4 issue that his voice, which is similar to his father's, from now on will be heard on songs that are `` a lot more raw and a lot more opinionated lyrically.'' `` I've used my shyness in the past to avoid issues and keep my opinions quiet. I'm not tired of being nice, but there is more to me than that,'' he said. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> hopes his third album, `` Mr. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>,'' will help him recover from his second album, `` The Secret Value of Daydreaming,'' which he called `` a disaster.'' <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s first album, `` Valotte,'' won him a Grammy nomination for best new artist. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> said that during the the 1986 release of `` Daydreaming'' he `` was pressured and contractually obligated to write a hit in a short period of time.'' Since then, he said, he changed management and stopped doing drugs. `` I'm not the dumb kid I was two years ago,'' he says. `` A lot of decisions had n't been made in my best interest, and I felt like I was being packaged. In one way, it was because of my ignorance and naivete. I have n't got a cent of what I earned from my first two albums.''

<HEAD>Judicial College Teaches Judges How to Better Fight War on Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Outrage over drug-related crime has spawned calls for more police and prisons, but a school for judges hopes to teach jurists to wage war on drugs with treatment rather than tough jail terms. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> is launching an instructional program to show judges how to handle criminals who have drug problems. `` There's an onslaught of drug-related cases coming into the courts right now across the country,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, assistant dean of the Reno-based institution. `` What we're trying to do is teach judges patterns of drug use and about evaluation and treatment programs so they do n't just order criminals to be locked up every time.'' One judge in each state has been invited to enroll in the inaugural one-week program, which begins Sunday, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. At least 44 judges selected by each state's chief judge plan to attend. The course will become a regular offering next March at the judicial college, whose alumni range from local judges to <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. The school offers short courses, mostly lasting one to four weeks. They range from basic instruction for new appointees to the bench, to retraining for experienced jurists. The private school, located on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> campus, is funded by state and federal grants, as well as tuition. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, one of the main instructors for next week's course, said he aims to teach jurists to recognize when it would be better to sentence a criminal to treatment instead of prison time. `` Neither the penitentiary nor probation by themselves are an adequate response to this country's drug crimes problems,'' <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for example, <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> said judges sometimes sentence non-violent criminals who have drug problems to residential or non-residential treatment programs along with community service. `` The recidivism rate for treatment programs is not as high as if you send them to prison,'' he said. `` From that point of view, these types of programs are a tremendous success.'' That message appears to stand in contrast to increasingly strident calls for tougher law enforcement. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> outlined the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's $ 1 billion crime-fighting package, including harsher penalties for the criminal use of guns, ending plea bargaining in such cases, hiring more investigators and prosecutors and doubling space in federal prisons. <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> said drug-using criminals who commit violent crimes must pay through incarceration. `` I'm not advocating that all drug offenders not go to prison,'' he said. `` But there are a significant number who ought to be placed in treatment programs rather than prisons.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>, 62 percent of the 605,000 people in state and federal prisons in 1988 used drugs regularly before they were incarcerated. Of those, 27 percent used drugs daily, according to <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunzeker </PERSON>, criminal justice program manager for the national lawmakers group. Twenty-two percent were under the influence of drugs while committing the crime for which they were sentenced to prison, she added. `` The studies show that drug use accelerates criminal behavior,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunzeker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, the assistant dean, said he hopes that by treating people for drug problems, crime can be reduced. `` Part of the solution to reducing the high crime rate is to find the problems and deal directly with them,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. `` The role of the judge will be to recognize when the problem is drugs.''

That does n't even count the Americans.'' <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> is doing media relations for a <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> reunion festival this weekend in nearby <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, and reporters made up a big part of the crowd at the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> site in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Besides reporters, about 200 people were camping at the site, <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratti </PERSON> said Monday. Campers strummed guitars, bought food from vendors and watched movies on videocassette recorders powered by portable generators. Police were expecting more people to arrive through the rest of the week in the town of about 3,000, but not too many, County Sheriff <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasser </PERSON> said. `` It's not like we're expecting an onslaught,'' <PERSON> Wasser </PERSON> said. The Aug. 15-17, 1969, concert is seen by many as marking the peak of a decade of social change in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The crowd gathered at the site since Saturday included some original festival-goers and others not even born then. The weather was the same as 20 years ago _ rainy _ as were conditions on the field now owned by <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON> _ muddy. While <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> is planning no official remembrance on <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'s 20th anniversary, the Imperial resort hotel in <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> is staging a `` Remember Woodstock'' concert Thursday to Saturday featuring such <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> alumni as <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>

<HEAD>Panamanian Bank Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering, Fined $5 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Panamanian bank was ordered to pay the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> a record $ 5 million fine after pleading guilty to federal charges that it laundered $ 411 million for a South American cocaine cartel. <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where two managers allegedly conspired with the <PERSON> Medillin </PERSON> cartel, entered its guilty plea Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Kelley </PERSON>. The $ 5 million fine was the largest ever imposed by a federal court against a bank for drug-money laundering, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The conviction was the first of its kind involving a foreign bank with no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations. The guilty plea resulted from a plea bargain between prosecutors and the bank, which had faced a maximum penalty of fines totaling $ 10.5 million and forfeiture of an amount equal to assets identified as cocaine proceeds. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which helped in the two-year investigation dubbed Operation Polar Cap, each will receive $ 1 million of the fine, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The fine-sharing arrangement was the first of its kind, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` This international cooperation in the war against drugs sends a message to drug traffickers everywhere that it is going to be harder for them to hide their ill-gotten profits, and easier for us to recover them,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` The bank pled guilty because of the activities of two people in one branch office,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, an attorney for the bank. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said drug-profit transfers slipped through the bank unnoticed because the bank `` exists to transfer funds. It's a trade bank.'' According to prosecutors, the general manager and a commercial manager at a <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> branch were bribed by members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. The Colombian ring reportedly accounts for up to 80 percent of the cocaine entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The bank is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The money was sent out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` laundered'' through wire transfers, transactions used routinely to exchange large sums of money. To conceal cocaine profits, the money launderers, posing as jewelry dealers, exchanged gold-painted lead bars among themselves to generate phony gold bullion transactions, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Wilmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said during Monday's hearing. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said informants and undercover <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as money launderers penetrated the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and met several times with its leaders. `` The significance of this case can not be overestimated,'' said <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. `` We have dealt a significant blow _ certainly not a death knell, but a significant blow to the ability of the cartel to meet its major problem in this country ... what to do with the vast amounts of cash.'' The bank pleaded guilty to one count of aiding cocaine trafficking through money laundering and to one count of conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Acting under the agreement, the bank on Monday paid by check the $ 2 million of the fine being split by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The bank agreed to pay the remaining $ 3 million over the next four years. <PERSON> O'Kelley </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> lists a net worth of only about $ 7 million. He said the fine represented a substantial share of the bank's capital `` The court has some question as to the ability of the bank to survive a penalty more severe,'' the judge said. The general manager, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarin </PERSON>, and the commercial manager, <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, remain under indictment. Part of the fine will be applied to a special federal fund allowing the money to be used for prison construction and anti-drug expenses. Under legislation enacted in 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can seize property owned or under the control of narcotics traffickers even when the actual profits are no longer available for seizure. `` Moving the assets of illegal drug trafficking out of one bank account and into another can no longer cover up the illegal act,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` It is like fingerprints that can not be brushed away.''

 <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s widow could take over her husband's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat almost without opposition, but some politicians are pondering a race for the post if she chooses not to run, observers say. `` So many people know her personally and out of respect for <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and her, she could walk in,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said of <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>. `` In the great Southern tradition, it's the wife who would come forward,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s wife is in there, you're not going to have anyone running against her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> is a 30-year-old investment banker with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>. Observers also noted that she is two months pregnant and has a 3-year-old son. `` I would think her first concern is her health and child,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. Members of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s family have remained in seclusion since the wreckage of his plane was found Sunday in a remote area of <LOCATION> Ethiopa </LOCATION>. `` She is a very strong young woman, but she has been badly shaken,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, a family friend. `` All in all, she has been extremely courageous and she has taken it extremely well.'' Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> has not made a decision on a special election date. It must be held on or before Nov. 7. If Mrs. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> chose to succeed her husband, she would not be the first.

Other potential aspirants include <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a friend who lost a 1978 runoff against <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Leland </LOCATION> friend who went to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to be close to the search. `` Everybody in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is reluctant to discuss this, out of respect for <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and his family,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` But the practical side is that of the people who have looked at the district before _ the two named most are <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> is out of his office this week and has not discussed running for the seat, said <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Belt </PERSON>, his office coordinator. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said it was inappropriate to comment on a possible race this soon.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened higher but fell slightly in Tuesday afternoon trading against the Japanese yen, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> firmed. The dollar opened at 142.40 yen, up 0.47 yen from Monday's close of 141.93 yen, and moved between 142.20 yen and 142.70 yen. It finished at 142.20 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which declined 41.34 points Monday, added 139.07 points, or 0.40 percent, to close at 34,810.69. `` There was no market-affecting news'' this morning, said a foreign exchange dealer at The Dai-ichi <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> had intervened during the morning session but with little effect. `` The dollar is robust,'' but should not rise over 144 yen, he said. The dealer predicted the market would not fluctuate much the rest of the week, which is a holiday for many market participants. The stock exchange firmed in the morning session, even though the volume of transactions was only 200 million shares, said a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` High-tech stocks and steels were the focus'' of this morning's trading, he said High-tech `` is very important to Japanese future growth. As for steels, they are very important for infrastructure expansion and should be bought in large amounts, but until now they were being sold cheaply,'' he said. He also said machine issues such as <ORGANIZATION> Yamatake-Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> firmed on a report in the economic newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> that said orders for machine tools had increased 30 percent the first six months of this year.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, finally cleared of a rape that his one-time accuser later said she invented, says he's bitter over the agony the legal system put him through. `` It's a good system but mistakes happen,'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> said Monday after a judge overturned his conviction. `` I have my bitterness, yes. It has been hard to deal with.'' After the judge acted, prosecutors dropped charges that could have led to a new trial, saying they could not win the case again. As the hearing ended, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> turned and smiled at his relatives in the audience, then heaved a sigh of relief. `` It's over,'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> told reporters. `` As they say, this is the first day of the rest of my life.'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was convicted in 1979 of the rape and aggravated kidnapping of <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> and was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> had served six years of the sentence when <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Harrisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, homemaker, said she invented the 1977 attack because she feared she had become pregnant by her boyfriend. `` I forgave her a long time ago. I've no animosity against her,'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> said. `` As far as I'm concerned, today my name has been cleared.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McLario </PERSON>, said she was pleased with the dismissal of charges and wondered `` why something like this was n't done long ago. `` She trusts that it will be put to rest and she naturally wishes the best for <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McLario </PERSON> said. `` She is very sorry for the part she had in this unfortunate situation. When she came forward in 1985 she never anticipated it would be a four-year odyssey.'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> a new trial based on genetic tests which prove his semen could not have made the stain in Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s underpants _ the key in his conviction. Prosecutor <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shines </PERSON> moved to dismiss the charges against him, citing conflicts in Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s statements and the difficulty in disputing the genetic test. Ms. <PERSON> Shines </PERSON> also said it was uncertain that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> would have to spend more time in jail if convicted again. Ms. <PERSON> Shines </PERSON> said the state `` absolutely -LRB- does -RRB- not'' owe <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> an apology. `` He was tried by a jury of his peers,'' she said. `` I do n't believe a mistake was made. But <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, said the only conclusion was that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was falsely convicted. `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s going to have to live with the horror of knowing that he was incarcerated all those years for a crime he never committed,'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, 32, who married and became a father since his release, was paroled last August after recurring minor problems with the law returned him to prison. He has two months left in an alcohol and drug treatment center, and said the program has changed his life. `` It's hard for us to take a look at ourselves,'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> said. `` I feel more confident in myself. For the first time in 12 years I can take responsibility for my own actions.'' He plans to attend college this fall, and train to be a drug and alcohol counselor, he said. When Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> recanted her testimony, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> clemency, saying his punishment had been sufficient. But the governor refused to pardon <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, saying he did not believe Ms. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s reversal. `` I wish him well,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said after Monday's hearing. `` I hope he will be able to conquer his alcohol dependency and live a normal and productive life.''

 Engineers will get their first look at the damaged hull of the Exxon Valdez after the crippled tanker goes into drydock for a nine-month repair job.

The 166-foot wide Valdez, which spilled about 11 million gallons of crude in Alaskan waters when it hit a reef March 24 in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, must squeeze inside a dock with just three feet of clearance. `` It's the first time <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION> has done this,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they plan to return the 987-foot-long tanker to service, possibly under a different name, after repairs are completed. Nearly one-third of the ship's bottom either is gone or has been severely weakened, and 24 brackets had to be welded to the hull so the tanker would n't collapse under its own weight in drydock. After being towed 2,000 miles from <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> waited offshore for three weeks after officials detected oil slicks around it. Before the ship could navigate the 42-foot-deep channel of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, divers removed massive steel slabs that dangled from the hull as far as 70 feet below the surface. The ship finally arrived at <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION> on July 31. Though booms have remained in place since then to contain possible spills, <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION> officials say no discharges or slicks have appeared.

<HEAD>Trial Judge Rules Judges Retain Fishing Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Abenaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> said a judge's decision to grant the group fishing rights is one step toward winning back land claimed by the tribe. `` This victory is for fishing rights,'' said tribal chief <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. `` Now we'll be fighting for our land.'' The ruling by Vermont District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolchik </PERSON> recognized the <ORGANIZATION> Abenaki </ORGANIZATION>'s aboriginal fishing rights dating back 11,000 years. It dismissed fish and game violations filed two years ago by the state against several tribe members. The state contended the tribespeople had no right to fish without the state license required of other people. The Abenakis number about 2,500 and live primarily in northwestern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wolchik </PERSON> said the state failed to prove the tribe `` abandoned or ceded their <LOCATION> Missisquoi </LOCATION> homeland or that their aborginal rights were extinguished by either an express act or an act clearly and unambiguously implying any sovereign's intent to extinguish those rights. `` Accordingly, the <LOCATION> Missisquoi </LOCATION>'s aborginal right to fish in their <LOCATION> Missisquoi </LOCATION> homeland continues to exist today,'' he wrote. Although the ruling dealt only with the issue of fishing rights, <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rona </PERSON>, the tribe's lawyer said `` what makes this so monumental for the Abenakis is that the issues the court needed to address and did address in this fishing case are precisely the same as would be addressed in a land claim.'' But it was not clear whether the special status that <PERSON> Wolchik </PERSON> granted the tribe would translate into anything more than the right to fish. The judge found the Abenakis do not meet the federal definition of a dependent Indian community, a finding that could impact any future land claims. `` The available evidence leads this court to conclude that neither the Missisquoi homeland or any part of it is Indian country,'' the judge said. `` The thrust of the evidence is that the Missiquoi community is thoroughly mixed if not blended into the non-native American community.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Eschen </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general, said that while the Abenakis had contested the state's criminal jurisdiction over the tribe, <PERSON> Wolchik </PERSON> found the state does have jurisdiction. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said he would push, through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, for total autonomy for the tribe. The Abenakis trace their tribe back to 9300 B.C. In recent decades they have begun pushing to assert their right over land in northern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. The fight has split the tribe itself, with one faction favoring more militant stands such as tribal courts, schools and law enforcement. That faction, led by <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, is in power today. The case originated in 1987, when Abenakis held a fish-in on the banks of the <LOCATION> Missisquoi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Swanton </LOCATION>. More than 30 people were charged with fishing without a license or failure to display a license.

<TEXT>
 Authorities took into custody today a South Korean student and a New York-educated Korean priest who crossed the border from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to dramatize national unification efforts. Twenty-year-old Im Su-kyong, nicknamed `` The Flower of Unification,'' held the hand of the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyu-hyon </PERSON> as they crossed the border at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, officials said. Ms. Im and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> were taken into immediate custody and flown to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by police helicopter, where she was reportedly sneaked into <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for a check-up and is expected later today to be turned over to the national intelligence agency. The hospital would not confirm the report, but it was ringed by riot police who blocked the entrance of reporters. The priest was under arrest, officials said. Government officials said Ms. <PERSON> Im </PERSON> and the priest would be charged with violating national security laws for making illegal trips to an enemy country. The two were detained by South Korean officers assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> as soon as they walked across the border at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, the truce village in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a signatory to the 1953 Korean Armistice that ended their bloody war, has jurisdiction over the southern half of the truce village. Speaking to a rally of about 70 people in the northern sector of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Im </PERSON> said her return across the border was intended to promote the re-unification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, divided since 1945, the officials said. `` I hope my act will contribute to advance the unification of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' she was quoted as saying. `` <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one forever and we must work to unify our fatherland.'' North Korean news reports received in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> radical student was cheered by tens of thousands of people today when she left the border town of <LOCATION> Kaesong </LOCATION> for the truce village. `` Taking into consideration the firm determination of Ms. Im to return to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with ardent desire for unification, our side decided to open the door of our area at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> and will thoroughly guarantee their safety,'' the North Korean reports said. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 1,000 people, including about a dozen foreigners, marched in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> shouting `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> who block unification'' and `` Safe passage for Miss Im _ the unification flower!'' South Korean officials said about 3,000 riot police were deployed along the road leading to <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to block a possible attempt by radical students and dissidents to march to the border. In a speech marking <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s liberation from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo asked that the communist <PERSON> North </PERSON> immediately resume all channels of suspended dialogue. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> must realize that the only thing they can gain by agitating the extremists and radicals within our society and by enticing a few of them to secretly visit <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> is the abhorrence of our people,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. Dialogue between the two Koreas has been sporadic but meetings have been held the last year in an effort to improve relations. The talks, however, bogged down after secret trips to the North by a South Korean dissident clergyman, a lawmaker and the student, Ms. Im.

 A man found guilty of murder, counterfeiting, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s largest bank heist had been convicted only once before this summer, but the courts decided he was no stranger to crime. Judges on Monday bypassed a federal act under which <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> could have been eligible for leniency and gave him the stiffest sentence in the memory of prosecutors in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> to life in prison plus 43 years on robbery, murder, jail escape and murder-for-hire charges. `` Mr. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> is certainly one of the most, if not the most, dangerous criminal in the district,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. `` There are other people who have had the potential, but he's the one who had it all come up in the same summer. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, 43, was convicted in June of staging <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s largest bank robbery and with killing a federal witness In July, he and his girlfriend were found guilty in a counterfeiting plot that made $ 800,000 in bad bills. This month, he and three others were convicted in a jail-escape and murder-for-hire scheme. `` He told preposterous stories to three separate juries. He's a pathological liar,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. `` There's no act that this man would n't do. This man should set no foot in public for the rest of his life.'' Federal Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Staker </PERSON>, who handled the counterfeiting trial, imposed a nine-year sentence to run concurrent with <PERSON> Haden </PERSON>'s penalty <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>'s Branch, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was fined a total of $ 262,500. The <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> case challenged the limits of the Sentencing Guidelines Act of 1987, established to help trim jail populations and grant leniency to newcomers to the world of crime. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, with only a 1982 mail fraud conviction behind him, began the summer eligible for leniency under the guidelines. The sentence imposed by <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> is the stiffest in memory in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. The district does n't have complete records on sentencings. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> maintained his innocence and claimed <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> had a vendetta against him because he used legal knowledge gained in prison to help others. In addition to robbing the <ORGANIZATION> Matewan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch at <LOCATION> Kermit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was convicted of intimidating federal witnesses and of killing <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, an accomplice in the robbery, in 1987.

 `` Parenthood'' pleasures and the deep-water perils of `` The Abyss'' were box-office favorites this weekend, heading a list that included loony comedies and die-hard blockbusters. Universal's `` Parenthood,'' starring <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, took in $ 9.7 million in its second week of release, according to figures released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The Abyss,'' with the lesser-known <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastrantonio </PERSON>, scored a hit with its hardware-heavy tale of close encounters in the deep ocean. The big-budget film earned $ 9.3 million in its debut week. But the 2 hour and 20 minute running time cost the movie one showing per day in many theaters, contributing to an unimpressive per-screen average of $ 6,079. The return of sarcastic slasher <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> brought `` A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child'' to third place in its first weekend of release. `` Nightmare'' grossed $ 8.1 million, followed by the <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks-drooling </PERSON> dog police comedy `` Turner and Hooch'' in fourth with $ 6.3 million. The romantic comedy `` When <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Met </PERSON> <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> ...,'' with <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> as best friends who become lovers, finished in fifth with ticket sales of $ 6.2 million. `` Lethal Weapon 2,'' the police adventure sequel with <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, was next with $ 6.1 million. Still going strong in seventh place was `` Batman,'' collecting $ 5 million. `` Batman'' has now sold $ 223 million worth of tickets. It was trailed by the fading <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> prison movie `` Lock Up,'' in eighth with $ 3.34 million. Rounding out the Top 10 were the family comedy `` Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' with $ 3.33 million in ninth and the withering `` Young <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'' with $ 2.1 million. Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release. 1. `` Parenthood,'' Universal, $ 9.7 million, 1,300 screens, $ 7,440 per screen, $ 30.3 million, two weeks. 2. `` The Abyss,'' 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, $ 9.3 million, 1,533 screens, $ 6,079 per screen, $ 13 million, one week. 3. `` A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,'' New Line, $ 8.1 million, 1,902 screens, $ 4,266 per screen, $ 8.1 million, one week. 4. `` Turner and <PERSON> Hooch </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 6.3 million, 1,880 screens, $ 3,357 per screen, $ 38.9 million, three weeks. 5. `` When <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Met </PERSON> <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> ...,'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, $ 6.2 million, 1,171 screens, $ 5,292 per screen, $ 45.9 million, five weeks. 6. `` Lethal Weapon 2,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 6.1 million, 1,830 screens, $ 3,318 per screen, $ 112.1 million, six weeks. 7. `` Batman,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5 million, 1,770 screens, $ 2,840 per screen, $ 223 million, eight weeks. 8. `` Lock Up,'' Tri-Star, $ 3.34 million, 1,384 screens, $ 2,415 per screen, $ 12 million, two weeks. 9. `` Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3.33 million, 1,451 screens, $ 2,293 per screen, $ 108.2 million, seven weeks. 10. `` Young <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.1 million, 1,217 screens, $ 1,686 per screen, $ 7.1 million, two weeks.

<HEAD>Pravda Blasts Baltics for `Nationalist Hysteria'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda today blasted extremists and growing `` nationalist hysteria'' in the Baltic region for labor unrest that is now its seventh day in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. `` Openly anti-Soviet groups have become activized'' in the three Baltic republics and `` a situation is building up of nationalist hysteria,'' the newspaper said in an unsigned commentary. In two other Soviet areas threatened by labor unrest, the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, officials said today that all was quiet. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief called Monday for <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> workers in his tiny republic to end the strike and negotiate differences. But in the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, strike committee member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> said today that thousands of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> workers at about 50 factories stayed off the job to protest a new law that tightens residency requirements for voters and candidates. Pravda aimed its criticism at the law rather than the strikers, saying `` the passage of discriminatory acts has an extremely destabilizing influence on the political situation.'' Pravda's comments reflected <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s unease with the grassroots nationalist movements that have swept the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. The movements, known as People's Fronts, have moved from focusing on support for President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms to `` narrow nationalist positions,'' Pravda said. It complained that the fronts had taken to attacking the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for neglecting the interests of non-Russian populations, and that `` certain forces'' were pushing for complete secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Pravda also criticized the Baltic movements for sending emissaries around the country to spread their ideas, and `` using foreign ties more and more often for the same destructive goals.'' It proposed political dialogue as the only means of defusing the situation. Estonian party chief <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> said Monday that dialogue had not succeeded in resolving the strike, but that he was not ready to give up. `` We met with strike committee representatives and they later said they were not satisfied with the results. If so, let's continue the talks,'' <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> said in an Estonian television interview. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the Estonian law will take the right to vote away from more than 100,000 non-Estonians in the republic of 1.6 million people. The new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the same district for two years, or anywhere in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for five years. Candidates must live in the same place for five years, or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> admitted the rights of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s minorities _ whom he did not identify but presumably including Russians _ had not been taken into account. `` This is our mistake and it must be corrected,'' he said. Estonians say residence requirements for voters and candidates are legitimate measures used around the world. But one strike leader said if Americans had a similar law, they would have to wait five years to be able to vote after moving from one state to another. The strike has already cost millions of dollars, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. The striking Russians, most of whom work in heavy industrial plants, also object to a new national decision to give <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> free rein over its economy. The workers are demanding that factories with a predominantly Russian-speaking labor force remain the property of the national government rather than be handed over to <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> petty officer has filed suit to collect the $ 100,000 life insurance benefit of a shipmate who died as a result of the April 19 gun-turret blast aboard the USS Iowa. The lawsuit filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> seeks payment of a $ 50,000 double-indemnity policy to <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Amex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, now stationed at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, is the sole beneficiary of the policy held by his fellow gunners mate, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, one of 47 sailors killed in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion. The life insurance company has refused to pay the claim on <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s death until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> completes its investigation into the accident, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` They are waiting for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report and they said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is indicating they have circumstantial evidence that it might have been a suicide,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. Amex, a division of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, would not comment on the lawsuit. Amex had two months to pay the benefit from the filing of the loss, which occurred June 12, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` I think they will settle with us as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report does not reach the conclusion there was a suicide, and it wo n't,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` We are very upset that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report is taking so long to come out. Either the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is planning a whitewash or a coverup, I do n't know which of the two. That's why it is taking so long,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. News reports after the explosion indicated that investigators, suspicious of the life insurance policy, at one point were focusing on <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said in June that <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents had apologized to his client for news leaks suggesting that <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was involved in the explosion. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had determined that the explosion aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was the result of sabotage by a suicidal sailor. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation reached that decision after ruling out mechanical malfunctions, accidental detonation, electrical flaws and all other technical causes for the explosion. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said July 19 that the conclusion of suicide `` was not based on official reports of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Constitutional scholars urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject a proposed amendment outlawing desecration of the American flag, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator said there was political pressure to agree to the measure. The 200-year-old former home of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was the setting Monday for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s second hearing on what action, if any, should be taken in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s June decision that flag burning represents protected political speech The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and leading Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> support a constitutional amendment that would permit states to outlaw destruction of the flag. But a Philadelphia-based federal judge and two constitutional historians asked the committee Monday to show restraint. Flag burning, while carrying powerful emotional weight, is not a serious enough offense to merit the curtailment of free-speech protections, said federal Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON>, the former dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> law school. `` I urge you not to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, not to celebrate that anniversary by submitting a proposed amendment which would dilute protections of the First Amendment,'' <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON> said. The session was considered an official judiciary panel hearing, even though Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., and Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., were the only members The hearing was held at the 200-year-old former city hall, which housed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from 1791 until 1800. Fifty-three senators have agreed to sponsor a constitutional amendment, <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said, noting that `` there is a considerable political downside'' to not going along, since so many Americans were outraged by the high court ruling. `` I confess to being one of those who was indignant -LRB- at the court decision -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said. Still, <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said he would prefer that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> simply pass a bill outlawing flag desecration; <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> agreed Proponents of the amendment argue that such a sweeping statement is needed because a bill might not pass constitutional muster with the high court. An amendment would require a two-thirds majority vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and ratification by three-quarters of the states. `` I would like to see the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> take the third option of doing nothing,'' <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON> said. `` Doing nothing may be the hardest of the options,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> replied: `` I disagree with you, Judge <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON>, that doing nothing may be the hardest thing to do. We are experts at that.'' Law professor <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> and history professor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to overreact. <PERSON> Kutler </PERSON> compared the flag issue to prohibition, which came about with the 18th Amendment and was later repealed. In both cases, he said, `` emotion ruled.''

 An incoming call to a mobile phone in luggage aboard a commuter plane apparently triggered a smoke alarm, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing, a federal official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> I plane carrying seven passengers and two crew members landed without incident Monday and no one was injured, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> supervisor at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

The pilot of the twin-engine, turbo-prop plane radioed the airport about 5:30 p.m. and emergency vehicles were called out to the runway, he said. After the plane landed, the crew discovered a cellular telephone in a passenger's suitcase, and determined a call had caused the problem, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has stirred both hope and doubt about his ability to lead <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> toward a peaceful solution of its racial conflicts. The 53-year-old education minister, who was sworn in today in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> as acting president, is known as an affable pragmatist who seeks to avoid ideological labels. He became leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in February, narrowly defeating a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleague in a parliamentary party caucus. `` Our goal is a new <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a totally changed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> at the time. `` White domination, insofar as it still exists, must go.'' Later, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said: `` White security can never be built on injustice toward others. Things will have to change drastically and quickly.'' After several years of black protests and increasing world sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s rule, many whites saw de Klerk as representing a new and more conciliatory generation of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. They welcomed the vision of a nation in which, as he put it, `` all reasonable people align themselves behind mutually acceptable goals.'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, who pioneered anti-apartheid views among <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members, said of de Klerk: `` People are being too optimistic if they think he is going to throw fundamental policy overboard, but I think he's pragmatic and intelligent. He realizes that change is absolutely inevitable.'' Black leaders said they suspect <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will pursue largely cosmetic changes. Their suspicions were strengthened by his refusal to accept a one-man, one-vote system that would give power to the black majority, and by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s platform for general elections Sept. 6. The platform supports the idea of group social and political rights, which has helped preserve segregated neighborhoods and schools under the apartheid system of racial separation. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> practiced law before entering <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. He held several Cabinet posts beginning in 1978 and in 1982 took the powerful job of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in the <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most populous and wealthiest province. He is married, with three children and his wife, <PERSON> Marike </PERSON>, once described him as `` a charmer, with many broken hearts left after him.'' <PERSON> F.W. </PERSON>, as he likes to be called, comes from a long line of politicians beginning with his great-grandfather, a senator. His brother <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> quit as editor of Rapport, the largest Afrikaans-language newspaper, after being criticized for increasingly liberal views on race reform. The brothers have differed over politics, but have said they never let those differences affect their close family relationship. South African analysts picture <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> as a centrist, careful not to alienate either conservatives or liberals in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. If, as expected, the party wins the Sept. 6 elections, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will become president with the same task as <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>: To meet black demands for civil rights and still reassure the minority whites their way of life will not be destroyed. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> of the banned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, said recently de Klerk and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` are pieces of the same carcass. If the meat is bad, the meat is bad.''

<TEXT>
 A Marine has filed a $ 55 million suit against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> charging that malpractice forced his wife to have a blood transfusion that left her infected with AIDS, which she passed on to him and their son. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, 40, a chief warrant officer at the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, contends that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> doctors mishandled his wife's pregnancy in 1981, resulting in a stillbirth and the need for a transfusion At the time, little was known about AIDS, and donated blood was not routinely screened for the virus. But <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>'s suit, which is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 21 in federal court, says the transfusion would not have been needed had doctors properly treated his wife, <PERSON> Mutsuko </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> died of AIDS in 1987, shortly after the lawsuit was filed. The Gaffneys' son, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>, was born with AIDS and died in 1986 at the age of 13 months. The only member of the family to be spared infection was their 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Maureene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> himself has tested positive for the virus, although he has not yet shown any symptoms. <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who is representing the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on the case. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenney </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators traced one of the units of blood that <PERSON> Mutsuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> received to a discharged Marine. A deposition from the blood donor, identified as `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' in court records, shows he has refused to be tested for AIDS because he fears the result might prevent him from getting jobs and health insurance. Mrs. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> was under the care of doctors at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when she delivered the stillborn baby four weeks overdue. The doctors had declined to induce labor earlier or to perform a caesarian section to deliver the baby, the lawsuit says.

 Israeli warplanes buzzed Palestinian refugee camps near this southern port today, drawing heavy anti-aircraft fire from guerrillas, police reported. The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> earlier reported the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fighter-bombers hit targets near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, who can not be named under standing regulations, said the Israeli jets `` did not attack.'' The spokesman said two Israeli jet fighters flew at `` a very low altitude'' over the <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh camps on the city's eastern edge at 12:15 p.m. -LRB- 4:15 a.m. EDT -RRB- Guerrillas in the sprawling shantytowns opened up on the jets with twin-barrelled anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed when the jets made a single pass over the camps. Witnesses in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> action triggered panic in the city. Several motorists jumped from their vehicles and took cover in bomb shelters, entrances to buildings and fields. The Israeli air force has carried out nine raids this year against targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s refugee camps. Eight people have been killed and 67 wounded in the air strikes.

<TEXT>
 Environmental activists from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> took to the treetops to voice their opposition to logging in the country's remaining virgin timberlands. Protesters set up camps in trees to coincide with the first of four hearings by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on its proposal to list the northern spotted owl as a threatened species. Environmentalists say the owl requires old-growth forests for its habitat; the forest-products industry says many logging and mill jobs would be lost if the owl is protected by setting aside forest in protected zones. `` This is obviously spotted owl week throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherney </PERSON>, an Earth First! spokesman involved in the protests near <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The timber crisis is culminating to such an extent right now, that now's the time'' for action. Earth First!, known for putting spikes in trees to discourage logging, said its `` aerial occupations'' had protesters sitting on 3-by-6-foot platforms suspended in trees. They were equipped with food, water and other gear, and supported by ground crews, <PERSON> Cherney </PERSON> said. The protests began Sunday or Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cherney </PERSON> said. Others were planned in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Some protesters said they were prepared to stay in the trees for weeks. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 31, lodged himself 50 feet high in an evergreen outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. He said he had enough food and water to last at least four days. <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> was the site Monday of the first hearing, at which a top official in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the spotted owl can survive without being listed as a threatened species under federal wildlife protection law. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Salwasser </PERSON>, deputy director for wildlife and fisheries, said his agency is managing timberlands with the aim of ensuring the owl's long-term survival. Although the hearings were supposed to center on the biological concerns of the owl, many loggers testified about the economic consequences they feared if logging is restricted. Federal judges already have halted timber sales in the region because of lawsuits filed by environmentalists. `` To tell you the truth, I'm scared to death,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> as he held his 3-year-old son, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, in his arms. Hall, a superintendent for High Cascade Lumber in <LOCATION> Skamania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said his mill is expected to run out of logs _ and jobs _ in November. <PERSON> Cherney </PERSON> said the demonstrations were not just about the spotted owl, but included concerns over forest resources in general. `` If someone's sitting in a second-growth tree our message is: Let some of these second-growth forests become old-growth forests,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baker-Snoqualmie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, three demonstrators climbed trees in the Goodman Ridge timber sale in an attempt to stop logging, said <PERSON> Janine </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaeloch </PERSON>, an Earth First! spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said he knew of no agency policy for dealing with such protests and that decisions were made at the scene. `` We do n't want to violate anyone's constitutional rights to free expression, but we also want to guarantee ... that logging operations are able to continue,'' he said.

 National Party leader F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was sworn in today as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s acting president, a day after he and other Cabinet members forced the resignation of P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. In a news conference immediately after taking the oath of office, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> praised the ousted <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who was in power for 11 tumultuous years, as one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s greatest leaders. `` His greatest gift to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the fact that he has put our country on the road to fundamental reform, that he has successfully started pulling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> out of its dead-end streets and that he guided us in the direction of a totally new dispensation,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. Shortly after being sworn in at the Union Buildings by Chief Justice <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said he planned to convene a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 13, a week after national elections. He is expected to be chosen by an electoral congress the next day to serve a full five-year term as president. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had attacked de Klerk personally in what was seen as a bitter and undignified farewell speech broadcast on national television Monday night. Specifically, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he opposed de Klerk's plans to make an important diplomatic trip to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> later this month. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> defended himself in a television interview immediately following <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s speech, and said the 73-year-old president's departure `` was in the best interest of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, with his party's support, initiated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s first halting steps of race reform in the late 1970's and early 1980's, though his efforts slowed considerably after nationwide black unrest erupted in 1984. After his swearing-in, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, `` His place in history among the great leaders that our country produced is already assured.'' `` There is no doubt that we stand on the threshold of a new era in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the 53-year-old <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. `` History offers us a unique opportunity for peaceful solutions.'' `` I trust that the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will show the courage and vision required to break the cycle of conflict, tension and isolation that has gripped us for so long,'' he said. `` We want to build a new <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in which all people participate in decisions affecting their lieves at all levels.'' Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a leading critic of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said of de Klerk: `` All he is doing is giving a new face to apartheid.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said the transition is `` just a change of initials from P.W. to F.W.'' But <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> office that he felt sorry for <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. `` He looked a pathetic figure. Here we saw a coup. They did n't use guns, but they certainly put pistols to his head. In general, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and the other Cabinet ministers were more sympathetic to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> than the public and news media today. The banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition, said the leadership change will make little difference to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks. The Cabinet members told <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who suffered a stroke Jan. 18, to use his health as an excuse for resigning 23 days before the crucial polls. But the defiant <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said his health was not the issue. `` I am not prepared to leave on a lie,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he told the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> showed no emotion or signs of ill health when reading his 20-minute resignation statement from a desk at his official residence in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` After all these years of my best efforts for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and for the government of this country as well as the security of our country, I am being ignored by ministers serving in my Cabinet,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, nicknamed the `` Great Crocodile'' for his feared temper and sometimes ruthless manner, seldom appeared in public following his stroke. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> insisted he was not a `` sulky old man,'' but he never offered congratulations to <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as party leader in February. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s behavior became increasingly erratic in recent weeks. Last month he refused to attend a farewell banquet planned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to honor him. He did, however, appear unannounced at a provincial party congress, forcing <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to give up his seat at the head table. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, a lawyer who appears to share <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s vision of limited and gradual race reform, has spoken in vague terms of dismantling more apartheid laws. However, he has not promised any specific changes on major apartheid issues such as power-sharing with the black majority or desegregating schools and neighborhoods. `` <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was party to the disastrous policies of the government under P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s rule,'' the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The mass democratic movement demands the government as a whole resigns so that democracy and peace may be established once and for all.'' P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who met with four black African leaders last year, worked hard to increase South African contact with the rest of the continent. But he had said it was `` inopportune to meet with President <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> at this stage,'' because the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement is based in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and is planning to disrupt the September elections. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 41 years, is expected to lose ground to both the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on its left and the hard-line segregationist <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on its right.

<HEAD>Murders of Young Girls Terrify Tokyo Suburbs</HEAD>

 A man arrested in connection with the kidnapping and slaying of a 5-year-old girl has confessed to killing two other girls in a series of cases that have brought fear to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> suburbs, police said today. In a society remarkably free of crime, the brutality of the murders in an area northwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has shocked many Japanese and dominated news and television reports. The cases, however, also have drawn attention to the many animated films available in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that show violence and scenes of undressed girls and comic books involving crime. The suspect, <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, said he collected them. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, the 26-year-old son of a printing shop owner, was arrested Friday in the kidnapping and killing of 5-year-old <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomoto </PERSON> two months ago. On Sunday, police said he confessed to killing two 4-year-old girls, <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Konno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Namba </PERSON>. Police said they also were questioning <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> about whether he was involved in the disappearance of a fourth girl, 7-year-old <PERSON> Masami </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshizawa </PERSON>, missing since October. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> was first arrested July 23 for allegedly forcing a 6-year-old girl to let him take nude pictures of her. During questioning, he admitted to having killed <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> and directed police to a wooded area where her skull was found, police said. Police said <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> told them he had picked up <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> in his car but became angry when she `` made fun of a deformity'' in his hands and strangled her. He then took her body to his room, where he chopped off her head, hands and feet, they said. Her torso was found northwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on June 11. `` I can not control myself when I see a young girl,'' newspapers quoted him as telling police. Since <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> confessed last week to murdering <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON>, an army of reporters has been stationed at his house, police headquarters, the victims' houses and murder sites. When questioned, teachers told reporters <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> seldom stood out and left little impression on them. Acquaintances described <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> as a quiet loner who bragged about his collection of nearly 4,500 videotapes, including many animated films. One of <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>'s videotapes, `` Chiniku no Hana'' -LRB- Flower of Blood and Flesh -RRB-, has a plot that resembles <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON>'s murder, investigators said. In it, a man follows a girl in his car, kidnaps her and then dismembers her in his apartment. Police quoted <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> as saying he picked up <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> in his car and `` drove her to a mountain, where I strangled her to death. I took two pictures of her in the car. I burned her with other things in the front yard at my house. I put her bones and ashes in a box and put it at the front door of <PERSON> Mari </PERSON>'s home.'' In February, when the box was found, letters were sent to <PERSON> Mari </PERSON>'s family and to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> signed with the female name `` <PERSON> Yuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Imada </PERSON>. In the letters, the writer claimed to have killed <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> out of frustration from being unable to bear a child. Investigators said Monday they had discovered that `` <PERSON> Yuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Imada </PERSON>'' was the name of a female detective in a 1988 comic book who solved a case involving a poisoned salami in a supermarket. Police said they believe <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> wrote the letters because of his interest in comics and animated films. Police said <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> told them he had kidnapped <PERSON> Erika </PERSON>, strangled her in his car, stripped off her clothes and left her in a forest. <PERSON> Mitsuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maniwa </PERSON>, a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Shizuoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> was unable to distinguish between reality and fiction because of his overwhelming interest in horror and animation videos. `` Through images and advertising, comic books, magazines and videotapes, men are taught to look at women as objects,'' said <PERSON> Chie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanematsu </PERSON>, editor of a newsletter published by <ORGANIZATION> Kodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Onnatachi </ORGANIZATION>, a group fighting exploitative images of women. `` This is the environment Japanese children grow up in.'' Under Japanese law, prosecutors have up to 20 days to release him or bring charges.

 A suspect was charged with murder and kidnapping for allegedly beating a man in his home, abducting his wife and two small children and leaving the children near the women's body in a wooded area, police said. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynes </PERSON>, 21, was charged after turning himself in to police in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>. He was flown to <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> late Monday and was being held in the <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> awaiting <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> arraignment today or Wednesday, state police spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Authorities said family members identified the dead woman as Peg Shaw, 35. The state medical examiner's office scheduled an autopsy for Monday night, but the findings were not immediately available, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> identified her husband as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who is employed at the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The couple's children _ son, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, 3, and daughter, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, 1 _ were reunited with their father, police said. Police declined to say if <PERSON> Raynes </PERSON> knew the family or if any motive for the crime had been established. Before he turned himself in, police had put out an all-points bulletin for <PERSON> Raynes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> refused to say whether there was any evidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>'s home in the <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> linking <PERSON> Raynes </PERSON> to the assault. <PERSON> Raynes </PERSON> has longstanding family ties in <LOCATION> Gardiner </LOCATION>, where he was living with his parents, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. He was employed by an electrical contractor in the <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> area, he said. At about 6:30 a.m. Monday, an assailant entered the <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>'s home, striking <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> in the head with a wooden mallet and handcuffing him in the basement, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. About an hour later, neighbors heard <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> screaming for help, he said. Police were called and as they were questioning <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, the family's van drove past the house, he said. `` We feel at that point that the suspect was alone,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Police soon found the van abandoned at some railroad tracks in <LOCATION> Gardiner </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Early in the afternoon, a state police trooper noticed some tracks coming from a muddy road in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardiner </LOCATION>. Nearby, the trooper found the woman's body and her two children huddled together nearby. During the day, police used an airplane and boats on the <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in their search for the suspect, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Authorities also had set up roadblocks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 201 in the area, <ORGANIZATION> Gardiner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said.

<BYLINE>Bitterness May Be Natural Poison Alarm, Taste Expert Says ^By MALCOLM
RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ability to taste bitterness may be a natural defense against poisoning, says a prominent taste researcher. For one thing, bitterness and toxicity tend to appear together strikingly often, although there are exceptions, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartoshuk </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. For another, scientists have found that the tongue contains more than one kind of sensor to detect bitterness, she said. That would make sense if the system were set up to detect multiple types of poisons, she said. <PERSON> Bartoshuk </PERSON> discussed research in taste Monday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Bitterness and sweetness are detected when substances bind to specialized proteins, while saltiness and sourness are sensed in a different way, she said. She demonstrated the multiple types of bitterness detectors by having audience members taste postage-stamp-sized squares of paper impregnated with a substance called 6-n-propylthiouracil. About half the audience tasted it as bitter. The other half sensed no taste at all. Yet everybody in the audience could have tasted the bitterness of quinine, <PERSON> Bartoshuk </PERSON> said. So the two kinds of bitterness are picked up by different sensing proteins, she said. The ability to taste the chemical on the paper is determined genetically, she said. About two-thirds of the general population are `` tasters'' on this test, she said. Tasters find Swiss cheese more bitter than non-tasters do, she said. They also perceive sugar placed on the front of the tongue to be twice as sweet as non-tasters do, she said. Non-tasters find caffeine less bitter, and so are not likely to notice the difference between regular and decaffeinated coffee, she said. Just what difference the responsible genes make in the taste buds is not clear, but perhaps tasters have some bitterness-sensing proteins that non-tasters lack, she said.

 Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a hard-line stance against crime gained in 22 years of law enforcement, and in his short <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tenure he impressed colleagues with his knowledge of the law. The bodies of the freshman Republican congressman and his pilot were found Monday in the wreckage of a single-engine plane that crashed Sunday night in a densely-wooded area of the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The gray-haired ex-sheriff won a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> because of his law enforcement experience, despite a Republican tradition of appointing only lawyers to the panel. `` Because of his background and hard-working manner he gave every indication of becoming a star,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff, saying <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` had dedicated his life to public service.'' A date has not been set for a special election to fill his seat. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed regret in a statement read by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` Congressman <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was just beginning a promising career in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' it said. Searchers had to bulldoze their way to the thickly wooded crash site after rescuers spotted the wreckage of the single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 177 from the air. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 45, and his pilot, 58-year-old <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Vierling </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, had left <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION> Sunday evening for a 90-mile flight to <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had thrown out the first baseball at the Dixie Youth World Series. The plane's engine appeared to have been dead when it crashed, said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, deputy medical examiner for neighboring <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said there was no sign of fire or smell of gasoline at the crash site. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was the second congressman in as many weeks to die in a plane crash. Earlier Sunday, the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and 15 other people had been found in <LOCATION> Ethiopa </LOCATION> with no survivors. The plane disappeared Aug. 7 on a flight to a remote village. `` He had emerged as one of the real leaders in the freshman class of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. G.V. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., who had joined <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at the youth baseball series `` Our last conversation at the series was talking about the loss of Congressman <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, and I told <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> that he should be careful in traveling and performing his duties.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had co-sponsored legislation to strengthen federal drug law enforcement, and criticized drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> for backing an import ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. He once took fellow <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> shooting range to demonstrate his belief that shotguns were just as dangerous as assault weapons. He claimed 90 percent of crimes were committed with pistols and shotguns. A death penalty advocate, he supported making capital punishment laws uniform across the country. `` It may not deter crime, but that person who committed that heinous crime wo n't be out there,'' he said. He also advocated eliminating paroles and early release for dangerous criminals, and streamlining the federal appeals process, which he called `` never-ending.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> sat on the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> that drafted the final savings and loan bailout legislation, a rare assignment for a freshman. A native of the small south <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Poplarville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s law enforcement career began in 1966 when he joined the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department. In 1977, he was appointed chief of police in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>. Running as a reform candidate in 1983, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> defeated incumbent <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> to take over the scandal-ridden <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> later was convicted of racketeering and drug charges. Last November, he narrowly defeated state Sen. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> for the seat held by fellow Republican <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, who ran successfully for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Survivors include his wife, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON>, a daughter, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, and grandson. A memorial will be held Wednesday and Thursday in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>. A funeral Mass will be held Thursday, followed by the burial in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>.

 Soldiers drove public buses to get workers to offices today at the start of a daylong strike called by Sinhalese radicals protesting the continuing deployment of Indian troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Shops in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> were closed and hundreds of employees began returning home because most offices and businesses were not functioning. Soliders in camouflage uniforms patrolled the city and policemen were posted at major intersections and near bus stops. At least seven people were killed by Sinhalese radicals today and Monday, according to military officials. The officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the victims included two soldiers ambushed early today in the central town of <LOCATION> Nuwara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eliya </LOCATION>. The other killings were in the Sinhalese-dominated south, they said. The strike coincides with the 42nd anniversary of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> At least two Colombo-based newspapers refused to carry special supplements to mark the occasion, sources in the dailies said on condition of anonymity. The call for the strike came in posters signed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which the government describes as a radical group. The posters in the Sinhalese language denounced the presence of an estimated 43,000 Indian soldiers, deployed in the northeast to oversee a 1987 peace accord aimed at ending a Tamil insurrection for an independent nation. The ultra-nationalist front says the Indian troops compromise the country's sovereignty. It also says the government has made too many concessions to the Tamil militants, who began their separatist campaign in 1983. The Tamils argue they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population. Tamils are 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> on June 1 asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to withdraw its soldiers, but so far <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has pulled out only 2,200 troops and the results have failed to appease the extremists. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said a quick withdrawal of troops could lead to more violence but that it will withdraw soldiers in phases, pulling them all out by February. Sinhalese extremists have killed at least 4,000 people over the past two years, according to the government. About 11,000 other people have died in the 6-year-old Tamil revolt.

 Authorities have executed a policewoman in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> for taking tens of thousands of dollars in bribes, official reports said today. Major state newspapers and television reports said the policewoman, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayun </PERSON>, took bribes worth $ 56,150 in exchange for allowing people to remain in the southern city illegally. She was sentenced to death on June 19, but the reports did not say exactly when she was executed. Death sentences in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are usually carried out within a day or two with a bullet to the back of the head. In another report, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said authorities had received 172,000 tips from informants at corruption reporting centers from January to June. The centers are part of a major government anti-corruption drive. The reports mentioned three pending cases of officials also accused of taking bribes. About 22,000 officials were accused of wrongdoing by the informants.

 The brother-in-law of former Mexican President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON> was held without bail today as a witness in the 1985 torture-murder of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuno-Arce </PERSON> was flown from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday and ordered held pending a hearing next Monday. Investigators believe he has information about the slaying of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, according to papers filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot were kidnapped and slain after the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent led a series of damaging raids on marijuana plantations allegedly run by reputed Mexican drug lord <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro-Quintero </PERSON>. Zuno-Arce, whose sister is the wife of <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s president from 1970 to 1976, was arrested Wednesday night in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration agents as he tried to cross into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> An inspector recognized Zuno-Arce as one of those on a list of suspected drug traffickers, authorities said. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Handy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zuno-Arce </PERSON>'s lawyer, said he knows the <LOCATION> Mascota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, resident as a successful dealer in lumber and vegetables, with no history of drug trafficking. Zuno-Arce does not know <PERSON> Caro-Quintero </PERSON> `` except as a name in the paper like anyone else,'' Handy said. He called the unusual no-bail order `` a government tactic to in fact hammer on him, put him in jail and cause grief to his family.'' <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s slaying strained U.S.-Mexican relations, and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to bring in every person involved in the murders. Several members of the Mexican federal police force were linked to the killings. One was convicted last year. Eight more men are charged with murder and conspiracy in the case, including <PERSON> Caro-Quintero </PERSON>, who is in custody awaiting trial in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot are believed to have been killed at <LOCATION> Caro-Quintero </LOCATION>'s home in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>.

 British authorities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have installed ladders along the bank of a river where East Germans have tried to swim to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a British spokesman said today. Diplomatic spokeswoman <PERSON> Biddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooks </PERSON> said the ladders, which are like those used in swimming pools, were installed `` for humanitarian reasons.'' However, she declined to say they were specifically aimed at helping escaping East Germans climb out of the water. `` Our purpose is to help anyone in the water, however they got there,'' the spokeswoman said. The ladders and a stretch of rope were placed last week on the western bank of the <LOCATION> Spree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the British sector of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, she said. Communist East <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> lies on the other side of the river. During one dramatic escape attempt in February, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Notev </PERSON> was grabbed by East German border guards in a patrol boat after he had touched the western bank of the Spree. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> protested, saying the 21-year-old East German man had already reached the West although he was still in the water. <PERSON> Notev </PERSON> was sentenced to prison, but <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> reversed itself and freed him after the Western protests. He was sent to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on June 21. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was split into sectors controlled by Western allies and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the end of World War II.

 Troops today stormed a prison and killed 16 convicts who had taken 15 members of a religious group hostage in an escape attempt and murdered five of them, including a teen-ager. The bloody assault ended a three-day standoff at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and came five hours after the convicts tried to flee by using hostages as shields. During the attempted break, five hostages escaped but a 16-year-old female captive died, along with one convict, officials said. The remaining 15 inmates then retreated to the jail compound. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON>, the regional military commander, said officials decided to storm the jail after the escaped hostages told them some captives had been slain. In all, five hostages died. <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON> said none died in the police assault. The hostages were seized Sunday during religious services at the downtown jail in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. One of those slain was missionary <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, Australian, who had been working in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> since last month. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> So </PERSON>, a nurse at <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> Doctors' Hospital, said Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> was pronounced dead on arrival after the assault. All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group that conducted a prison ministry. The inmates, including murderers, asked for a getaway vehicle and gave authorities a 4 p.m. deadline to meet their demand. Maj. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Inciong </PERSON> of the military's <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> and other female captives were sexually molested by their captors. Officials said about nine of the hostages were women. Military and civilian negotiators had been holding talks with the inmates since late Sunday in an effort to peacefully resolve the crisis. But about 10 a.m. today, military spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the inmates announced they were leaving the detention center with their prisoners. `` The hostage takers started firing when they broke out,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` Heavy firing ensued.'' Convict leader <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Naser </PERSON> <PERSON> Samparani </PERSON>, a former air force soldier serving a 27-year sentence for murder, was killed in the attempted escape, along with hostage <PERSON> Julieta </PERSON> <PERSON> Verzosa </PERSON>, 16. After the first burst of gunfire, the inmates remained holed up inside the compound until the military attacked. Before the assault, reporters could see four bodies, three male and one female, stacked up in the area controlled by the inmates. It appeared the four had been slain after the breakout failed. On Monday, former Rep. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Dureza </PERSON>, who was negotiating with the gunmen, said <PERSON> Samparani </PERSON> threatened to `` waste all my bullets into the Australian'' unless officials provided the convicts with a getaway vehicle. There were conflicting reports about how the hostage drama began. Justice Undersecretary <PERSON> Silvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> said the convicts overpowered a guard and then looted an armory for weapons. But the Rev. <PERSON> Jamuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ducurme </PERSON>, who had attended Sunday's prison services, said the incident began after <PERSON> Samparani </PERSON>, a prison trusty, asked to take food to the wife of a soldier who lived next to the jail. <PERSON> Samparani </PERSON> returned a few moments later with an M-16 rifle, fired warning shots and seized the hostages, <PERSON> Ducurme </PERSON> said. The pastor said he was allowed to leave. Police said most of the inmates were believed to have been from a group that escaped in April from the <ORGANIZATION> Davao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colony </ORGANIZATION> and seized several hostages to protest conditions at the prison. They surrendered after being promised they would be transferred to the Muntinlupa prison, in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb, but the promise was never fulfilled. Officials said later the promised transfer could not be carried out because the inmates faced additional charges in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in connection with the penal colony escape.

 A barrage of rockets crashed down on the capital's airport today, injuring a soldier, forcing passengers to scurry for cover and disrupting flights, airport officials said. Such attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, which have occurred almost daily since late June, have been blamed by the government on U.S.-backed guerrillas. The guerrillas say they attack only military targets. Several other rockets also struck other parts of the capital today, but there was no immediate word on casualties. One airport official said nine rockets hit the airport. Several struck near the main passenger terminal during busy morning hours, airport officials said on condition of anonymity. They reported one government soldier injured. They said no passengers were injured and a runway was slightly damaged. There was no report of damage to civilian airplanes. The airport also has a military section, and it was not known if anything was damaged there. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said today that 299 rockets had been fired on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in the past four weeks, killing 188 civilians and injuring 483.

<HEAD>Bones Show Indians Led Harsh Life Under Spaniards But Lived Longer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study of the skeletons of 268 Indians buried in the 17th century on <LOCATION> Amelia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> shows they were overworked and underfed by their Spanish masters, scientists say. But the researchers are puzzled because the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> lived longer than ancestors who were better fed and did n't have to carry burdens for the Spanish, said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, supervisor of the archaeologists. The study of the bones, she said, showed that the Guale and <ORGANIZATION> Yamasee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' diets were nutritionally deficient and that they suffered from arthritis in their vertebrae and feet, indicating they had carried many heavy loads. `` What we have learned from this is that both the Guale men and women were used as bearers by the Spanish,'' Ms. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. The remains were unearthed at the sites of two mission graveyards. Excavation began four years ago when a backhoe, clearing land for a house, uncovered a graveyard. Researchers found that many of the Indians lived to what was then the ripe old age of 40, Ms. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. The Indians who lived in the area in the 1400s ate better but rarely reached that age. `` It's a contradiction that we have not been able to solve,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, who is writing a dissertation on the missions for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. Ten archaeologists from the university plan to excavate areas where once stood the house where the Franciscan missionaries lived; their cookhouse, and a circular structure that might have been part of the mission village. The scientists also will attempt to locate the site of the mission church.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High mortgage rates and rising prices continued to plague sales of existing homes in the second quarter, a real estate trade group reported today, with 41 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> posting declines. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said booming prices made housing most expensive on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and the Northeast in the April-June period. The median price of a home in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, the most expensive market, was $ 265,700, the Realtors said, compared with <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, which had the lowest median price of $ 47,700. The median price means half of the houses sold for more and half for less. The Realtors said their quarterly survey of sales of previously owned homes showed a seasonally adjusted annual resale rate of 3.72 million units, down 3.1 percent from the January-March quarter. <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said the sales reflected a lagging response to drops in interest rates that began in May. `` It took some time for the market to turn,'' he said. `` Now, the people who can afford to get in the market are house-hunting.'' But <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said the survey also indicates that home ownership is slipping further out of reach for first-time buyers in areas with expensive housing. `` High-cost areas are losing their entry-level market,'' he said, and in some high-cost markets, mortgage rates are forcing buyers to purchase less-expensive homes. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was the only area outside of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> ranking near the top of the price list. The nation's capital had a median price of $ 139,900 Ranked second in the median price list behind <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, with a price of $ 265,500, followed by <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, $ 247,600; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, $ 218,000; and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, $ 188,600. The report said 22 metropolitan areas recorded median prices exceeding the national median of $ 92,900 for the second quarter. Forty-three areas recorded annual median price increases exceeding the national price increase of 4 percent. By region, the West posted an 18.7 percent median price increase in the second quarter over the April-June quarter of 1988. It was followed by the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, up 4.9 percent; the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, up 4.6 percent; and the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, up 3.5 percent. The Northeast was the only region to post an increase in sales of existing homes, up 1.3 percent to an annual rate of 790,000 units, the Realtors said. The West, paced by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, registered a 7.2 percent decrease to a 640,000 annual pace. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s resale pace, 523,700 units and highest of all the states, dropped 14.9 percent. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, sales of existing homes fell 3.1 percent to a rate of 950,000 units and in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, they were down 2.9 percent to a resale pace of 1.35 million units.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' highest court reinstated murder charges against a man accused of killing a detective, despite what the justices called `` contemptible and disgusting'' police misconduct in the case. Police cheered the decision Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> can be tried for the 1988 slaying of <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>. But defense attorneys said the ruling would encourage police to fabricate evidence. Three <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> detectives threw the murder investigation into turmoil last spring when they admitted they had created a fictitious informant to obtain a search warrant for the drug raid in which <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> was shot. In March, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> dismissed the murder charge against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, 33, saying police had prevented a fair trial by repeatedly lying about the informant. Writing for the majority in the high court's 4-2 ruling, Justice <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said, `` In order to express its outrage at the reprehensible police conduct in this case, society need not punish itself by freeing a man who may be guilty of murder in the first degree and other serious crimes.'' <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said the `` contemptible and disgusting misconduct by police officers in blatant violation of their sworn duties'' would not prevent a fair trial. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, 36, was shot to death as he tried to break in the door of <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>'s apartment. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> has been in jail for more than a year awaiting trial. The three officers who testified about the fictitious informant have been suspended pending a perjury investigation. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> applauded the court's decision, saying he was happy for <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>' widow that <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> would be brought to trial He said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officers `` are ordinary human beings'' who work under extraordinary pressure. A lawyer for <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garin </PERSON>, said the ruling `` sets a precedent for toleration of massive perjury by the police and it vindicates them in their ` anything goes' strategy.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglate </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision will `` make it increasingly likely that police will be allowed to frame innocent citizens.'' In two dissents, Chief Justice <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Liacos </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the majority opinion essentially condoned police misconduct. `` Because of the officers' lies, the defendant languished in jail while court proceedings continued with what the court has characterized as ` perfidious' police conduct,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> wrote.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> today called for a joint meeting as soon as possible of the country's major political leaders to find a `` rational solution'' for the deepening governmental crisis. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he is willing to serve as prime minister `` if society wants it.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> welcomed Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s decision to give up trying to form a government, as one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s two minor parties endorsed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s bid to form the next government. The developments came one day after <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> offered to resign as prime minister in the face of opposition from Solidarity, and urged instead that pro-communist <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> form a coalition government that would include both communists and the free trade movement. Solidarity has rejected such offers previously, saying only a government headed by the opposition and dominated by non-communists will have the credibility necessary to solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political and economic problems. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> `` expresses his concern over the deepening instability of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political and economic situation,'' a communique on the state's <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced. `` The president intends to appeal to representatives of the main political forces in the country for participation in a joint meeting devoted to seeking rational solutions ... as soon as possible,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy particularly is in disarray, with industrial production falling, shortages of basic commodities common, its foreign debt at a burdensome $ 39 billion and growing and rising inflation. Associates have said that under such conditions that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> himself might be willing to serve as prime minister. In a statement issued by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today, he said: `` Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s declaration expressing readiness to resign ... was received by myself as resulting from a feeling of responsibility for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and a step opening new possibilities to solve the current government crisis.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who is not a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said his offer of a coalition government of Solidarity, the Peasants and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` is today the only chance to change the course of events dangerous for the country.'' Such a government, he said, would be `` a government of national responsibility, nominated with respect for the rights of the Polish president.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> apparently was referring to the constitutional rights of the newly elected <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to control foreign policy and the armed forces. Presumably, Solidarity would nominate for the defense, interior and foreign ministries only candidates acceptable to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Despite those assurances, the prospect of a Solidarity-led government has alarmed both the communist <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has said it could be destabilizing both for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Solidarity parliamentary leader <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> has said the party also fears a Solidarity-led government would purge a large segment of the `` nomenklatura'' _ party functionaries who hold tens of thousands of government and management posts. The nomination of <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>, a non-communist but long allied with the communists, was apparently the party's effort to offer an alternative to a Solidarity-led government that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s East bloc and party hardliners could not accept. The resignation of a communist premier because the opposition will not endorse his bid to form a government _ and the plausible attempt by Solidarity to form a government against the wishes of the Polish and Soviet communist parties _ demonstrates how radically <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc politics have changed. Such events would not have been thinkable even a year ago. <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> has not publicly replied to <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s suggestion that he form the government. But he already faces opposition from Solidarity and from within his own party, among others. If Solidarity would succeed in its push to win the prime minister's post, it would be the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc since the late 1940's. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, elected prime minister on Aug. 2, said he would contact <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and ask him `` to draw proper conclusions from the situation.'' Faced with the difficulty of winning a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> despite opposition from the Solidarity caucus that makes up 35 percent of the chamber, the longtime interior minister blamed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s proposal for prolonging and complicating the problem of forming a government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> announced Aug. 7 that he wanted to form the Solidarity-led coalition. His representatives commenced talks Thursday with the Peasant and Democratic parties, which hold the balance of power in parliament, amid signs the discussions were going positively. In essence, the Peasant and Democrat parties, once regarded as little more than communist fronts, have been thrown into the role of kingmakers because neither the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nor Solidarity has an absolute majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

 Masked rioters hurling gasoline bombs and rocks clashed with riot police in the streets of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> today, the 20th anniversary of the deployment of British troops in the city. Officers arrested an Irish-American activist. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, publicity director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was accused of violating a ban on entering British territory. Police say the group collects money to buy arms for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said the money is for families of victims of the province's violence. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police force, said three hours of pre-dawn violence occurred in the city's <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bogside </LOCATION> area, where two decades ago crowds barricaded streets in battles with police. Police fired dozens of plastic bullets to disperse rioters, who wore masks to hide their identities from authorities. Two men were hit but were not believed to be seriously hurt, police said. The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said at one stage gunshots were heard, apparently fired at police, and that officers later were reported to have fired in the air to scare off the rioters. Police said a small homemade explosive device was thrown at an armored police Land Rover, rocking the vehicle and breaking windows in nearby homes. The news agency quoted an unidentified local resident as saying rioters ran down a street throwing gasoline bombs and rocks: `` This is the worst -LRB- violence -RRB- we have had for four to five years. People were expecting trouble but no one knew what.'' Sporadic violence was also reported in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, 39, was bundled into a police jeep and driven away after taking a well-publicized walk through <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> would be flown to the British mainland and handed over to immigration officials. The spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was expected to be deported. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> has visited the province at least four times since 1984 despite being ordered by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to stay out. On Monday, several thousand <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters paraded peacefully through the <LOCATION> Bogside </LOCATION> neighborhood. They marched into the old walled city, a historic Protestant stronghold, and walked past the ruins of a building shattered by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb two days earlier. `` We've all risked our lives for 20 years and I say, fight on,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, once the top <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> commander in the city and now a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm here to pay tribute to the troops of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON> said. Earlier, he read off the names of 37 members of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Derry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> who have died since `` the troubles'' began in August 1969. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> was alone in taking such public notice of the 20th anniversary of the British troop deployment. The larger <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> party, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, ignored it. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON>, leader of the largest Protestant party, the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionists </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> used the day for a first meeting with the new secretary of state for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, the British Cabinet member responsible for the province. <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> said they had emphasized the opposition of Unionists, who support continued British rule, to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that guaranteed the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government a formal consultative role in the running of the province. `` We completely disillusioned the secretary of state that the <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> leadership was weakened in the protest and fight to end the agreement,'' <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> said. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> says the Anglo-Irish Agreement makes no difference to its guerrilla. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. The anniversary, and the preceding weekend, passed without any additions to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s sectarian death toll, which has surpassed 2,700 in 20 years. Security forces had feared the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> would attempt a significant attack to mark the date. On Monday, a high-ranking officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> contended that the violent incidents were spurred by news media attention given to the anniversary. `` I am honestly convinced that the presence of camera crews is keeping this going,'' said Chief Inspector <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>. There was no evidence, he said, that the incidents had been part of any larger pattern by any of the province's illegal paramilitary groups.

 Two cosmonauts will blast off Sept. 6 to reman the orbiting space station Mir after a four-month lapse dictated by finances and technical delays, space officials announced today. The new six-month mission by flight commander <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> will include a ride outside Mir in a new `` space motorcycle.'' <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, a veteran of two earlier space flights, and <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON>, who flew once before, are to blast off the night of Sept. 6 aboard a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur space center in the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, officials said. Mir, the showcase of the Soviet space program, was launched in February 1986. Though designed to be permanently manned, it was vacated April 27 when three cosmonauts rocketed back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Officials have said it was vacated to save money and because two new modules for the station were not ready. The Soviet space program has come under fire recently for heavy spending at a time when the country is suffering a $ 192 billion budget deficit and shortages of food and other basic consumer goods. A 20-ton module containing the space motorcycle, a new space shower and a new hatch for space walks will be launched in October and attached to Mir, <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the cosmonaut trainin center 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balandin </PERSON>, a backup engineer for the September flight, said the motorcycle is similar to a maneuvering unit used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle astronauts. The Soviet unit can travel 495 feet from Mir for up to three hours. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonov </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> Gagarin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmonaut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and a former spaceman, told reporters he had worked with Soviet engineers to develop a space motorcycle in the early 1970s, but the project deemed unnecessary and canceled. A second module with equipment to grow crystals in the weightlessness of space is to be launched in February, <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> said. The 20-ton Mir already has one module attached to it and a space observation laboratory. <PERSON> Balandin </PERSON> and cosmonaut <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> are to join <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> aboard Mir in early March, officials told reporters. Mir had been manned for a total of 880 days by four crews since its launch. Cosmonauts <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> broke space endurance records by staying a year before returning to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.

 The army said today that a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos is being held under administrative detention, which allows people to be jailed without being charged or tried. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must unconditionally release the cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, and indicated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not use its influence to free hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is free. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military censor, meanwhile, asked police to open an investigation into a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that two of three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are dead, said <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, spokesman for Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that an extensive investigation was underway to pinpoint the source of the report. Cabinet ministers will be investigated as well, it said. An army spokesman said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> cleric kidnapped by Israeli commandos on July 28, is being held for six months under an administrative detention order signed by Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>. He did not say where <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accuses <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> of coordinating attacks by the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Administrative detainees, generally Palestinians, are usually allowed to have a lawyer and appeal their detention. But the army spokesman, who is not identified under military regulations, would not say if <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> had such rights. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction July 28 worldwide attention after a radical Shiite group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> claimed to have killed an American hostage, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in retaliation. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has demanded the release of three Israelis missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as well as 16 foreign hostages in exchange for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and other Shiite Moslem prisoners. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, today dampened hopes his country might use its influence with kidnap groups to free the hostages. `` We hope that <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> will be released,'' he said after arriving in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for talks on the Lebanese war. `` This release should take place without any prior conditions _ no talks, no discussions before <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is released.'' On Sunday, the front pages of Israeli papers carried headlines quoting the Sunday Times story that two of the three missing Israelis were in fact dead. The story said intelligence officers questioning <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> have concluded that the two infantrymen died of wounds soon after their car was ambushed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in February 1986. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief army spokesman, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON>, did not confirm or deny the report but said the government considers its soldiers to be alive unless it is given documentary proof to the contrary. In another report on the hostage affair, The Independent of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Monday that <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction had sabotaged sensitive overtures by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to free the prisoners. The paper said the inner <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> appointed a three-man team to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> that consists of <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, chief coordinator of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; Gen. Ran <PERSON> Goren </PERSON>, head of the army's manpower branch; and <PERSON> Ori </PERSON> <PERSON> Slonim </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> lawyer and confidante of <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The team had `` opened new channels with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> via two Palestinan Shiites who have close links with <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION>,'' the paper said. Frustrated by the slow progress of negotiations, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> kidnapped <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, it said. It said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> expected the kidnapping to hasten the negotiations, but instead <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> broke off the contacts in anger. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, refused to comment on the Independent report. Other officials also declined to comment, saying the issue was sensitive. One security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the report was `` nonsense.''

 Police searched southwestern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> today for four kidnappers who flew to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> but then crosssed back over the border after <LOCATION> Paraguayan </LOCATION> authorities opened fire on their plane. Police chief <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontoura </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, a farming city 1,215 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, said police had found a truck stolen by the fugitives 25 miles southeast of the city. `` The truck had mechanical problems and was abandoned by the fugitives,'' <PERSON> Fontoura </PERSON> said by telephone. `` I think they're probably holed up in a house nearby, possibly with other criminals.'' The fugitives, identified as two married couples, kidnapped 9-year-old Said <PERSON> Agel </PERSON> on Aug. 3 in the central city of <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>. Police discovered their hideout, and the kidnappers exchanged the boy for a $ 42,000 ransom and three local television reporters who offered themselves as hostages.

 An air fare skirmish has intensified into a war, as major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines extend bargains on summer travel into the historically weak fall season. <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> started the move Sunday, announcing it was cutting round-trip fares by as much as $ 160 to lure passengers in the fall. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> also said it would lower certain international fares into next spring. The reductions were matched Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in markets where they compete with <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> went one better by matching the cuts for all the mainland <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities they serve, not only those where they compete with <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> would match <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s new fares to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on a competitive basis. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said early today his company had not yet decided on cuts for international fares. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also cut fares across its entire overseas network except for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manners </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The reduced fares are available for domestic flights from Sept. 9 to Dec. 15 and for international flights from Oct. 1 to May 21. Reservations must be made by Sept. 1. Air fares had been steadily rising in recent months amid strong passenger traffic and may have peaked for awhile, industry analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> started a round of cuts Aug. 2 when it reduced to $ 75 each way its weekend fares through Labor Day on most non-stop flights, and lowered transcontinental weekend fares to $ 100 each way. `` I think traffic is strong enough that -LRB- the new discounts -RRB- can put on some incremental passengers; it's free money,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. An unusual arrangement in the latest fare-cutting allows one change in travel dates Discount fares normally prohibit such changes. In addition, a `` lowest fare guarantee'' ensures that if fares are reduced further after a ticket is purchased, passengers will be refunded the difference. `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> wants to stimulate traffic during the historically weak fall travel period, and passengers who act now will be getting a great deal,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cozzi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president of marketing, said in a statement. The offer covers more than 100 cities worldwide, he said. Examples of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s new round-trip fares for travel on Tuesday and Wednesday are: <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-Dallas </LOCATION>, $ 148; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, $ 198; Chicago-Denver, $ 168; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio-Washington </LOCATION>, $ 198. Round-trip fares to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been cut by about $ 100. Examples of one-way fares from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> starting Nov. 1 are: <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, $ 149; <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, $ 199; <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, $ 189; <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, $ 213; and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, $ 232.

 The parents of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college student killed in a ritual slaying by members of a drug cult told President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today that for every drug user there are victims and suffering. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> were among about a dozen people meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and national drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as the administration prepares its first comprehensive strategy for fighting drugs, due out Sept. 5. The <ORGANIZATION> Kilroys </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` very sensitive'' to what happened to their son, who disappeared in the Mexican border town of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> while in spring break. His body was later found in a mass grave on a ranch outside the city, and had been dismembered by the drug cult, which believed that human sacrifices would protect their illegal activities. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the nation suffered with the <ORGANIZATION> Kilroys </ORGANIZATION> a couple of months ago, `` but since that time the <ORGANIZATION> Kilroys </ORGANIZATION> have taken their pain and their tragedy and turned it into a ... very good effort.'' The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, couple have founded the <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kilroy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said emphasizes education against the use of illegal drugs, and that the use of drugs causes much suffering. `` The government has to enforce the laws because right now people sell drugs, use drugs at will. I think that has to be at all levels, local state and federal,'' he said after the White House meeting. `` That's the one thing we said to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, there is a need for enforcement,'' <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said. `` I believe the drug dealers know exactly what they're doing and that they should be punished,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said even casual drug use has terrible effects. `` There is so much suffering we definitely should make every effort possible to see an end to it in our generation,'' <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did not issue any specific recommendations for fighting drugs, but she is satisfied the administration is `` moving in the right direction'' and praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> for asking others about what can be done. `` I think the federal government will do its part, but that all of us are going to have to do our part too. It's going to take the entire nation, everyone doing their part to rid our country of this terrible crisis,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Tuesday. Good morning. Let me first have a brief statement and then I'd be glad to respond to questions. I want to note again the passing of two outstanding public servants, Congressmen <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. They lost their lives in tragic aircraft accidents. Their passing is mourned by everyone who knew them. And <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I extend our sympathies to their families and friends during this difficult period. Their death also reminds us that there are outstanding men and women in public life who are working at every level of government to better the lot of mankind. And these two fine individuals represented a deep caring for the poor, the disadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and many other areas of our society that need improving. In the last two days, I've attended meetings to consider our new national strategy to deal with the drug problem. And it's an issue that tears at the heart and feeds the fears of every American. Just yesterday we learned that more than 75 percent of Americans say they favor tougher drug laws. Teen-agers find drugs the biggest problem facing their generation. And it's clear in these surveys and from hundreds of personal stories of tragedy that we hear every day that drug abuse is a national menace and that the central government must attack it with every means at its disposal. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has given me now an outline of our national strategy. It's balanced, decisive, effective and achievable, and it will target all aspects of the problem. It will call for commitment and sacrifice and understanding, but it's clear to me that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people demand no less. And we'll be working on the final points of this strategy over the next few weeks, and I'll present to the American people, on Sept. 5, a coordinated counterattack involving all basic anti-drug initiatives and agencies.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that the new drug-fighting strategy he will unveil next month is `` balanced, decisive, effective and achievable'' and said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people demand no less. The president, at a news conference, called attention to a new Gallup poll that found overwhelming numbers of teen-agers think drugs are the biggest problem facing their generation. `` It is clear in these surveys that drug abuse is a national menace and that the central government must attack it with every means at its disposal,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Asked if he was willing to raise taxes to pay for the anti-drug fight, the president said, `` We're not going to have to, but we are going to expand federal expenditures.'' Asked where the money was coming, he said, `` Stay tuned, and we will show you in September how we're going to allocate the resources for this.'' The poll, released on Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said teen-agers and adults alike view drug abuse as the most important problem facing the country _ eclipsing fear of war, the economy, AIDS, crime, abortion and alcohol abuse as top concerns. The president gave no specifics of what the new strategy, to be released Sept. 5 after he returns from his vacation, will be. `` This will be a rather comprehensive national strategy,'' he said. `` There is a little bit of good news out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There is a decline in the casual use of cocaine that's taking place.'' He said more can be done with education to counter the demand for drugs and that efforts to cut the supply line have also had some effect. One adult in four and one teen-ager in three has come to believe that drug abuse is the country's greatest problem, said the poll, and six in 10 teen-agers believe it is the greatest problem facing their generation. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the national drug policy coordinator, said Monday that the poll results `` give a very clear sense of direction'' to the administration in its strategy. `` In times of crisis such as war, the public is willing to make great sacrifices to the public good,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON>. `` In key ways today, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are in a wartime mode and sense a national emergency in the drug crisis.'' Only six years ago, in a similar poll, unemployment most bothered 53 percent of adults; drugs and drug abuse did not register. Four years ago it was the top concern of only 2 percent. In the telephone conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in June and July it was the top worry of 27 percent. `` In the 50 years that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public has been asked to name the most important problem facing the nation, it is virtually unprecedented for any social issue to appear at the top of the list,'' Gallup said. People are so disturbed, he said, that three-fourths of all teen-agers and nearly half of adults are ready to volunteer to help in drug prevention programs, education and treatment. `` A record number of Americans cite the drug crisis as the nation's top problem, replacing the ` guns and butter' issues of international tensions and economic worries,'' he told a news conference also attended by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. After drugs and drug abuse the top concerns by adults were poverty, homelessness and hunger, 8 percent; the economy in general, 7 percent, and the federal budget deficit and the environment, 6 percent each. Next came crime, inflation, other economic problems, and a decline in morals, each with 3 percent; then abortion, unemployment, the trade deficit and dissatisfaction with government, at 2 percent, and quality of education, 1 percent. Twelve percent of adults listed other problems at the top, and the rest said they had no answer. Fear of war, the category listed the most worrisome by 27 percent of adults in 1985 and 23 percent in 1987, was listed first by only 4 percent in the new survey. Drug abuse was listed by 32 percent of teen-agers as the most important problem facing the country, ahead of fear of war, 14 percent; economic issues, 13 percent; environment and pollution, 7 percent; political issues, 6 percent; AIDS, 5 percent; crime, 3 percent; abortion, 2 percent; and alcohol abuse, 1 percent. Nine percent of the teen-agers listed other concerns and the rest said they did n't know. Gallup interviewed 1,005 adults and 500 teen-agers in the telephone poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points for the adults and 6 percentage points for the teen-agers. In the new survey, 60 percent of the teen-agers questioned said drug abuse is the biggest problem confronting their age group _ nearly twice the number saying it is the biggest problem for the country. For their age group, 13 percent said the worst problem was peer pressures, 11 percent said alcohol, and 8 percent said teen-age pregnancy. Considered the top problem by 3 percent or less: school problems, teen-age gangs, problems in growing up, unemployment, teen-age suicide, getting along with parents and career uncertainties. AIDS and fear of war were listed first by less than 1 percent.

 But let me emphasize here that the federal government can not do it alone. Local communities and states and individuals and families must help. I'm being told in these meetings of the last few days that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are ready to take on this fight. Late August is a traditional vacation period, but we can not forget the full agenda that faces <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at this time: our hostages, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, drugs, the budget, and so many other matters. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering more than 100 of our nominees for government positions, and we need these people. And I urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make this a top priority when they come back. All of these issues will be on my mind as we prepare for the hard work of the fall. And so on this last day before vacation, I'll miss you, but _ let me just see _ Norm? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, your spokesman said yesterday that significant progress had been made in pursuing the issue of the hostages. We're told that you've been on the phone to foreign leaders, that there's been a flurry of diplomatic But can you say today that we're any closer to seeing the hostages released than we were, say, about three weeks ago when the Israeli seizure of <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> set into motion this chain of developments that seems to have raised expectations or hopes of a breakthrough? A. Norm, I ca n't say that today, but we're going to keep on trying. But I can not give you a definitive assessment of that. I just do n't know. There's a lot of lines out there, a lot of initiatives have been taken. As I said earlier, the cooperation that we've received, some that we've solicited and some unsolicited, from leaders around the world, it's just been magnificent. But I ca n't give you that, you know, positive assessment at this point. Q. Can I follow up on just one path that was pursued on that. In the absence of an exchange of prisoners, have you considered the extradition of <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> to this country to face criminal charges? A. No, we have no criminal indictment against <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Q. Is that any kind of a legal option? A. Well, we do n't _ we would n't move against somebody without the legal process going forward. Q. Mr. President, what does it mean when you pointedly remind <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that `` goodwill begets goodwill.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the return of the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. If that occurred, what would the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do in return for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>? A. Too hypothetical to answer, but I would simply repeat that we are looking for signs of change, certainly when it comes to holding of hostages. We all know that we've had some major differences with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the question of state sponsorship of terrorism. That's a given. Now, we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signals coming out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, some in the old mode and then some that offer more hope.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he ca n't offer any assurances that American hostages held in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> will be freed anytime soon, and said his administration continues to look for `` signs of change'' from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` I think that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> decided they wanted those hostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen, perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have to be hostile with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the rest of our lives,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke off diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a decade ago. At a pre-vacation news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was questioned repeatedly about the possibility of military action against those holding the hostages, and he replied that `` at some point we have to stand up for our interests, even if it means military, yet I'm not threatening military action.'' Later, he added, `` If I could find a way to take those hostages, get them, and bring them out and that required using the military force of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, make no mistake about it, I would do it in an instant.'' The president fielded questions for 30 minutes on subjects ranging from economic policy to drug abuse. On those topics, he: _ Refused to rule out kidnapping <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to bring him to trial on drug trafficking charges. `` I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' he said. _ Said he was `` comfortable'' with budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s weekend comment that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was keeping interest rates too high to permit sustained growth. _ Promised to return from his vacation in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> on Sept. 5 with a comprehensive plan to attack the `` national menace'' of drug abuse. He said his plan would include additional federal spending, but would not require higher taxes. _ Said he wished the `` legal process'' could move along in the case of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official suspected of espionage, `` without a lot of hype.'' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has not been charged. _ Called on the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to act speedily on more than 100 high-level government appointments that await confirmation. _ Eulogized Reps. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who died in recent days in separate plane crashes. He said the two were `` fine individuals -LRB- who -RRB- represented a deep caring for the poor, the disadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and many other areas.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was questioned repeatedly about the hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and the recent flurry of sensitive diplomatic efforts aimed at winning the release of the eight Americans held in captivity. He noted conflicting signals emanating from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in recent weeks. `` We do n't have to be hostile with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the rest of our lives,'' the president said. The hostages are thought to be held by the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> religious group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a faction heavily influenced by the Iranians. `` We're going to keep on trying but I ca n't give you a definitive assessment'' of whether the hostages are any closer to freedom, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't know. There's a lot of lines out there, a lot of initiatives have been taken,'' he said. Asked why he did not retaliate militarily after the murder of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still did not have adequate information to take either a diplomatic or military response. The Pentagon still is not certain when or how <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> died; on July 31, his captors released a videotape that showed him hanging from a makeshift gallows. `` I do not want to be responsible for the loss of innocent life,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that he was also concerned that an American response could lead to harm for the remaining eight hostages. He said that if he could mount an effective military rescue, `` I would do it in an instant.'' The president was asked whether he would consider seeking the extradition of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, whose capture last month by the Israelis outraged his religious followers. `` We have no criminal indictment'' against <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> in the kidnapping of Americans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We would n't move against somebody without the legal process going forward.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> generally endorsed <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s criticism that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was harming economic growth by keeping interest rates too high. `` I feel very comfortable with his -LRB- <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s -RRB- sallying forth,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think I have said the same things in the past.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped short of saying that if a recession occurred, it would be the fault of policies by the central bank. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went out of his way to emphasize his commitment to a new national plan for fighting drug abuse, and said it would take a `` full court press, not just in the federal government, but all across society'' to deal with it. He said drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has given him a draft proposal, and said the plan he unveils next month will be `` balanced, decisive, effective and achievable.'' He offered no details. On the hostage issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had received `` magnificent'' cooperation from world leaders, some of it unsolicited, but he did not identify anyone by name. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about his Inauguration Day comment that goodwill would beget goodwill in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relationship with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Now we see a new leader coming in and we hear different signals coming out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, some in the old mode, some that offer more hope. I would leave it stand that a clear and good signal would be the release of the American hostages.'' He added, `` I just hope that the positive signs prevail, because there are some, they are encouraging.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it would make a fourth attempt to ignite a booster engine needed to send the Hipparcos satellite into its designated orbit 22,320 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The European Space Operations Center in <LOCATION> Darmstadt </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said the attempt would be made made Thursday. The agency's previous attempts to activate the satellite's <ORGANIZATION> Apogee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> failed. Engineers have been unable to determine why the booster has failed. Hipparcos is designed to provide precise measurements of the stars. The satellite was launched Aug. 9 by the agency's Ariane rocket.

<HEAD>Irish-American Activist Arrested for Entering British Province</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An American pro-IRA activist was arrested Tuesday for violating a 5-year-old order barring him from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> territory, police said. Lawyer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, publicity director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION> NORAID </LOCATION>, was bundled into a police jeep and driven away after taking a high-profile walk through <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. The British government said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> would be deported after being flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and handed over to immigration authorities there. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> `` has no reason to alter his decision in relation to the exclusion order made in July 1984,'' the Home Office said. `` As an illegal entrant and the subject of an exclusion order, Mr. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> will be removed from the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>'s arrest came only hours after masked rioters marked the 20th anniversary of the arrival of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by throwing rocks and homemade bombs at police. Riot squads fired plastic bullets, slightly injuring two men, police said. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, 39, has visited <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> at least four times since 1984 despite being under a British exclusion order. He said he arrived for this latest visit three days ago. `` It would have been unconscionable for me not to have been with the nationalist people on the 20th anniversary of the arrival of the troops,'' he told reporters. The exclusion order against <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was signed in July 1984 following a speech at <LOCATION> Toomebridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, in which he encouraged violence the day after a soldier was killed in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. A month later, police tried to arrest <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> when he appeared on a platform of speakers in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Police killed a young man with a plastic bullet when fighting broke out in the crowd of thousands of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was lifted over the heads of people in the crowd and vanished up a back street. The ban is difficult to enforce because movement between <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> is easy. There are many unpatrolled roads across the border, no passport requirements and only random checks of cars. In the latest incident, officers grabbed <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> as he stood with officials of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, at <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Derry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION>, a symbol of Irish nationalist resistance to British rule. As he was led away, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> shouted: `` This will attract international attention!'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> NORAID </LOCATION> collects funds to buy arms for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> denies this, saying the money goes to families of victims of 20 years of violence in the province. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>'s release, saying the arrest was `` ironic testimony to British repression which relies upon exclusion orders, the denial of human rights and censorship, as well as military force to maintain its presence here.'' The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, said violence flared early Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Bogside </ORGANIZATION>, a Roman Catholic stronghold and scene of some of the worst sectarian violence when the `` troubles'' broke out 20 years ago. Police said one homemade bomb was thrown at an armored car, rocking the vehicle and breaking windows in nearby homes. In north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, a bomb exploded in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Ardoyne </LOCATION> area and a bus and a car were hijacked and burned. In <LOCATION> Coalisland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> County </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON>, a crowd of 30 people hurled gasoline bombs at the town's police station and a bomb exploded at a gas station in <LOCATION> Dungannon </LOCATION>, in the center of the province. Several thousand <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters marked the 20-year anniversary on Monday by marching peacefully from Creggan, another <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> stronghold, to <LOCATION> Bogside </LOCATION>. They walked into <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>'s old walled city, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> area, and past a building wrecked by an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb recently. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite the province and its Protestant majority with the predominantly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. More than 2,700 people have been killed in 20 years of fighting.

 While giving no specifics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that a new strategy to combat illegal drugs, to be released next month, is `` balanced, decisive, effective and achievable.'' He said, `` It will call for commitment and sacrifice and understanding, but it's clear to me that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people demand no less.'' The president said the government would be spending more money to attack drugs but would do so without raising taxes. He would not say where the money would come from.

<HEAD>Brakeman on Derailed Train Used Cocaine, Feds Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREELAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The brakeman on a train that derailed and caught fire July 22, forcing 3,000 people from their homes for up to a week, had used cocaine sometime in the 48 hours before the accident, a federal agency says. Blood and urine samples provided by the unidentified brakeman tested positive for the drug, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in a statement. Samples from the engineer and conductor tested negative. The agency did not say how much cocaine the brakeman had used and said it had not determined exactly when use occurred. `` His role in the cause of the accident, if any, has yet to be determined,'' said agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the brakeman was in the lead locomotive of the 37-car <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> train when 14 cars derailed and caused a chemical fire. Twelve people were injured. Two days later, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said, the brakeman admitted himself to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> determined that the first car to derail was an oversized flatbed. Investigators also discovered worn wheels and brakes and a variety of operating violations.

 The bodies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and the 15 others in his delegation were lifted off a mountainside in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> today, officials said. `` We've got them all,'' Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krejarck </PERSON> told reporters in the capital upon his return from <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION>, a town near the crash site. `` The site has now been cleared.'' The bodies, lifted one by one from the wreckage by helicopters hovering near the face of a sheer cliff, were flown to <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION>, where they were placed aboard an Ethiopian air force C-130 cargo plane for the return to the capital. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> said the bodies would be identified in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> by a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forensic experts, a process he said could take up to a week. Two C-130 Hercules cargo planes carrying rescue teams and fuel left the capital shortly after dawn for <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION>, about 35 miles southeast of the crash site, where joined two Blackhawk helicopters in the operation, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>. Heavy clouds, rain and low visibility were believed to have led to the crash of the Twin Otter carrying <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, eight other Americans and seven Ethiopians to the Fugnido refugee camp in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> on Aug. 7. Persistent bad weather also slowed the 6-day search as well as the recovery effort after the twin-engine plane was found Sunday, and the director of operations said the recovery operation could take two more days. `` The recovery is proving to be extremely difficult because of slippery rock, thick undergrowth and tall savannah grass,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Record </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> Monday night. `` The cliff inclines at an 80 degree angle.'' <PERSON> Gambela </PERSON> has served as the recovery coordination base since 12 bodies were found Sunday on the three-quarters the way up the slopes of a 5,500-foot mountain where the Twin Otter crashed, about 350 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. Record said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> had accepted an offer from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to participate in an investigation into the cause of the crash. He said a team of experts already was on its way to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, including representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> aircraft companies, which manufactured the plane's body and engine. The aircraft, which carries up to 20 passengers, was built by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havilland </ORGANIZATION>. A four-man congressional delegation also planned to fly to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to escort the bodies home but officials have said they will not leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until the bodies have been identified. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, 44, was on his fifth visit to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and his second this year when the accident occurred en route to the refugee camp, one of four in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees that house more than 300,000 Sudanese fleeing war and famine in their neighboring country.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today refused to rule out abducting <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to bring him to trial on drug-trafficking charges, say, `` I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice.'' The president also said at a news conference that he has told <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was widely considered the victor in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s May 7 presidential election that `` We will continue to support what the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> voted for. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vow of support for <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> did not put the administration at odds with an Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreement to promote new elections Sept. 1, conditioned on a transfer of power from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime to a transitional government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports that plan, although it continues to believe that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> fairly won the election, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The president was asked about comments he made in a recent <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> interview in which he seemed to indicate in answer to a question that kidnapping would be an acceptable option to bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to this country to face a federal indictments in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Asked today if kidnapping would be appropriate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We have an indictment out against General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for drug trafficking. I'm told that it's a good indictment ... I'm not saying what I would do or would n't do ... I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice.'' Mediation efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and economic and diplomatic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have failed to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to give up power. There are no indications he will step down as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler in the face of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> call for a peaceful transfer of power next month. `` I'm not holding my breath on his voluntary departure,'' the president told reporters. Asked what the administration plans are with regard to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he said, `` I do n't know for sure what we are going to do.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> unilaterally invalidated the May election, after initially claiming it was won by his handpicked presidential candidate. Various independent international and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer groups said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won the election by as much as a 3-1 margin despite widespread fraud allegedly engineered by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had recently told <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, `` who was duly elected by the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, that we will continue to support what the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> voted for.''

 A. Well, that _ if their justice system goes forward and there is a _ there is an indictment against him, I would be remiss if I did n't try to see him brought to trial. Q. Well, sir, ca n't you take the lead in that and encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to proceed? A. I've put it just exactly the way I want to put it. Q. Mr. President _ A. We've got to get to the back of the room here. We're _ yeah? Q. Can you explain why you have not retaliated for the murder of Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>? A. Retaliated for his murder? Q. Yes, sir. A. If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, private sector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostages out or guard against future hostage taking, I would take such action. Military action _ I'd like to know that what action we took was not going to victimize a lot of innocent people. And I'd like to be sure of all the facts before taking action on the <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> case. And I wish I could tell you we had all the facts, and we do n't. So, when you _ when you look at the action that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can take, I do n't want to _ I do n't want to be responsible for the loss of innocent life. I also must _ would have to weigh, if we considered military action, the lives of the Americans that were being asked to carry out that action. So, it's just not clear yet, but if I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and bring them out, and that required using the military force of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, make no mistake about it, I would do it in an instant. Yeah? Right in the back. You have a follow-up? Q. Yes. May I ask what you're doing to increase the intelligence that would let you do something like that? Have you ordered the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to try to get assets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>? A. Well, the problem there is it takes a long time. And I do think that the period that we went through quite a few years ago has resulted in less human intelligence than is necessary to come to grips with something as murky as hostage-holding. And so I'd like to do more, and the various agencies know of my interest in this, but I do n't want to hold out the wrong kind of hope that you can say, `` let's get more agents, more intelligence of the human source'' and that that happens overnight. It just does n't work that way. Yeah, way in the middle in the back, yes?

 Three teen-agers who collapsed and died while exploring an abandoned coal mine apparently were felled by suffocating gas so dangerous that `` all it takes is one breath'' to disable, a mine expert says. A fourth member of the group was in serious condition, suffering from oxygen deprivation. <PERSON> Blackdamp </PERSON>, a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen feared by miners, was detected in the mine Monday, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamanti </PERSON>, a mine manager who helped recover the bodies. `` All it takes is one breath of it and you're literally knocked down and you ca n't function. If somebody does n't pull you out, you're dead,'' <PERSON> Diamanti </PERSON> said. `` Your body quits working. Your mind does n't, but your body immediately quits working and you ca n't move.'' Killed on Sunday were <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossman </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrettner </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Folchert </PERSON>, 17.

Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Harms </PERSON> said the teen-agers, along with two others _ <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Slape </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 16 _ drove to the mine Sunday night. <PERSON> Slape </PERSON> told authorities he entered the mine first but came out when he had trouble breathing. `` The others did n't believe him so they went inside and they never came out,'' Harms said. <PERSON> Slape </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> heard their friends choking and tried unsuccessfully to re-enter the mine. Neither had keys to the two cars they had driven, so they ran and walked five miles through the desert to a motel to call for help. Rescuers found the bodies about 400 feet inside the cave, just beyond a pile of rubble they suspect kept the blackdamp inside the cave. They theorized that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, who was found atop the rubble, was high enough to avoid the low-lying layer of blackdamp.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid tribute today to two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members killed in recent plane crashes, calling them `` outstanding public servants'' who were `` working to better the lot of mankind.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened a question-and-answer session with White House reporters by recalling the deaths in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> of veteran Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> of freshman Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss. `` I want to note again the passing of two outstanding public servants ..., the president said. `` ...

Their death also reminds us that there are outstanding men and women in public life who are working to better the lot of mankind,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, alluding to <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s interest in alleviating world hunger and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s concern with the war on drugs and crime. Meantime today, the bodies of <LOCATION> Leland </LOCATION> and the 15 others in his delegation were lifted off the mountainside crash site in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, officials said. The bodies, lifted one by one from the wreckage by helicopters hovering near the face of a sheer cliff, were flown to <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION>, where they were placed aboard an Ethiopian air force C-130 cargo plane for the return to <LOCATION> Addas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> for identification procedures that could take up to a week. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was memorialized at a special service Monday, one day after searchers found the wreckage of his plane in a remote mountain ravine 100 miles from its destination near <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A South Korean student called `` the flower of unification'' by supporters returned home Tuesday from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, clutching the hand of a clergyman who came to escort her. Both were arrested. Im Su-kyong, 20, went to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> six weeks ago as a symbol of the peninsula's reunification and had been told she would be arrested for violating a law against visiting an enemy country. Tears streamed down Miss Im's face Tuesday as she addressed a small crowd a few yards from from the demarcation line in the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce zone. She said she was prepared for arrest. A South Korean soldier using a megaphone told her and the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyu-hyon </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to halt as they stepped over the raised cement line that bisects the oval-shaped <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> area. Miss Im dropped a bouquet of flowers she was carrying and grabbed <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s hand as they walked toward two South Korean border guards. The radical student left <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital, in a motorcade Monday, seen off by thousands of screaming people waving flowers. On Tuesday, what appeared to be much of the population of <LOCATION> Kaesong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, just outside the Demilitarized Zone, repeated the scene as her open limousine pulled away from a guesthouse and headed for the crossing. A loudspeaker van followed, blaring Miss Im's words of farewell. Just before crossing the line, she told the crowd: `` Reunification of our motherland will come in the near future if all Korean students <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and South struggle together. If there are forces that stand in my way, I will tell them of your sincere and peaceful desire for reunification.'' `` When our country is reunited, we will meet again!'' Miss Im shouted. A North Korean army officer, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiun </PERSON>, said, `` She is brave.'' She, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> and officials of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peaceful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comittee </ORGANIZATION> then linked arms and sang `` Our Wish Is Reunification,'' swaying from side to side. Several Westerners in the northern sector of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> were seen holding large placards that read `` <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one.'' Officials in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said Miss Im and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> were the first people to cross the border against the wishes of either government since the Korean war ended in 1953. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had said repeatedly that the crossing would violate the Korean Armistice Agreement. Officials of the U.S.-led <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a signatory to the armistice, said they would file a formal protest with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of the violation. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, consisting of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other nations that supported <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the 1950-53 war, has jurisdiction over the southern half of the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce area 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. North Korean reports quoted Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung </PERSON>, chief delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, as saying: `` Allowing them to go to the South through <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> is in full accord with the armistice agreement and the spirit of humanitarianism.'' Miss Im, who studies French at <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, entered <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on June 30 to attend the World Festival of Youth and Students in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. Her original plan was to return July 27, but she stopped short of the demarcation line when <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> refused permission, and went on a hunger strike for five days. North Korean officals said she became ill during the fast and had only recently been released from a hospital. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in June and returned there after a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he studies with the Maryknoll Order in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. After their arrests, Miss Im and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> were were flown to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by helicopter and she was given a medical checkup before being turned over to the national intelligence agency, South Korean officials said. They said the priest was questioned about his trip and about anti-South <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> statements he allegedly made while in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. If the two are convicted under the national security laws, they could receive prison sentences of up to 10 years, legal experts said. In a speech in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> marking both <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s liberation from Japanese rule and its division in 1945, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said the Koreas should `` recognize each other, seek coexistence and coprosperity and restore and develop a single national community through mutual opening-up, exchanges and cooperation.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also cautioned <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> against agitating radicals in the South. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> must realize that the only thing they can gain by agitating the extremists and radicals within our society and by enticing a few of them to secretly visit <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> is the abhorrence of our people,'' he declared. Dialogue between the nations has been sporadic. Several meetings were held during the past year, but negotiations bogged down after the illegal trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Chemical Dispersant Doesn't Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists have concluded that a kerosene-based chemical <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had concocted to remove oil from Alaskan beaches does n't work. A review committee determined that Corexit 9580MS generally is harmless to marine life but is of little value in lifting oil from rocky shorelines. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday the substance would n't be approved for use on crude oil spilled when the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran onto a reef in Prince William Sound March 24. The review committee, made up of representatives from state and federal agencies involved in the cleanup, has looked at hundreds of chemicals and cleanup techniques but so far has n't found anything better than the high-pressure washing that is becoming less effective as the oil weathers and hardens. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> is on the committee, as is the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. With <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s self-imposed deadline of Sept. 15 for the end of this year's cleanup rapidly approaching, Corexit 9580MS was one of about a dozen chemicals that under went extensive study as scientists sought a last-ditch solution. Environmentalists and state officials have been wary of the use of chemical dispersants, fearing they would simply break up the oil and distribute it through the water, where it would be more toxic than on the beach. Corexit is one of a variety of dispersant chemicals Exxon makes. The company tried a kerosene-based blend of the chemical that scientists hoped would break oil free from rocks but would n't dissolve it to the point it could n't be picked up by skimmers

 Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you've told us you're going to expand vastly the fight against drugs. Are you willing to raise taxes to pay for that? A. We're not going to have to, but we are going to expand federal expenditures. Q. Follow-up on that, Mr. President. A. Yeah. Q. If you're not going to raise revenues to fight the drug war, where are you going to get this money? Can you tell us specifically _ A. Stay tuned, and we will show you in September how we're going to allocate the resources for this. Q. And do I understand that this money will have to come from other federal programs now being funded? Can you tell us specifically where this _ A. Not yet. No, I ca n't tell you yet because the final decisions have n't been made. But we will have to do some reallocation of resources, there's no question about that. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>? Q. -LRB- Inaudible -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ A. Yeah? Q. _ Going back to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for a minute. On Sept. 1, there'll be an inauguration of the candidate that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supported, effectively institutionalizing what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> considers a `` stolen'' election. What is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> going to do now? Are we going to be limited to these kind of skirmishes that we saw last week, these arrests of one side or the other, or is there something else? A. I do n't know for sure what we're going to do. Part of our understanding of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> agreement was that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be _ would be out. And I'm not holding my breath on his _ his voluntary departure. But _ and I have told Mr. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was duly elected by the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> the other day, that we will continue to support what the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> voted for. But it's still rather murky as to what will happen beyond Sept. 1. There are some hints that possibly there will be a transfer. Let me just simply say this, I would reiterate that our argument is not with the Panamanian defense forces, it is with Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> himself, and that if he were to go out, and that you had the will of the people recognized, we would instantly have better relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>; it would be good for our country and certainly it would improve life for the Panamanians. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, in the middle. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, in the past you've said that the budget is very tight, there's not much room at the federal level for spending. Now you say that resources are going to be reallocated. Does n't that signal some hard times ahead for the military or the social programs or both?

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of traditionalist and right-wing Roman Catholics marched through the streets Tuesday in ceremonies of atonement for what they call the crimes of the French Revolution. The hymn-singing procession, with hundreds of colorful banners bearing royal and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> symbols, wound its way along a 2 -LCB- - mile route from the Louvre to the Opera and back via the stock market district Heading the procession was the Rev. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguerie </PERSON>, leader of fundamentalist Roman Catholics loyal to rebel Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, who was excommunicated by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> for consecrating bishops in his order without authorization. Organizers estimated about 30,000 people took part in the daylong events, which began with a traditional Latin Mass in front of the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> _ a former royal palace that is now a museum. The events were organized by religious fundamentalists and people identified with extreme right-wing politics, two groups that overlap in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a leader of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> who served in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from 1986-88, was among the spectators. He described the participants as `` the right wing, the hard core of our electorate. About 90 percent would be National Front voters.'' Authorities refused permission to hold the rally at the Place de la Concorde, where King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> was beheaded, but <PERSON> Brigneau </PERSON> said the square in front of the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> was just as appropriate. `` We are here in the heart of what was the Republic of fear, the Republic of terror, the Republic of the revolution,'' he said, noting that during the Terror, prisoners were taken from cells just across the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> in the Conciergerie in carts past the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> to the guillotine. `` There were many innocents, priests, men of the people, children who were killed,'' said <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Fath </PERSON>, who said she came from her home in <LOCATION> Montbronn </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> `` to atone for all the crimes committed in the Revolution.'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Arras </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said the official bicentennial celebrations this year were `` grotesque. They showed the desire of the authorities to continue to brainwash the people into thinking the revolution was good.'' Champion and Mrs. <PERSON> Fath </PERSON> said they were not necessarily advocating a return to monarchy. `` I'm not against democracy as such, as long as its founded on faith,'' Champion said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fath </PERSON> said she would prefer `` a just and pure king like <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' but could support a republican government `` if we had a good <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> president who outlawed abortion.'' The day ended with an appeal to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, asking her to accept `` a public rehabilitation of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which seems to have abandoned its Christian vocation for the past 200 years.'' The vow was a renewal of King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON>'s consecration of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> in 1638, which he ordered to be made every year on Aug. 15. `` We are ardent and convinced counterrevolutionaries,'' said <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigneau </PERSON>, an editorialist for the extreme-right weekly <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebdo </ORGANIZATION>, in a welcoming speech. Calling attention to a 13-foot replica of a guillotine on one side of the square, <PERSON> Brigneau </PERSON> said it was symbolic of `` our hostility to a bicentennial which insists on recounting a tragedy with cheerful words, and on glorifying the executioners without a thought to honoring the victims.'' The procession marked the feast of the Assumption, when Roman Catholics believe the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s body and soul were taken up into heaven after her death. A simultaneous but smaller procession, also with a statue of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, took place outside <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> a few blocks away under the auspices of Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

 A. Yes. We're in a period of hard times in the sense that we do n't have all the money that we would like to spend in several areas. So, it is n't easy. And I'm determined, though, to get this federal budget deficit down and to live within the Gramm-Rudman targets and to do it without threatening this long expansion by raising taxes on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>? Q. Have you made no final decision on what programs are going to get the pinch on _ A. No, the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> is working on that right now. Yes? Q. The last administration also made the fight against drugs a major priority, and yet drug interdiction efforts have not slowed the distribution of crack cocaine. People in this country still think drug abuse is a very major problem. What can you do differently now that you're president than the last administration or even prior administrations to turn this problem around? A. Well, the drugs _ in the first place, we're formulating a national drug strategy. And though we've approached _ in the previous administration we approached various parts of it, this will be a rather comprehensive national strategy. You point out the bad side of it, and it is horrible, no question. There is a little bit of good news out there, and that is the decline _ a decline _ a serious decline in the amount of casual use of cocaine has taken place. This encourages, because I think with better emphasis on education, we can do more on the demand side. On the interdiction side, we are going to have some specifics in that that I think will help get to the problem at the source. So, you learn. I salute the interdiction people who have done a good job, but we're just trying to improve on it, make it better. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>? Q. Can I follow that _ A. Yeah, here _ Q. Can I follow that up? A. Yeah, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, please follow up there. Q. I know there's talk about using military assistance to provide <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to help cut down on drug trafficking. Can you tell me if you would consider deploying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in these countries to help in that effort? A. Well, I have said previously, way back in the campaign, that I would give serious consideration to an invitation from countries to help them. And I'll tell you what I found at this G-7 meeting. It was a very interesting _ from several of the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders, the feeling that maybe we ought to have some kind of international effort to help countries in this regard, going after people where _ in a country, at the invitation of a government of a country, people that have been out of the reach of the law enforcement _ of the local _ of the local _ of the country itself _ of the government.

The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s top newspaper blasted `` nationalist hysteria'' in the Baltic region and blamed a law passed by <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet parliament for igniting labor unrest among ethnic Russians and other non-Estonians in the republic <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet government daily, reported that the workers' protest, in its seventh day, has shut down another mine in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, and that railway employees walked off the job at a station at <LOCATION> Yulemiste </LOCATION> That means all rail freight stations around <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s capital, have been paralyzed by the strike, with more than 3,000 rail cars standing idle, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said To assure the flow of supplies to the city of 480,000 people, goods are being shipped to other cities in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, the paper quoted the republic's deputy premier, <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palu </PERSON>, as saying. `` That way, we'll supply <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> with everything needed,'' he said <PERSON> Maarika </PERSON> <PERSON> Saarna </PERSON>, an editor with Estonian state radio, said from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> that at last report, 26,000 workers at about 40 enterprises in the republic of 1.5 million people were believed to be on strike. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON>, a member of the strike committee, said by telephone that `` thousands'' of ethnic Russians at some 50 factories were staying off the job. The strike began one day after <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s lawmakers adopted a law limiting voting to adults who have lived in the same district for two years, or anywhere in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for five years. Candidates for elected office must live in the same place for five years, or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said the law will take the right to vote away from more than 100,000 recent non-Estonian arrivals _ the precise goal pursued by the law's advocates, who fear an influx of outsiders will make ethnic Estonians a minority in their own homeland. In its tough commentary, Pravda aimed its criticism at the law rather than the strikers, saying `` the passage of discriminatory acts has an extremely destabilizing influence on the political situation.'' In <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and its two Baltic neighbors, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, `` a situation is building up of nationalist hysteria,'' the paper said. On Monday, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> called for ethnic Russians to negotiate their differences with the republic's authorities and end the strike, which <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said has cost the Soviet economy millions of dollars. However, <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> said in an Estonian TV interview that an initial round of negotations with protesting workers Monday did not succeed in resolving the strike, and called for more. He admitted the rights of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s minorities had not been taken into account, and added `` this is our mistake and it must be rectified.'' Russians and other migrants make up about one-third of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s population. Ms. <PERSON> Saarna </PERSON> said two sets of negotiations were taking place Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, at the Estonian party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and with members of the Moscow-based Supreme Soviet legislature's commission on interethnic relations, who flew to <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> to try to calm tempers and end the strike. Ms. <PERSON> Saarna </PERSON>, an ethnic Estonian, defended the new election law from criticisms published by Pravda and in other Moscow-based media. `` They forget every civilized country has a citizenship,'' she said. `` We are fighting for staying alive as a nation. They act as though the poor Russians only had this place -LRB- <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> -RRB- to live in.'' In the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> _ two other Soviet areas threatened by nationalist labor unrest _ officials said all was quiet Tuesday. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists called off a strike they had considered for Tuesday, according to Gruzinform, the official Georgian news agency. An activist said the strike was postponed until Sept. 1 because the government promised it will identify and take action against instigators of violence in one district of the republic, <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, by then. At least 20 people died in the violence last month. Finding and punishing those responsible has been the <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists' main demand. In <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, where six factories in the capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> were reported on strike Monday and 10,000 people demonstrated Monday night, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said life was back to normal Tuesday.

 Syrian troops pounded defense lines around the country's besieged Christian enclave with artillery and tank fire today in what police feared was a softening-up barrage before a major ground offensive. Sixteen people were kiled and 86 wounded, police said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, in an extraordinary move, today called an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to arrange a cease-fire. There was no immediate word on when the council would convene. Police reported clashes between Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces in three provinces. Both sides battled with artillery in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, hitting residential neighborhoods in the eastern Christian and western Moslem sectors. The latest casualties raised the toll in the fighting that broke out March 8 to at least 757 dead and 2,036 wounded. The Syrians, outnumbering Christian forces by two-to-one, were reported massing troops and Soviet-built T-72 tanks in the central mountains that form the eastern flank of the beleaguered enclave. The action appeared to be seeking to stretch Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces, who two days earlier repelled an attack on a mountain outpost overlooking the capital. The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio meanwhile reported <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes blasted targets shortly after noon today near the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, but police had no immediate confirmation. The Syrians have about 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate and have sided with a Moslem government that rivals the Christian government headed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands about 20,000 fighters. A police spokesman said fighting flared across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line, in the mountains southeast of the capital and on the northern flank of the Christian enclave. The spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing regulations, said the Syrians `` want to shatter <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and weaken their supply lines. They want <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to fight a war on several fronts at the same time.'' The Syrian moves were `` an apparent preparation for a new attack on <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s defenses'' following an abortive attempt to storm the Christians' strategic Souk el-Gharb strongpoint, 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> two days ago, he said. The mountaintop outpost, besieged by Moslem forces since 1983, controls a network of roads twisting through the mountains into the Christian heartland north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian gunners in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains southeast of the capital and in Syrian-controlled north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> hammered <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s defenses with 130mm howitzers and tanks. Police said shells were falling on Christian positions at a rate of five a minute. Two unidentified warplanes flew over the Christian perimeter at high altitude, releasing scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking missiles. But they drew no fire. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Christian artillery were targeting Syrian troop concentrations in the central mountains and the Druse Moslem villages facing Souk el-Gharb. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces were `` determined to foil all attempts to storm through our lines, even before they launch an attack,'' the spokesman said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies for the continued warfare in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said the bloodshed makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to gain the release of American hostages held by Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems there more difficult. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tlass </PERSON> was quoted by the Al-Watan daily as saying <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> will supply its Moslem allies with all the weapons, including surface-to-surface missiles, they need to defeat <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops and right-wing militia allies. Syrian and Christian gunners shelled residential districts of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> intermittently through the morning, bringing to a standstill what little life there was left in the devastated capital. An estimated 90 percent of the city's population of 1.5 million has fled the last few weeks, leaving only about 150,000 people huddled in underground shelters. A few bakeries that have not been hit or closed down were open, but few civilians risked being caught in the open to line up for bread. `` There are only a few people still in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> anyway,'' said <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zebib </PERSON> at the sandbagged entrance of his west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> bakery. `` We only allow five people to wait for bread at the entrance. We do n't want a large crowd to avoid casualties in case we're shelled,'' he added The Telecommunications Ministry appealed for its technicians to `` report to duty immediately to repair telephone and telex lines that suffered severe damage during the shelling.'' The current round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war broke out when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. His attempt to restore long-eroded government authority over the militias, whose ports siphoned an estimated $ 100 million a year in customs levies from the state treasury, triggered retaliatory shelling by the Syrians and their allies.

 Seven thousand relatives of war victims paused for a minute of silence Tuesday on the anniversary of World War II's end, and Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> prayed for world peace. At least 10 members of the Cabinet of new Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> marked the day by making visiting the Shinto shrine for 2.4 million of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 3.1 million war dead _ including 14 convicted war criminals. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> himself did not visit the Yasukuni Shrine. Opposition political parties and other groups in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> say such visits violate the constitutional separation of religion and state and promote militarism. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, attending a ceremony at a martial arts hall near the Imperial Palace, stood before 25,000 white and yellow chrysanthemums and bowed deeply, with Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> at his side. `` Looking back, it has already been 44 years since the end of the war, and in the midst of the peace and prosperity of today brought about by the untiring hard work of the people, when I recall the times replete with hardship, my mind is filled with a thousand emotions,'' <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> said. `` On the occasion of this day, in remembrance of the war victims, I think of the many people who lost their lives and of their families, and I am deeply saddened,'' he told relatives of war victims. `` I pray, along with all our people, for the future development of our country and for world peace,'' he said. The late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>'s father, announced to the nation on Aug. 15, 1945, that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would surrender to the allies. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> led Tuesday's ceremony in a minute of silence at noon, the exact moment that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s voice was broadcast. About 90 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also visited the <ORGANIZATION> Yasukuni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Last year, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> did not visit <LOCATION> Yasukuni </LOCATION> on the war anniversary. His predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, visited the shrine in 1985 but later discontinued the visits because of strong opposition from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other neighboring nations. The Chinese and other nations in the region are wary of any signs of growing Japanese militarism. In a prewar conquest, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> seized <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1931. In his statement marking Tuesday's anniversary, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said, `` Those who did not return did not die in vain, as we take the lessons of the war closely to heart and pledge to work for world peace and the prosperity and harmony of our country in international society.''

 So, we have no specifics on that at this point. But generally speaking, we have used military assets, as you know. We've used helicopters, for example, in, I believe it was <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and perhaps <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. And we're _ we're _ we're interested in all of this, but I do n't think you can inflict force on a country, and I would n't _ I would n't want to be a part of that at all Yeah? Q. Mr. President _ Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you talked about conflicting signals coming out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a result of your diplomatic efforts _ A. Well, I'm not sure it's a result of it, but there are conflicting signals coming out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Q. Coincident with _ A. OK. Q _ your diplomatic efforts. I'd like to ask, do you believe that President <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is firmly in charge in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>? How long are you prepared to give this diplomatic process before trying some other means or effort? A. Well, please elaborate. What do you mean, `` before trying some other means''? I'm not sure _ Q. Well, there are those _ there are those who believe that there should be stronger military messages _ A. Yeah. Q. _ sent. A. I do n't know the answer to your first part of it, and I do n't know any expert in this government that does I had a meeting with various agency experts on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and I think the jury is still out as to the _ what has happened internally there in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. I think all our experts feel that there are some hopeful signs, and I would cite some of the comments by Mr. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. And then, you've seen some countersigns, one as recently as yesterday by Mr. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>. And there are others _ their interior minister who seems to be very hard over. So, I think we do n't know yet _ we do n't know how it is sorting out. But again, I would go back to the earlier answer, that that's fine, that can move forward But if I find some other channel or action that would get our hostages out of there, I would n't wait on sorting out the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Yeah? Q. If I can follow, though, just how long are you prepared to wait? And would you consider stepping up military pressure in this process? And to what extent do you hold <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responsible for the safety of these hostages? A. Well, again, we're trying to sort out _ there certainly _ I think that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> decided they wanted those hostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen _ perhaps not with certainty, but a good likelihood.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Elderly Can Have More Control Over Memory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Older people who accept the stereotype that they're supposed to be forgetful are more likely to be so, a researcher says. `` A younger person is likely to attribute memory problems to inattention or a task being difficult, while an elderly person often says, ` Well, I had trouble with that because I'm old,''' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> psychology professor and author of the book `` Memory Fitness Over 40.'' In a new study, Ms. <PERSON> West </PERSON> hopes that combining memory-improving techniques with a different set of beliefs about aging will bring long-term changes. `` We're not going to try to convince people that aging does n't change memory _ it does,'' she said Monday `` If older adults avoid memory tasks, they're likely to lose these skills because their lifestyles often are less demanding than those of younger people,'' <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. `` Their boss is n't asking them to do a complex job and they are n't supervising their children's activities.'' The first memory skill people are likely to lose as they get older is mental speed. Other early problems are difficulty concentrating and retrieving information, such as feeling someone's name is on the tip-of-the-tongue, she said Imagery is one technique Ms. <PERSON> West </PERSON> suggests to improve memory. Grocery lists can be memorized, for example, by matching pictures of food with each item on the list and mentally linking the pictures, she said. `` Older adults have as many stereotypes about aging and memory as young people do,'' she said. `` Many believe that age brings memory decline and that it is more pervasive and serious than it often is.''

 And so, as you know, the position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government has been that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and a couple of other states have been involved in the state sponsorship of terrorism. And so, I do n't think it's a question of how long, it's a question of not _ in my view, it's a question of exploring every avenue to get these people back and recognizing that at some point we have to stand up for our interests even if it means military. And yet, I'm not threatening military action because I've told you some of the constraints on authorizing military action. Q. Your budget director said over the weekend that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> ought to be a little bit less concerned about inflation and more concerned about recession and perhaps let loose on interest rates. Do you agree with that? A. Listen, I do n't know of any president, now or in the past, who does n't favor lower interest rates. That is _ that's the American way. But you also have to be concerned about inflationary pressures. I thought what <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said was very balanced and very _ I can feel very comfortable with his sallying forth and saying that. And I think I've said essentially the same thing in the past. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> also suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might be responsible for any recession down the road if interest rates do n't come down. Do you agree with that, sir? A. Well, I'd like to go back, because I do n't recall that part of it, and take that under advisement and let you know at a later date. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Yeah? Q. Mr. President, are you _ what is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> doing, if anything, to try and stop the destruction of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that's under way? Is this _ is it a fear that if the Syrians succeed in driving the Christians out, that would seriously set back any progress that's been made on settling the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> problem? A. The answer to your last question is yes, and the answer to the first part is joining others in calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces; support for the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mission, which regrettably has hit an impasse right now, but encouraging those three countries involved to re-energize that initiative; joining, where we can _ I had a long talk with the secretary general to see what role the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can play. And indeed, I might take this opportunity to thank him for his timely dispatch of his emissary to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ although that was n't a mission about <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, it had to do with Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. I was deeply appreciative of his taking that action. So, we are in a very complicated situation in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where I am not sure any outside power can do other than exort people in the country to have the cease-fire, and to withdraw foreign forces, and then to take a look at whatever constitutional change is necessary so you have a representation there that all factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> can feel comfortable with. And it's a long process. And in the meantime, I am literally heartbroken _ I have bored some of you with this, but I have been to the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when I was in business, and I recall it as the peaceful oasis in a then-troubled <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. And I saw Christians living peacefully with the Muslims, and some day, again, I would like to think that the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> can be restored to that.

 Two cosmonauts will reactivate the Mir space station in September after four months in <LOCATION> mothballs </LOCATION>, and they'll try out a new `` space motorcycle'' and shower, and install a docking port for the Soviet space shuttle, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON>, the flight commander, and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, the flight engineer, are to blast off Sept. 6 to resume the Soviet manned space program that was put on hold because of tight finances and technical delays. Among the highlights of the six-month mission will be a ride outside Mir in a `` space motorcycle.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balandin </PERSON>, a backup engineer for the flight, said the motorcycle is similar to the manned maneuvering unit used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle astronauts. It can travel up to 50 yards away from Mir for 2-3 hours at a time, he told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Gagarin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmonaut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet officials have said cosmonauts will use the craft to inspect Mir's exterior, repair satellites and as a rescue vehicle. Mir, the showcase of the Soviet space program launched in February 1986, was designed to be manned permanently but was unexpectedly vacated April 27, when three cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Officials have said the Mir was mothballed to save money and because two new modules _ including one containing the motorcycle _ were not ready. The Soviet space program has come under fire for lavish spending at a time when the country is suffering a $ 192 billion budget deficit and chronic shortages of consumer goods and food. <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> said the lapse in the program saved an estimated $ 32 million, including the cost of a supply ship that would have been needed as well as a crew transport capsule and rocket booster. `` Unfortunately, the calculations are such now that when a cosmonaut does n't fly, we economize and it's advantageous. We're working toward a situation where a cosmonaut flies and there will be only profit,'' said <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, another backup cosmonaut for the mission A 20-ton module containing the cycle, a new space shower and wider, more comfortable airlock for space walks will be launched in October and attached to Mir, <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> said. The cosmonauts plan to try out the new cycle at some point during the mission while wearing a new, more flexible spacesuit. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonov </PERSON>, the training center's deputy director and a former cosmonaut, said he had worked with Soviet engineers to develop a space motorcycle in the early 1970s but the project was canceled `` because some wise guy said it was n't needed.'' A second module with a special docking port to receive the new Soviet shuttle Buran and equipment to grow crystals for electronics in the weightlessness of space is to be launched in February, <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> said. Buran, a carbon copy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, flew for the first time in November without a crew. <PERSON> Leonov </PERSON> said the shuttle wo n't fly again until 1991 at the earliest, and then will be launched without a crew to link up with Mir using the new docking port. It could return to Earth carrying cosmonauts, <PERSON> Leonov </PERSON> said. The 20-ton Mir already has one module attached to it, a space observation laboratory called Kvant. Mir has docking ports for three more modules. <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, a veteran of two flights, and <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON>, who flew once before, are to blast off at night aboard a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur space center in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leonov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Balandin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> are to join the two aboard Mir in early March and work with them for a week, said <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON>, 43. He said he and <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, 45, will then return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Mir has been manned for 880 days since its launch, with four resident crews. Cosmonauts <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> broke space endurance records by staying aboard for one year.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Says Iran Has Nothing to Do With Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister repeated his nation's frequent denial of any link with hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but he also indicated Tuesday that talks might follow if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> frees a kidnapped Shiite Moslem cleric. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adopted a conciliatory tone, saying in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> have it in their power to get American hostages released and rejoin the `` family of law abiding'' nations. Sixteen Westerners are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans, and most are believed held by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, thought to be among the `` pragmatists'' led by President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said talks with the Syrians `` will not have anything to do with the hostage issue since this issue does not concern us.'' He spoke to reporters after meeting with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON>. Official media in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> indicated, however, that President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and other Syrian leaders were pressing the Iranians for action on the hostages. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in which a truce was reached a year ago. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must free the pro-Iranian cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, without conditions. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> kidnapped <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28. It has offered to trade him and hundreds of other Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the Western hostages. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` We do n't have to be hostile with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the rest of our lives. We've had a good relationship with them in the past. They're of strategic importance. They'd be welcome back into the family of law-abiding, non-terrorist-sponsoring nations.'' He said the best signal <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of its intention to improve relations would be to bring about the release of the Americans. `` I think that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> decided they wanted those hostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In another apparent signal to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> it would be willing to participate in a suit brought by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in July 1988 by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, who arrived Monday for talks on the fighting between Syrians and Chrstians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said: `` We hope <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> will be released. This release should take place without any prior conditions _ no talks, no discussions before <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is released.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has been instrumental in past hostage releases and has promised <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to help resolve the crisis surrounding <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction After talks with the foreign minister, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and delivered a letter from <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who has indicated flexibility on the hostage issue since his inauguration the day <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was kidnapped. The contents were not disclosed. Accompanying <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> was one of his deputies, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON>, a hard-liner with close links to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the group thought to sponsor Shiite kidnap gangs in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> was a leader of Iranian militants who stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in November 1979 and held 52 Amricans hostage for 444 days. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also met in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leaders, including <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, the movement's spiritual adviser. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said Friday that all hostages should be freed. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to release businessman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> after nearly four years of detention so he can attend his mother's funeral Saturday. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 53, was detained in November 1985 for overstaying his visa and later was accused of spying, but no charges have been filed. His mother died Aug. 3. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspapers denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, an English-language daily, said for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` pin hopes on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s assistance'' to free the hostages `` without respecting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s conditions is wishful thinking.'' It said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejects indirect talks through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, an Islamic neighbor with which <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is forging new links, because of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s `` insolent tone.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a three-day visit. <PERSON> Kayhan </PERSON> said the release of billions of dollars in Iranian assets the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze in 1979 would `` be taken only as a goodwill gesture,'' not as an trade-off for help in freeing the hostages. <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION>, a radical daily, said: `` The return of Iranian assets and properties is the indisputable and lawful right of the Islamic republic and is not something to be bargained over.'' Last week, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be willing to help free the hostages if the assets were released.

<HEAD>Stolen Purse _ and Memories _ Returned After Nearly Two Decades</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The money was gone, but the workers figured <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> would still like to have back the purse they found behind an old department store cabinet. They were right. Found nearly two decades after it was stolen, it was like her own personal time capsule. There were pictures, an address book, old telephone numbers, memories. The construction workers who found it _ <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> _ eventually found Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, using the phone numbers. To ensure that they would recognize her, they studied her photograph. `` They were surprised ... they said you sure look different,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, whose permed dark hair has replaced the large Afro she once wore. `` They said I looked much better.'' `` It was my favorite purse at the time because it was given to me for my birthday,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, now 39, said Tuesday. `` Never in a million years did I think I would get that purse back.'' Inside was her learner's permit for driving. There were photos of her high school sweetheart, her girlfriends from high school. There was her then-new Social Security card. And her then-new voter registration card, along with gold-colored lipstick and makeup. There was a photo of her mother smoking a cigarette. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> happily said her mom has since given up the habit. Then there was a photo of herself as a much younger woman, wearing red bellbottom pants, a halter top and platform shoes. In another she wore a mini dress. `` It brought back memories,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Forestville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who now works as a congressional liaison for the Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. When she found the photo of her cousin <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, she said a wave of combined sadness and joy came over her. `` So many young people were killed'' in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, she said. `` I was so glad that he made it back.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said she and her sorority sisters, some of whom are pictured in another photo, will have a 20-year reunion Sept. 23. `` It's Gamma Theta Rho ... or is it Beta Rho?'' she questioned. `` It's been a long time.'' A thief had apparently stolen her purse from a locker 19 years ago when she worked as a secretary at the <LOCATION> Lansburgh </LOCATION>'s department store. The abandoned building is being torn down. The thief took $ 60 _ her weekly pay _ she said, and apparently tossed the purse atop the tall, wooden cabinet in the basement of the store. And there it stayed, through the years, until the workers moved that cabinet. `` It's like a dream come true, a fantasy -LRB- to have -RRB- people you do n't even know to bring back good memories,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` It goes to show that we do have some good samaritans.''

 Q. I'd like to follow up _ Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, if I could follow up, there are reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not want to pressure <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to back off because we need their help to get the hostages out? A. That's wrong. I never heard such a report, but if there is such a report you've heard, it is wrong Yeah. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, in the interview last week, I believe with <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, you seemed to say that you would be willing to kidnap General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to bring him to justice. Is that your policy and would that be an appropriate thing for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government to do? A. We have an indictment out against General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for drug trafficking. I am told that it's a good indictment, that it's an in-depth indictment, and I'm not saying what I would do or would n't do. But there was a case where a man named <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON>, I believe _ <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was apprehended and brought to justice. And I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice. Q. Well, are there any constraints on what means you use, even though there's a legal indictment, or are there limits on what would be appropriate in enforcing such an indictment? A. There's always limits _ there's always limits in matters of this nature. And the limits, as far as I'm concerned, are the lives of, first of Americans, and clearly, innocent life. You've got to consider those things when you go about whatever it is _ hostages, or the _ trying to bring Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice. Q. Mr. President _ Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, there was some talk of sending the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berets </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, do you think _ A. What was that question? Q. Sending the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berets </ORGANIZATION> _ A. Yeah. Q. _ There has been some talk of sending Green Berets to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Do you think that the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is enough to do this job, or not? And why? A. To do the job of _ of helping at the source? Well, you have to look at it country-by-country, and then I could tell you a little more about what the problem is. Some of the countries are faced with enormously well-organized and financed insurgencies. Some of them are faced with the most highly financed cartels. And so you'd have to look individually. And there's _ <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is n't big enough or strong enough to solve the problems in these various <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries; they can help a lot, and in some areas they have been very, very helpful. But I do n't think that the DEA alone can solve the problems of the cartels in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, for example. Q. Are you considering sending the Green Berets to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? A. No. No, I'm not considering that. Q. Mr. President _ -LRB- <LOCATION> Marlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fitzwater </LOCATION> -RRB-: Final question _ Q. On the drug plan _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: This is the final question, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> says _ Q. -LRB- Inaudible -RRB-. A. Pre-vacation question. Q. Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has indicated that part of the drug plan is to hold casual users of drugs accountable. Given that many, many state prisons are overflowing and, indeed, the federal system has no more room at the present time, what type of accountability are you looking for? Would it be jail time, or something short of that? A. Well, it depends what the _ you know, what the penalty is for the crime involved. And the tolerance, though, of casual users, or the excusing of one echelon of society for using drugs and then going after another is unacceptable in a national strategy. And so, I'd say we'd have to look at the individual _ individual case. But I think the day of tolerance for those who break the law in using drugs is over, and should be over. And so, we will try to make the punishment fit the crime, if you will.

That's what I suggest on <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> _ Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, are you a little concerned about raising expectations on drugs? A. No, I'm not because I think the time has come to encourage every element in our society, the teacher, the family, the local community, the state, the federal government to pitch in. So, I am not. I think it is time that we recognize there is a major national program _ problem, there are signs that some things can happen through education, and I cite the decline in cocaine use. And I think given that ray of hope, we ought to put on a full-court press, not just in the federal government, but all across society to try to solve this problem. Q. But is n't your reputation largely on the line given the promise you made at the inaugural? A. Far more important than my reputation is can we solve this problem, can we make progress against this scourge? And so be it, that's the way it is.

<TEXT>
 When the moon moves into the Earth's shadow Wednesday night, creating a total eclipse visible to perhaps a billion people, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> will fire a laser beam at a breadbox-sized reflector on the lunar surface a quarter of a million miles away. If the astronomer is successful, tiny particles of light will jump back across the vast distance and be captured by telescopes at the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. If he's not successful, <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> says he'll still enjoy the lunar eclipse _ a rare opportunity to watch the full moon change from a bright silver to a polished copper or faint orange, or, perhaps, even vanish from view. People on the continents bordering the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> will have a chance to see some phase of the lunar eclipse. It will start at 8:23 p.m. EDT and end about 5 -LCB- hours later. It will be the first full lunar eclipse since December 1982, and the next one will not occur until December 1992. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> will have the best viewing, if skies are clear, while <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will miss it altogether. In the central, mountain and western time zones, the eclipse will be under way already by the time the moon becomes visible. Moonrise in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for instance, is at 7:43 p.m. CDT, twenty minutes after the eclipse begins. And in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> rises at 7:35 p.m. PDT, when the eclipse is already in totality. Cloudy skies could spoil the celestial show for much of the East. Wednesday forecasts call for thundershowers. Observers may have better luck in the central and western areas of the country where clear to partly cloudy skies are predicted for most areas. With good local weather, some phase of the spectacle should be visible to observers in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. Sailors at sea in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and in the eastern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> also will be able to see part of the eclipse. A lunar eclipse occurs when the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> passes through the shadow created by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its orbit of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, usually passes above or below this shadowline. For <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, the total eclipse is precious opportunity to fire laser beams at a darkened full moon. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> astronomer will be firing the laser at a reflector placed near a lunar feature called <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rille </PERSON> in 1971 by the Apollo 15 astronauts. `` Anytime the moon sites are available, we fire the laser,'' he said in a telephone interview. But <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said it is impossible to see the laser reflection from a full moon because the natural surface reflects sunlight so powerfully. Only during an eclipse, he said, can McDonald scientists detect light reflecting from the Apollo instruments. By clocking the time it takes for light to travel from the laser to the moon and then back to the McDonald telescopes, scientists are able to precisely measure the distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and its moon. <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said in the years since astronomers have been laser ranging to the Apollo reflectors, they have discovered that the moon is moving away from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> at the rate of about two inches a year. The mean distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and moon is about 230,000 miles. But even without the laser experiment, <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said the astronomers are eagerly awaiting the eclipse. `` We're looking forward to the show,'' he said. During an eclipse, the moon can appear to be a bright coppery red if there is clean air between the lunar surface and the observer on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon can dim to an faint orange color or even fade from view altogether. Dust from volcanic eruptions can contribute to the color, but astronomers say that enough time has passed since the last major volcanic eruption that most dust has settled. The eclipse starts when the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> enters what is called the penumbra, the outer fringe of the Earth's shadow. This phase shows as a grayish shading of the moon. Half an hour later, the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> edges into the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow. Total eclipse, when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will begin at about 10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes. When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverse order. The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> edges out of the shadow altogether and regains its customary bright silver color.

 Growing understanding about AIDS is building Americans' confidence in the safety of the nation's blood supply, but many still believe it is likely they could get the disease by receiving or donating blood, said a poll released Tuesday. The poll conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> found that 66 percent think the blood supply is safer today than five years ago, up from 56 percent last year and 44 percent in 1985 when screening for AIDS in blood donations began. The survey shows `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public understands the steps being taken to protect the blood supply,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, president of the association. He said, however, gaps remain in the public's understanding. More than half of those surveyed, 52 percent, said they believe it is unlikely they could get AIDS from a blood transfusion. However, 44 percent considered it likely. In fact, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said, the chances of getting AIDS from a transfusion are extremely low. Since 1985, public health officials estimate that about 60 people have been infected with the virus through transfusions, a tiny fraction of the 4 million to 5 million transfusions performed each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We're not happy with 60,'' but that is far lower than the 30,000 that are believed to have been infected before procedures were initiated to screen out AIDS-contaminated blood, said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, executive director of the association. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public wants zero risk ... but zero risk is unattainable,'' as with any medical procedure, he said. Blood banks receive about 12 million blood donations a year. Three-quarters of those polled said it was unlikely someone could get AIDS from donating blood, but 20 percent erroneously believed it was likely. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> noted that the proportion of the public believing AIDS could be transmitted while giving blood has dropped from 34 percent in 1985, but he said this faulty belief has made if more difficult to recruit blood donors. Overall, the nation's blood supply is `` marginal'' and the amount of blood in the system has been unchanged for the last several years. He said that donating takes more time today than it did before 1985 because blood banks require more detailed questioning of donors as part of the AIDS-screening efforts. Blood that is donated is also subjected to an antibody test to detect presence of the AIDS virus. For the second year in a row, the survey found that AIDS was ranked as the most serious health problem facing the country, ahead of cancer, heart disease and drug abuse. However, fewer _ 31 percent this year compared with 36 percent last year _ gave it top ranking. Black Americans were the only group that showed increasing concern about AIDS, with 48 percent ranking it as the top health problem, up from 42 percent last year. Among the other findings: _ Contracting AIDS through a transfusion and difficulties during recurperation shared second place, each cited by 17 percent, as the greatest concerns in the case of an operation The top concern, 27 percent, was complications due to errors made by doctors and medical staff. Sixteen percent cited complications from anesthesia. _ 41 percent said they feel they have `` a lot'' of accurate information about AIDS, up 4 points from last year and 20 points since 1985 _ 16 percent of those polled said they personally knew someone infected with the AIDS virus, but 82 said they did not _ 91 percent said favored criminal penalties for people who donate blood even when they know they are infected with the AIDS virus _ 82 percent would require mandatory reporting to health officials the names of people who test positive for AIDS, and 81 percent would require mandatory testing of high-risk groups, such as drug users, homosexuals and prostitutes The telephone poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Staff of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, surveyed 1,000 randomly selected adults between June 23 and July 6. The sampling error for the survey is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

 The 6-month-old trial of `` Night Stalker'' murder defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> took another bizarre twist when a juror deliberating the case was slain in an apparent domestic dispute. The body of <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, a 30-year-old telephone employee, was found Monday afternoon in her home. Neighbors reported hearing fighting and gunshots in her apartment Friday night and early Saturday. Authorities were seeking her live-in boyfriend, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, 51, for questioning, said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehner </PERSON>. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON>, who dismissed a juror last week for sleeping during deliberations at <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s trial on 13 murder charges, replaced Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> with an alternate today and sent the panel home for the day. The judge warned that the slaying apparently `` had nothing to do with this case'' and `` does not add or diminish to the evidence of whether Mr. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is guilty or innocent.'' Both the defense and prosecution expressed a desire to avoid a mistrial. But defense attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he wants jurors to be polled on whether they feel they are able to go forward. The jury returns Wednesday. Prosecutors allege <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a 29-year-old drifter from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is the devil-worshiping `` Night Stalker'' who raped, robbed and murdered people in their <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> homes in 1985.

Monday was to have been the first day of the new deliberations, but Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> did n't show.

<TEXT>
 Advocates for improved pre-natal health care said Tuesday that spending $ 400 for expectant mother services can save a thousand times that amount in lifetime care costs for a low birthweight infant. Pointing out that the infant mortality rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the worst of any of the 18 industrialized nations, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to Prevent Infant Mortality called for `` universal access'' to early maternity and pediatric care for all mothers and infants. In a report issued this month, the commission said employers should make sure the health insurance they offer covers maternity and well-baby care, and called on the government to assume the responsibility for those who do n't have insurance. `` We can spend the money now or we can spend a lot more later,'' said the report. `` The costs of prenatal care _ care that can prevent low birthweight _ can be as little as $ 400 per mother. `` The lifetime costs of caring for a low birthweight infant can reach $ 400,000.'' Low birthweight is the leading cause of infant deaths and chronic and disabling illness, the commission said. <PERSON> Low </PERSON> birthweight babies are those born at less than five and a half pounds. `` This is very serious business,'' Dr. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON>, commissioner of health for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. He said the infant mortality rate for blacks is twice that for whites and named the crack cocaine problem as the reason for a recent increase in infant deaths in the district. He and other panelists appeared for an infant mortality symposium sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> at the Capitol. The group acknowledged that a tight federal budget meant little money for pre-natal care programs, and <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON> pointed out that much of the funding for public health concerns was now going to find a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. But the panel said publicity could do a lot to get expectant mothers to available health care facilities.

<TEXT>
 With the collapse of complete communist control of parliament, the once docile <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has emerged as an independent political force whose leaders seem determined to play a major role. Prime Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said Monday he is ready to give up trying to form a government in favor of <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>, who has favored continuing his party's historical alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, would be asked to create a Cabinet composed of representatives of all forces in parliament, according to <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. But the 54-year-old economist, who has led the party since 1981 and was among top communist coalition candidates who were defeated in June parliamentary elections, faces opposition from Peasant lawmakers in parliament who fear reprisals at the polls if the party's links with the unpopular communists are not cut. Led by <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentkowski </PERSON>, their independent-minded parliamentary floor leader, at least one third of the 76 Peasant deputies favor forming a coalition government with Solidarity. As the third-largest group in parliament, in which neither the larger communists or Solidarity lawmakers holds a majority, the Peasants suddenly have been catapulted into the role of kingmaker. The split between the party leadership and its representatives in parliament comes as the Peasants search for a new identity in response to voter disenchantment with the old party model and with an eye to completely free elections promised in the future. The peasant movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has deep roots, with the first organized Polish Peasant Party founded in <LOCATION> Rzeszow </LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION> Austria-ruled </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION>, in 1895. <LOCATION> Rzeszow </LOCATION>, now in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, remains a center of rural activism. Before and after World War II, the party advocated land reform to free the peasantry from the control of large wealthy landowners. In pre-war <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, it was an important political force, with its leader <PERSON> Wincenty </PERSON> <PERSON> Witos </PERSON> serving as premier three times. One of its leaders, <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikolajczyk </PERSON>, also headed the Polish government-in-exile in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> during World War II. The Polish <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> enjoyed a brief period of independent activity in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after World War II. But the communist party that swept to power as a result of Soviet military might forced the merger of the independent party, known as the <ORGANIZATION> PSL </ORGANIZATION>, with a pro-communist <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the SL, in 1949 to form the ZSL _ as the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is now known. In that era of Stalinist purges, independent Peasant leaders were forced to flee the country, step down or bend to communist rule. In the most notorious case, <PERSON> Mikolajczyk </PERSON>, the wartime premier and only member of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> government to risk coming back to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after the war to join a communist-led coalition, fled in 1947 when it became clear he was facing arrest and a show trial. He was denounced as a spy and lost his citizenship in 1949. Only this year was his citizenship restored posthumously by the Council of State. For most of the history of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ like the other minor party, the Democrats _ has obediently followed communist policy. In the last decade, as a result of political reforms, the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been allowed to develop a more independent policy while still acknowledging the communist party's `` leading role.'' It traditionally has exercised broad powers in rural areas and often holds the ministry of agriculture. The ZSL claims a membership of 500,000 and says it represents the interests of farmers. Peasant deputies resenting communist domination of the policies of their own party were critical of <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>'s defense of continued obedience to the communists at a caucus last week. Deputies favoring a coalition with Solidarity also have said their constituents resented <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s election as prime minister because it left the impression that nothing has changed, despite Solidarity's victory at the polls in June. The internal revolt within the ZSL took on a new dimension Tuesday, as 120 peasant activists from around the country met in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and decided to resume the activities of <PERSON> Mikolajczyk </PERSON>'s old <ORGANIZATION> PSL </ORGANIZATION>, which was declared illegal in 1947, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Participants, who included representatives from <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION>, the independent farmers' union, said the party would be revived on the basis of the program adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> PSL </ORGANIZATION> in 1946.

 Thousands of people cheered, and 15 quietly protested, as Marines stormed a city-owned beach on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> on Tuesday in a recruitment drive. `` Just to see the vast majority of people here getting up early and watching us makes me proud of the service I do in the Marine Corps,'' said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` I feel it's my job to protect the people I see here,'' said <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, dressed in full combat gear and with his face blackened with camouflage. Police Capt. <PERSON> Cel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> estimated that 10,000 people turned out at <LOCATION> Lakeview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to watch a company of about 100 <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> board four landing craft from the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> and land on the beach in a morning mist. Fifteen people staged a silent protest at a gazebo overlooking the beach, holding anti-war placards and distributing literature. `` This whole thing is so silly, the idea that you can make a war a carnival,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a co-pastor at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oberlin </LOCATION>. The protesters represented various groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Lorain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, Clergy and Laity Concerned and the Baptist Peace Fellowship. But most of the crowd cheered the Marines and scampered across the beach to inspect the landing craft. `` I liked it,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Westlake </PERSON>, who was holding his 1-year-old son, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he wanted to see `` where your tax dollar goes.''

 F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> became acting president Tuesday and pledged faster action on limited racial policy reforms begun by his predecessor, P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but did not say what he would do. `` There is no doubt that we stand on the threshold of a new era in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. History offers us a unique opportunity for peaceful solutions,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said at the brief swearing-in ceremony in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a leading critic of the government, said: `` All he is doing is giving a new face to apartheid.'' The transition is `` just a change of initials from P.W. to F.W,'' said the black <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leader, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his work against apartheid. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it hoped for an `` active dialogue'' with the new leadership on ending apartheid, the official policy of racial discrimination. It held out the possibility of a visit by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who also heads the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who led <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 11 often turbulent years, resigned Monday night after repeated confrontations with his Cabinet. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders tried to persuade the 73-year-old president to leave gracefully after he suffered a stroke Jan. 18, but <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> refused. His stubborn, defiant manner resulted in embarrassing public battles likely to hurt the party in parliamentary elections Sept. 6. There was no evidence of policy disputes with the Cabinet, but younger leaders appeared to believe <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s age, health and growing political isolation made him unable to continue the gradual, limited reforms he introduced in the early 1980s. After nationwide black unrest developed in 1984, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> increasingly turned away from reform and relied on repression to stifle black political demands. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Tuesday for starting reform. `` His greatest gift to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the fact that he has put our country on the road to fundamental reform, that he has successfully started pulling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> out of its dead-end streets,'' he told reporters after being sworn in by Chief Justice <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>. He repeated his intention to speed reform, but did not pledge specific action on such major apartheid issues as sharing power with blacks, who outnumber whites 28 million to 5 million and have no voice in national affairs. `` We want to build a new <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in which all people participate in decisions affecting their lives at all levels,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. `` I trust that the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will show the courage and vision required to break the cycle of conflict, tension and isolation that has gripped us for so long.'' Since taking over from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in February as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed since 1948, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has stressed the need for immediate reform to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s deep racial divisions and international isolation. His speeches are more conciliatory than <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s, his personal style affable rather than confrontational. At age 53, he belongs to a younger generation more receptive to change. Through 17 years in politics, however, he has been a loyal supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ including limited race reforms that reject majority rule. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has not set himself apart from any <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> policies and has yet to name apartheid laws he would repeal. The African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla movement fighting white supremacy, said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` dedicated his life to the construction of the apartheid system and its defense at all costs.'' `` He has brought death and destruction to millions of people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the rest of the region ... through a systematic campaign of brutal repression,'' general secretary <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nzo </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, where the group has its headquarters. South African media also had harsh words about the former president. `` The last image that will linger for many years is that of a blind <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> who with his last strength tried to overturn the pillars of his party on himself and his own companions,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION>, an Afrikaans-language daily that had supported <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is favored in next month's elections, it is expected to lose ground to both the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on its left and the segregationist <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on its right. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said he will convene a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a week after the election. If the Nationalists win, he is expected to become president for a full five-year term.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he could not claim American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were any closer to freedom despite an intense diplomatic effort but that there was `` a good likelihood'' they could come home if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wanted them released. Renewing his appeal for assistance from the new leaders in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We do n't have to be hostile with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the rest of our lives. We've had a good relationship with them in the past'' before breaking off relations a decade ago. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, accused by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of sponsoring terrorism, is the major bankroller of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the radical group thought to be an umbrella for various factions of the hostage-holders. `` I think that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wanted those hostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen _ perhaps not with certainty but a good likelihood,'' the president said. He said that there were limits on possible military action to free the hostages, that he did not want to see innocent people killed and would have to weigh the risks to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces that would be involved. `` But if I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and bring them out, and that required using the military force of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, make no mistake about it _ I would do it in an instant,'' the president said. `` At some point we have to stand up for our interests, even if it means military, yet I'm not threatening military action,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed the hostage situation in a half-hour news conference on the eve of his departure for a three-week vacation at his seaside compound at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He promised that one day after his Labor Day return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he would unveil a new anti-drug program that is `` balanced, decisive, effective and achievable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the program would require more federal spending but not higher taxes, adding that the money would be diverted from other programs. While the hostage crisis and, to a lesser extent, drugs, dominated the news conference, he commented on other subjects ranging including economic policy and Panamanian leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The president: _ Refused to rule out the possibility of abducting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to stand trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. `` I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. _ Pronounced himself `` very comfortable'' with budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s comment that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was keeping interest rates too high to permit sustained growth. However, when asked if he agreed with <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would be responsible for any recession if interest rates do n't drop, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped, saying `` I do n't recall that part of it and -LRB- I'll -RRB- take that under advisement and let you know at a later date.'' _ Said he wished the legal process could proceed `` without a lot of hype'' in the case of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official suspected of espionage. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has not been charged. _ Eulogized Reps. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss., who died in separate plane crashes He said they were `` fine individuals -LRB- who -RRB- represented a deep caring for the poor, the disadvantaged, the victims of drug abuse and crime and many other areas of our society that need improving.'' The plight of the eight Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was pushed to the fore after Israeli commandos seized a Moslem cleric in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, on July 28. In response, a group called the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> contended it had hanged <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Asked if the American hostages were any closer to freedom now as a result of the developments of the past few weeks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't say that today, but we're going to keep on trying.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that with <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> assuming the presidency of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` we hear different signals coming out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ some in the old monde and then some that offer more hope. He said the release of the hostages would send `` a clear and good signal'' of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intentions, adding that `` there are many ways that countries who are estranged can get back together, from diplomatic relations or a wide array of other things.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might seek the extradition of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, who has been said to have been instrumental in <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` we have no indictment'' against <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` If the justice system goes forward and there is an indictment against him, I would be remiss if I did n't try to see him brought to trial.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed caught off guard momentarily when a questioner asked why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not retaliated for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death. `` If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, private sector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostages out or guard against future hostage taking, I would take such action,'' he said.

The group, ranging from elderly women to four babies, is scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Thursday in the biggest such repatriation of boat people since the first group left in March. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeuwen </PERSON> based his statements on a preliminary report by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials about camps housing 6,700 of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 51,000 boat people. Large numbers of children in a camp at <LOCATION> Tai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> A </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the ferries were suffering from `` borderline malnutrition,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeuwen </PERSON> said, although he not say how many. `` When you have a population which has become weakened through below-standard levels of nutrition they become very vulnerable to an outbreak of disease which could have life threatening consequences,'' he said. `` They can not be expected to continue much longer with the diet provided.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeuwen </PERSON>'s statement is one of several recent criticisms made recently by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s handling of the boat people. Last week, another <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said the camps were some of the worst he had seen. `` The space is less than the space given to people in prison here,'' said <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhet </PERSON>, head of the technical support unit for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` It is even less than what is supposed to be given here for a dog.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization has alleged that more than 100 boat people were beaten by police during a July 23 disturbance at a detention center in the New Territories section of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Opposition to the refugees is growing in this crowded colony of 5 million people. Residents of one village have organized protests and sit-ins against a planned camp near the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> reservoir in the New Territories. The opposition was evident Tuesday when reporters were brought to the Lo Wu detention center near the Chinese border to speak with some of the voluntary returnees. Posters reading, `` Say no to <PERSON> Viets </PERSON>,'' and `` No more Viets,'' lined the entrance to the camp. Inside the camp, a former army post, children and women in ragged clothing looked out through barbed-wire fences. Vietnamese men in T-shirts smiled and asked for cigarettes. `` Those people who still have hope will stay,'' said <PERSON> Truang </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Bong </PERSON>, a 21-year-old fisherman from <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION>. `` I have no more hope so I'm going back. I think my government wo n't punish me. I believe the assurances of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised it wo n't prosecute its returning citizens. Other refugees said they were returning because they missed their families. `` I miss my old mother very much,'' said <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON>, 39, a fishmonger from <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION>. She said her brother was unable to care for her mother because he is in jail for trying to flee <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` We all have to take risks,'' she said about returning. `` But for me the pull of my family is too strong.'' The group of 124 will be the third to leave <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since the voluntary repatriation program began in March. So far, groups of 75 and 68 boat people have returned home. Adult returnees are given $ 50 and children 14 and under are given $ 25. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> will also assist them once they return to their homes with a food allowance. They are among the 38,300 Vietnamese who have sailed into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since the British colony adopted a tough policy last year ruling out resettlement for most of them. Under the new policy, Vietnamese are considered refugees only if they can prove they fled their homeland beccause of persecution.

 A Chinese passenger plane faltered during takeoff Tuesday and plunged into a river near the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> airport, killing 18 people, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Television news said the Antonov-24, a twin-turboprop of Soviet design, carried 32 passengers and eight crew members. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said rescuers were trying to extricate survivors from the wreckage near <LOCATION> Hongqiao </LOCATION> airport, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. It was the first Chinese air accident since August 1988, when a flight from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> crashed while landing at <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, killing seven people.

<TEXT>
 A 30-year-old crack dealer with no prior police record has been sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole on his first conviction. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> `` Polo'' <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> `` had a decision to make, and that was whether to deal in crack or not,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` And he chose to deal in crack. He got exactly what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted for that decision.'' At Monday's sentencing hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> was unswayed by <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s pleas for mercy. `` It seems to me your activity was the type you could stop at any time,'' <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said. `` You were the wheel on which this whole operation spun.'' But defense attorney <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> argued for mercy. `` I've represented people who took lives and received less of a sentence,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. `` It's a tragedy. I'm not saying this as an attorney, I'm saying this as a human being: Everybody has worth and dignity. Everybody should have a chance at rehabilitation.'' <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, convicted June 1, made as much as $ 25,000 a week, one witness estimated. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> ferried cocaine from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION>, cooked the powder into crack rocks in a microwave oven, then kept the street dealers supplied, witnesses said. Prosecutors argued that <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s case met federal guidelines for a life sentence. Besides heading the drug ring, the case involved more than one kilogram of crack, a firearm was found, and <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> tried to bribe a witness not to testify by offering $ 10,000 or a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>. He also refused to reveal the source of his cocaine. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> implored the judge for a second chance. `` I can remember J.F. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> saying every man and woman makes a difference. In order to make a difference, you have to be given a chance,'' he told the judge. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> said he'd already begun rehabilitation while in federal custody for the past 14 months. `` My intention is to set up a drug foundation to help somebody with a drug problem,'' <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> said. `` I know drugs are a terrible problem, destroying our nation.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying `` I'm not holding my breath'' waiting for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step aside, Tuesday hinted that abduction of the Panamanian leader might be justifiable. `` I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference. He cited the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 abduction of a Lebanese highjacker as precedent for such long-arm tactics. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains under 1988 indictments on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug-conspiracy charges. While declining to say whether abducting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was actually being considered, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We have an indictment out against Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for drug trafficking. I'm told that it's a good indictment, that it's an in-depth indictment.'' Expanding on remarks he made in an interview last week with reporters from <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the nationally broadcast news conference: `` I'm not saying what I would do or would n't do, but there was a case where a man named <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was apprehended and brought to justice.'' It was a reference to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> hostage rescue squad's grabbing on Sept. 13, 1987, of Lebanese hijacker <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents lured <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> aboard a yacht 13 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> with the prospect of a drug deal and a party. He was later convicted in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of leading five heavily armed men in hijacking <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 402 and holding 70 passengers and crew hostage for 30 hours in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed the longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that normal relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not resume so long as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in power. However, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose regime annulled a May 7 presidential election that international observers said was won by opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, has shown no signs of yielding to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that he step down. A team of international mediators is in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> now negotiating terms of a resolution by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- OAS -RRB- calling for new elections on Sept. 1. `` Part of our understanding on the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> agreement was that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be out,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But, he added: `` I'm not holding my breath on his voluntary departure.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told reporters that he had recently told opposition candidate <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> that `` We will continue to support what the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> voted for.'' A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vow of support for <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> did not put the administration at odds with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> agreement to promote new elections Sept. 1, conditioned on a transfer of power from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime to a transitional government The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports that plan, said the official, although it continues to believe that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> fairly won the election. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s defense forces and de facto leader, said last week that he was not going to step down, despite the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> agreement. He has been in power for six years. Last Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters from <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> that `` I would n't rule out any option'' when asked if he would consider seizing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to bring him to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to some published accounts, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> considered a plan to abduct <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> while he was visiting his daughter in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, but rejected it as too risky.

 The sun did n't shine into <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>'s room. The single window of the room where police believe <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> mutilated the body of 5-year-old <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomoto </PERSON> was blocked by piles of comic books, pornography and children's cartoon videotapes. Police announced Tuesday that the 26-year-old print shop worker had confessed to killing and mutilating three girls in what television news is calling the worst murder case in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar history. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> was arrested Friday in connection with the killing of <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> in June. Police said <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> also confessed to strangling <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Konno </PERSON>, 4, in August 1988, burning the body and leaving it on her parents' doorstep; and strangling <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Namba </PERSON>, also 4, in December and dumping her body on a mountain Television and newspaper coverage, including images of the suspect's room, has stirred fear in the homes of Japanese unfamiliar with the level of violent crime in many other societies. The child slayings are the latest in a series of murders of startling brutality by Japanese youth. Experts have been filling the airwaves with analyses of the impact of violent sex imagery that is perhaps more pervasive in Japanese popular culture than in any other developed country. Japanese barely blink at the graphic scenes of rape and murder they see in sports newspapers and comic books. They usually ignore the ads plastering telephone booths for prostitution services. Now, the extraordinary attention given the <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> case, which has dominated the front pages of national newspapers for days, has stunned the Japanese and stirred concern about sex and violence in the media. Police told local newspapers that the videos <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> collected ranged from cartoons to child pornography and violent movies. Authorities say <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> confessed that in early June, he kidnapped the 5-year-old near her suburban apartment, killed her, mutilated her body and dumped it in a cemetery. Members of <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>'s video club told newspapers he was an obsessive collector of cartoon tapes. His main hobbies, news reports say, were copying tapes and doing pornographic photography. His parents simply described him as shy. `` He was always so quiet that we wanted him to hurry up and get married so we could stop worrying about him,'' they told the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Some experts blame violent videos for contributing to his mental state and that of other people like him. `` If such videos were not so widely available, crimes like this might not have happened,'' said <PERSON> Susumu </PERSON> <PERSON> Oda </PERSON>, professor of mental health at <ORGANIZATION> Tsukuba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` For people with this kind of disposition, videos can help put plans in their heads.'' Another reportedly obsessive video hobbyist, <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kataoka </PERSON>, 21, was arrested Monday on suspicion of videotaping and sexually abusing more than 30 girls. <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hida </PERSON>, a 22-year-old mechanic who reportedly spent most of his free time playing video games with neighborhood children, was arrested earlier this year on suspicion of strangling one of them. Gang violence also is worrying many Japanese. In June, a young man received the death sentence _ a rarity for a minor _ for his role in slaying a young couple out for a drive. A group of teen-agers beat the couple with iron rods, raped the woman, and killed both of them.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of East Germans who want to flee to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> moved their vigil Tuesday from the closed West German Consulate to a nearby church, while German and Hungarian officials negotiated their fate. These and other East Germans, who demand permission to emigrate via West German diplomatic facilities in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, have created a standoff involving their communist homeland, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. West German diplomats closed their <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> consulate and embassy Monday because they said they could not handle the crush of East Germans demanding asylum. <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuchlik </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> foreign section, said Tuesday about 200 East Germans had come from the consulate to the courtyard of a Roman Catholic church about two miles away. An East German outside the church grounds said later the number had risen to about 300. About 30 East Germans remained in front of the consulate. They said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> diplomats had given them money. `` I'm staying here as long as it takes,'' said a 47-year-old man from the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> area who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` One month, two months, I do n't care.'' Varying numbers of East Germans have been maintaining a vigil in front of the embassy and consulate for at least a week. They had been allowed inside at night until the buildings closed Monday. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hanns </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said Monday that 141 other adults and 40 children were holed up inside the embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. Political opposition figures estimate that 400 East Germans have overstayed their visas and gone underground. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> closed its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission Aug. 8 after 131 East Germans seeking guarantees that they can go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sought refuge there. Negotiations involving both German states and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> continued Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. It gave no details. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> wrote a letter on the problems in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. He did not say what the letter said. Red Cross officials said they did n't know how long the East Germans at the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> church would continue their vigil. `` We have means of taking care of them for about two weeks, but we're considering longer-range plans,'' said <PERSON> Stuchlik </PERSON> Speaking by telephone, <PERSON> Stuchlik </PERSON> said tents may be erected in the courtyard by Wednesday. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maltesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a charity group, were providing three meals a day for the East Germans. Hungarian authorities were not consulted about the move to the church, he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> could turn to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> if it ran out of money and food for the East Germans. An East German consulate statement carried by the Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> urged all East Germans staying here illegally to return home. It also repeated a pledge that they would not be prosecuted for escape attempts or overstaying visas. East Germans began asking for asylum in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> last month after failed attempts to escape across the Austrian border, where liberal Hungarian authorities have removed fences. The East Germans say they fear persecution at home because they tried to flee. At least 1,600 East Germans are estimated to have crossed illegally into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since the fences came down in May. Once in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, they try to obtain papers from the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. East Germans can easily visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but it is difficult for them to travel legally to the West. The East German who commented at the church said West German diplomats on church grounds were issuing West German passports to the East Germans. According to West German law, all East Germans have a right to West German passports. Consulate and embassy personnel routinely issued passports to all East Germans seeking them before the two compounds closed. However, Hungarian border authorities have not allowed bearers of West German passports made out in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to cross into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> on Tuesday expressed support for increasing tax benefits for individual savers, contending that expanded Individual Retirement Accounts would help boost the country's low savings rate and reduce <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge trade deficit <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> stressed that her endorsement did not mean that the administration had decided to propose such a change, which has the potential of benefiting millions of Americans. But other officials have said the administration is readying a fall campaign to address the chronically low <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate and that expanding tax benefits to individual investors who use IRAs was one of the ideas being considered. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said that expanding IRAs would `` highlight the great need for private savings to go up. It sends up a flag saying, this is very important, not only to your nation, but to your own future and to your children.'' One reason long advanced for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s high trade deficits is that Americans consume more than the country can produce domestically. If Americans could be persuaded to cut back on consumption and save more, then it would limit the need for foreign goods, economists reason. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rates would also lower the cost of capital for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses and make their products more competitive on overseas markets. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said she did not know anyone in the administration who opposed increasing <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> tax benefits but she said there was concern over such questions as the potential loss of federal revenue. The huge cost to the treasury of IRAs was one reason that they were greatly scaled back by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. As a result, the number of tax returns claiming <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deductions fell from 15.5 million in 1987 to 7.4 million last year. The administration is considering a variety of proposals to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rates as part of a fall initiative designed to address long-range problems facing the country. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is scheduled to kick off the campaign with a series of speeches, officials have said. The personal savings rate, savings as a percent of after-tax income fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and increased only slightly to 4.2 percent last year. By contrast, the savings rate in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was 16.5 percent in 1987. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said that increasing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate would help her answer charges from Japanese trade negotiators that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not done enough on its own to solve its huge trade deficit. Currently, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> is holding negotiations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in an effort to get those nations to lower trade barriers cited by the administration last May when it issued a `` hit list'' of the countries with the most harmful barriers to sales of American products. The Japanese have countered that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should make progress in boosting its savings rate and cutting its huge federal budget deficit as a way of lessening its dependence on foreign capital. The administration's various trade opening initiatives are aimed at lowering the country's huge trade deficit, which measured $ 126.5 billion last year on a current account basis covering trade in both merchandise and services. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the current account deficit over the next 18 months may actually rise `` a little,'' reflecting the rise in the value of the dollar, which makes American goods less competitive on overseas markets. `` It is hard to predict, but I do not look for a dramatic drop in the trade deficit,'' she said.

He is `` considered a probable case of herpes B virus,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> died in June from the virus after he was infected through a bite or scratch from a research monkey at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mattawan </LOCATION>, an independent contract lab. Another former <ORGANIZATION> IRDC </ORGANIZATION> employee is infected with the virus, which is present in more than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys, a type of Old World monkey commonly used in experiments. The virus is harmless to animals, but attacks the brain and central nervous system in humans and has an estimated 70 percent mortality rate once symptoms appear. IRDC corporate officials are out of town and <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s employment status could not be confirmed, company spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. On July 28, the public health department levied $ 30,600 in fines against <ORGANIZATION> IRDC </ORGANIZATION> for alleged violations of worker safety regulations and for failing to tell all employees who worked with the monkeys about the risks they faced. <ORGANIZATION> IRDC </ORGANIZATION> officials have denied the allegations and are appealing. The company, which employs about 350 people, uses thousands of animals, including monkeys dogs, rabbits and rats, to test drugs and chemicals for pharmaceutical, veterinary and agricultural companies.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Calls For Meeting to Solve Government Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> called Tuesday for an emergency meeting of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political leaders to seek `` rational solutions'' to a growing government crisis that he said threatens the nation's stability. The call was seconded by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who also said that `` if society wants it,'' he would agree to serve as prime minister. If Solidarity succeeds in winning the prime minister's post, it would be the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc since the late 1940s. Prime minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said Monday he is ready to resign and abandon efforts to assemble a Cabinet in the face of Solidarity's opposition to any communist-led government. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> became prime minister 12 days ago. He urged that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>, a communist loyalist, be selected by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to form a `` grand coalition'' government that would include communists and members of Solidarity. But the proposal of <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> drew little interest from other political groups, and <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> himself by late Tuesday had not answered whether he wants to be considered a candidate. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> reiterated his proposal to form a government based on a coalition of Solidarity, the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with some sensitive posts left to the communists. In the confused political situation, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> `` expresses his concern over the deepening instability of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political and economic situation.'' `` The president intends to appeal to representatives of the main political forces in the country for participation in a joint meeting devoted to seeking rational solutions ... as soon as possible,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> also asked for restraint in `` political and social emotions, which make national accord more difficult.'' He contacted <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> through private channels to ask him for a meeting, possibly on Wednesday, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Pusz </PERSON>. The joint meeting was likely to bring together representatives of the three parties and Solidarity, who were the main figures in last spring's successful talks that led to an accord on elections and legalizing the independent trade union movement after a seven-year ban. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he welcomed <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s decision to abandon forming a government but rejected <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> as prime minister. He said the parties in the coalition discussions should decide on a candidate. `` If society wants it, I will have to go for the prime minister's office,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said `` But I would prefer someone else.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also told state TV: `` After we sit down and reach agreement on deep reforms, then we will find the names -LRB- to head the government -RRB- too.'' He said any Solidarity-led government would guarantee the sensitive ministries of defense and interior to the communist party and would do nothing to endanger `` the functioning of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact'' military alliance. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said a Solidarity coalition would be `` a government of national responsibility, nominated with respect for the rights of the Polish president'' _ referring to the constitutional rights of <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to control foreign policy and the armed forces. Despite such assurances, the prospect of a Solidarity-led government has alarmed the communist party and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has said it could destabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The party may also fear a Solidarity government would purge the `` nomenklatura'' _ party loyalists who hold tens of thousands of government and management posts _ and undermine the communist party's main base of support. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which along with the Peasants holds the parliamentary balance of power, on Tuesday endorsed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s bid to form the next government. `` We think that we should do everything to realize <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s proposal, which has broad support,'' said the secretariat of the party, which historically has been allied to the communists <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Aug. 7 that only a government headed by Solidarity and dominated by non-communists will have the credibility to solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political and economic problems On the economic front, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s caretaker <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> said extra food supplies are to be directed to larger cities, and publicly owned shops are to be sold or rented to private food vendors. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s decision to resign, saying it reflected a `` feeling of responsibility'' and could solve the government crisis. He said he had nothing personally against Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, the interior minister for eight years. The resignation of a communist premier because the opposition wo n't endorse him _ as well as the bid by Solidarity to form a government against the wishes of the Polish and Soviet party authorities _ demonstrates how radically <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc politics have changed. The events would have been unthinkable a year ago. Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, the country's Roman Catholic primate, noted the changes during an annual Assumption Day sermon in <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>. `` These events and changes of great significance were made finally without violence and destruction. ... And we should thank <PERSON> God </PERSON> for that,'' he said. But he warned the crowd of 150,000 of `` new concerns,'' including the economy. Solidarity began coalition talks Thursday with lamakers from the two minor parties, which have a combined strength of 103 seats and hold the balance of power in parliament. Normally obscure and once regarded as little more than communist fronts, the parties have been thrown into the role of kingmakers. <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentkowski </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament delegation, said he favors Solidarity's concept for the next government About a third of the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislators are leaning to Solidarity and want greater independence from the communists. <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> represents the more traditional, pro-communist wing of the party that claims 500,000 members. Since partially free elections in June, many of the minor-party lawmakers feel that in order to survive they must distance themselves from the generally unpopular communists.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Order Strike to Protest Gaza Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leaders of the anti-Israeli uprising Tuesday ordered <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to boycott their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a week to protest restrictive new measures imposed on Arabs in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The order for a seven-day strike, which would be the longest in the 20-month-old uprising, came along with a call for `` more stones and knives'' in fighting Israeli occupation. A Palestinian man died Tuesday of a gunshot wound suffered a day earlier in a clash with soldiers, the army said. The death brought to 536 the number of Palestinians killed by soldiers or Jewish settlers since the uprising began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis have been killed. Sixteen other Palestinans were reported shot and wounded Tuesday in confrontations with soldiers in the occupied lands, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. One of the victims, a 14-year-old girl from the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, was reported in critical condition with a bullet in the head. The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising said in a communique that the strike should begin Friday, the day the army begins enforcing a new rule that requires <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to show computerized ID cards to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Cards are denied anyone considered a security risk. More than 50,000 Gazans work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as do about 60,000 Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The uprising leaders called the cards `` a policy of starvation'' that would deny Arabs work and said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> who did not strike in sympathy for those in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would be considered `` betrayers.'' It also called for an escalation of the fight against Israeli occupation and ordered Palestinians not to meet with Israelis who do not support the goals of an independent Palestinian state. It said `` anybody who breaks this decision will be outside the national line.'' Israeli officials have held a series of meetings with Palestinian leaders to try to persuade them to accept the government's peace plan, which calls for elections in the occupied lands but rules out an independent Palestinian state. The 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories closed their shops and offices Tuesday in response to a strike call by the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> movement. Another commercial strike has been called Wednesday by the underground leadership. The Palestinian who died Tuesday was identified by an army spokeswoman as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayub </PERSON>, 23, of the Fara refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The spokeswoman said <PERSON> Ayub </PERSON> was shot in the back Monday when soldiers opened fire on youths who attacked an army patrol `` at close range with large stones and concrete blocks.'' Several thousand camp residents raised <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanted pro-PLO slogans at a funeral procession for <PERSON> Ayub </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. The army ordered a curfew on the camp after the funeral, confining the 5,000 residents to their homes.

<HEAD>Historians Say Secret Pact No Proof of Forced Annexation of Baltics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> made it clear Tuesday that its acknowledgement of a secret pact with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> dividing up <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states does not mean it was admitting the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> were forced to join the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The latest official view of history and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact came in a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> news conference with nine historians and a ministry spokesman. They said it was perfectly logical for the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> to invite the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> onto their territory after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The issue is at the heart of a drive by <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to gain more autonomy _ if not outright independence _ from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. For decades, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> denied the existence of the secret protocols to the non-aggression pact, which was signed by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> on Aug. 23, 1939, one week before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Microfilm copies in West German archives indicate the protocols allocated the majority of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s sphere of influence, and the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states and eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A commission set up by the Soviet parliament in June is expected to announce any day that it has determined the protocols were genuine. Members of the commission say the official report will condemn the protocols and declare them null and void. `` The secret protocols said the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> were in the sphere of influence of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' agreed historian <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semryaga </PERSON> at Tuesday's news conference. `` But what does that mean? It does not mean they were obliged to become part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` I was in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> in September 1939,'' said another historian, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berezhkov </PERSON>, referring to an area that had been part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and was incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> that month. `` The population was friendly.'' <PERSON> Berezhkov </PERSON> also said he thought it was logical for the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> to agree to the establishment of Soviet military bases on their soil after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The historians did show some signs of disagreement when asked if they were dismissing the testimony of Baltic witnesses to the events of 1939-40, who say their independent nations were forced to join the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by the occupying <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Historian <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chubarin </PERSON> said some members of his profession are reconsidering the standard view that the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> viewed their entrance to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` with euphoria.'' <PERSON> Chubarin </PERSON> said he personally believes there were various opinions among Baltic citizens at the time, and `` the choice was very narrow in 1940, after the fall of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' `` A lot of people saw the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a good partner,'' he said. `` They saw the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the embodiment of socialist principles'' but wound up with Stalinism instead of socialism. `` They suffered, as did many other peoples of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chubarin </PERSON> said. On orders from Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, tens of thousands of Baltic citizens were deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the Far North. But another member of the panel, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was moderate in its actions in the Baltic and even agreed to inform local authorities of impending military exercises. `` Occupying forces never behaved like that,'' <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> said. Several members of the panel blamed <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for the secret pact, and echoed the conclusion of the commission that the protocols were illegal because they never were approved by the nominal parliament of the time. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Filatov </PERSON>, editor of Military History Journal, argued the protocols `` were just prepared by clerks'' and never approved. But <PERSON> Chubarin </PERSON> did not let that pass. `` Those were not minor clerks who signed it,'' he said. The German copies of the pact and accompanying maps show the signatures of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> as well as Molotov and <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON>. One member of the parliamentary commission, Latvian I.Y. Kezbers, said in the newspaper Arguments and Facts this weekend that the pact showed <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s `` imperialist tendencies.''

<HEAD>President Appears Handcuffed in Effort to Rescue Hostages</HEAD>

 He shuffled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships around the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, sought the help of other nations and offered <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> his goodwill. But with it all, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared on Tuesday to be handcuffed in his struggle to free the American hostages. Two weeks of veiled threats interspersed with indirect offers to resume normal relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> have not produced tangible results. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, responding with evident discomfort to tough questions at a White House news conference, could neither report evidence of progress in his multi-layered campaign nor offer a promising new approach. `` We're going to keep on trying,'' was about all he could muster in the way of a response. `` There's a lot of lines out there, a lot of initiatives have been taken.'' And yet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was forced to acknowledge that efforts so far failed to permit him to provide a `` positive assessment at this point.'' His predicament is not unique. President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> tried a similar range of tactics, and a dramatic helicopter rescue operation that fell apart in a disabling windstorm in the Iranian desert. And yet he was unable to liberate the Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days. They emerged on his last day in office, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Inauguration Day in 1980 As for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, despite his muscular campaign rhetoric, only a surreptitious transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ which caused an uproar when it became public _ seemed to liberate three Americans. And others were seized subsequently. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, rounding out his seventh month in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, might take some comfort in his predecessors' frustrations. But he, too, has been unable to dent the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which abducted and apparently killed Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The factions believed to be holding eight other Americans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> present an elusive and perhaps impossible target. They are mingled in with innocent civilians in slums and camps, and apparently move the hostages around and about in a crazy-quilt pattern that defies American surveillance. `` If I could find some action _ diplomatic, military, private sector, public sector _ that I thought would help get the hostages out or guard against future hostage taking, I would take such action,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But on the military front, at least, the leader of the world's most powerful nation seems paralyzed `` I'd like to know that what action we took was not going to victimize a lot of innocent people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` When you look at the action that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can take, I do n't want to be responsible for the loss of innocent life.'' Besides, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must weigh the safety of the hostages themselves and the lives of the Americans sent on a long-shot rescue mission. On the diplomatic front, his appeal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the Arab world and other friendly or neutral countries has at least gained their sympathetic support. But as with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s public signal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last Wednesday that `` goodwill begets goodwill,'' there is no response from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that portends freeing of the hostages. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious leader issued a flat rejection Monday of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goodwill gestures and White House hints that direct talks could be in the offing `` Next to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the usurper regime ruling over occupied <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, you are the most cursed government in the eyes of the Iranian people,'' the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said in slamming that door shut. `` No one in the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> will hold talks with you.'' That leaves the legal front. Lawyers at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have been looking at anti-terrorist laws to see if a case can be built for extraditing <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, the Israeli-held Moslem cleric said by some to have played a role in <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction. Presumably, that might touch off a chain of events leading to a swap for the hostages, as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has proposed. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was very cool to the idea. If there is an indictment, he said, `` I would be remiss if I did n't try to see him brought to trial.'' Well, a reporter pressed, could the president take the lead and encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to proceed? `` I've put it just exactly the way I want to put it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said with a touch of irritation and frustration. On Wednesday, with the hostage crisis _ his first real foreign policy problem _ hanging over him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embarks on a 20-day vacation. Obviously, he would like to have a solution, or at least be on the verge of one. `` If I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and bring them out, and that required using the military force of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, make no mistake about it, I would do it in an instant,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> podium with every indication that is not about to happen.

<HEAD>Ignition Test on Shuttle Rocket Motor Called Successful</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Preliminary results show that an ignition test Tuesday of the space shuttle's redesigned solid rocket motor was a success, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said. The center is continuing to test the redesigned engine to check the performance of joints that were blamed for the 1986 Challenger explosion, even though the engine is currently used in flights. The lastest was by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, which returned Sunday from a space voyage. The tested rocket motor contained intentional flaws, including a lack of adhesive on one of the joints and a small hole in another. But the test worked as predicted with no leaks passing expected points, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Vibbart </PERSON>, project manager for the test. Further testing on the rocket motor will be done in the next few days to determine if any possible leaks occurred, officials said. The test was the initial one in the second phase of trials of the redesigned solid rocket motor. Officials expect to conduct several more years of testing, including some work on the next generation of rocket motors to be built at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> site in <LOCATION> Iuka </LOCATION>, Miss. `` We feel that we have tested the redesigned rocket motor sufficiently to demonstrate its flight readiness,'' <PERSON> Vibbart </PERSON> said after Tuesday's test. `` But we're also cautious technical engineers that feel we need to continue to gather data to make sure there are no surprises lurking out there.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> used his independence day speech Tuesday to attack Parliamentary opponents and accuse them of slowing the nation's progress. Also Tuesday, authorities blamed Pro-Pakistani extremists for a grenade that injuring 27 people in the city of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, a popular tourist resort in the northern <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. Moslem extremists there are waging a campaign to support <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s claim to part of the state. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> delivered his annual speech amid tight security after police warned that Sikh militants might launch attacks. In his speech, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> attacked `` traitorous forces'' in Parliament. He has accused political groups opposed to his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of espousing religious fundamentalism, especially within the country's majority Hindu faith He is scheduled to call general elections in the next four months, and he suggested repeatedly these groups are hindering the nation's development. The prime minister was elected to a five-year term in December 1984, two months after his mother and predecessor, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> spoke from the ramparts of the 17th century <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION>. He was flanked by foreign diplomats, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, and senior government officials. Authorities checked for hidden explosives in vehicles arriving for the ceremony. Visitors were frisked and sent through metal detectors. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> wore a white, bulletproof jacket over a white tunic and trousers during his speech celebrating Indian independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. A bulletproof glass shield on his podium was removed minutes before he began his 50-minute speech. Police officials said security was strengthened after they received reports that nine militants had entered the capital for terrorist attacks. Sikh militants in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> have been fighting for an independent nation since 1982. They have been blamed for 1,200 killings in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year and for bomb attacks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Tuesday's violence, however, was blamed on Moslem militants who apparently were trying to enforce a general strike in the <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. Government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON> said 27 people were injured when a hand grenade exploded at a vegetable market in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON> said the grenade, thrown at a police jeep, missed and instead exploded among morning shoppers. He said no one was injured in three other bomb attacks around the area. <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON> blamed the attacks on `` Kashmiri militants and secessionists,'' which are terms used by the government to describe pro-Pakistani groups. <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, a predominantly Moslem city, is about 62 miles west of the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which claims part of the state as its own. Three Moslem militant groups called the strike in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> to protest what they said was `` forcible occupation of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Sinhalese radicals enforced a one-day general strike Tuesday, the latest in a series to protest the presence of Indian soldiers trying to end an ethnic civil war. Traffic virtually halted in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and other parts of this island off the tip of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Most businesses closed. Soldiers patrolled the city and policemen stood guard at major intersections and bus stops. Sinhalese militants of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who have conducted a campaign of strikes and assassination against the government for two years, had distributed posters warning people to stay indoors. The campaign began after Indian troops were deployed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> two years ago to try to help end the war involving separatists in the Tamil minority demanding a homeland in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who has been negotiating with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for a phased withdrawal of the estimated 43,000 soldiers, urged people to refrain from violence. `` No room should be left for the slightest undermining of the sovereignty of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' he said in a reference to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s declaration that it would not withdraw while the Tamil insurrection continues `` Every practical step should be taken to ensure total peace in the north and east by taking into consideration the realities of the situation,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said in a statement released by the government. Most Tamil rebel groups laid down their arms, but the largest, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, continued the fight against the Indian soldiers. A military official, who can not be identified under standing rules, said the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> ambushed and killed four Indian soldiers Tuesday in <LOCATION> Morawewa </LOCATION>, 145 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. At least 1,000 Indians have been killed since they arrived after the peace accord of July 29, 1987, and the Tamil war has cost 10,000 Sri Lankan lives since it began in 1983. The Indians are deployed only in the northeast, where most Tamils live, but the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> says their presence compromises Sri Lankan independence. It also claims the accord made too many concessions to Tamils. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government blames the Sinhalese radicals for 4,000 killings since June 1987, including at least seven on Tuesday, which brought the total to 79 in four days. Tuesday's strike coincided with the 42nd anniversary of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> At least two <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> dailies refused to carry special supplements on the occasion, sources at the newspapers said privately. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese. Most Tamils are Hindus and Sinhalese are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, an overwhelmingly Hindu nation, became involved because it is the regional power and 60 million of its people are Tamils.

 A man who repeatedly stole eggs from the nests of endangered sea turtles was sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison.

<TEXT>
 The drop in mortgage interest rates that began in March is being offset by the prohibitive high cost to first-time buyers, causing only a `` modest rally'' in sales of existing homes for the rest of the year, a real estate trade group said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said the interest rate declines will result in across-the-board sales increases, but not at last year's level. Earlier high mortgage rates had caused sales to fall 3.1 percent in the spring. `` Falling rates are likely to trigger only a modest rally,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> chief economist. While rates are falling, an <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> survey of 83 metropolitan areas showed housing costs rising during the second quarter, pricing many prospective first-time buyers out of the market. Twenty-two areas posted median prices above the national median price of $ 92,900 during the April-June period, the <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> said. Forty-three areas recorded an annual median price increase exceeding the national price increase of 4 percent. The median price means that half of the homes sold for more and half for less. The growing range of metropolitan prices indicates that some area's housing costs have reached a level sufficient to shut out entry-level buyers indefinitely, said <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>. The group is urging federal legislation containing help for first-time buyers including expansion of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s mortgage insurance program and a down-payment assistance plan. In its report, the <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes fell in the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.72 million units. The survey covered sales of single-family detached homes, town houses, apartment condominiums and co-operatives. But mortgate rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent in March, have fallen since then to 9.96 percent last Friday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said consumer response lagged the mortgage rate drop but should be felt in the third quarter. `` Now, the people who can afford to get in the market are house hunting,'' he said. Affordability, however, is a problem for many. The <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> survey showed that prices of existing homes rose in all regions during the second quarter. But while the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> posted the slowest increases, it still had the highest median pricetag of $ 145,900. Elsewhere, prices rose 18.7 percent in the West to a median cost of $ 139,700; 4.9 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to $ 70,900; and 4.6 percent in the South to $ 84,700. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area was ranked as the most expensive market, with a $ 265,700 median price. It was followed by <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, $ 262,500; <PERSON> Anaheim-Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ana </PERSON>, $ 247,600; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, $ 218,000; and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, $ 188,600.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has awarded a total of $ 200 million to 46 organizations under the Targeted Export Assistance program for the fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1, the department announced Tuesday. Under TEA, as the program is called, trade associations get funds to carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products. The program is aimed at countering or offsetting adverse effects of unfair foreign trade practices on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their own money in carrying out specific projects. The amount of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that oversees the program. The $ 200 million allocated by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is the same as for the current fiscal year, a level set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1989 appropriations legislation. Officials said the 1990 allocations will be finalized after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completes work on next year's appropriations bill. The largest amount for next fiscal year was $ 15.4 million reserved for <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to promote raw cotton in overseas markets, followed by $ 12.5 million for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Japanese in Beijing Take Precautions Against Terrorist Threats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese living in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> took special precautions Tuesday against possible attackd by an obscure terrorist group calling itself the `` Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad.'' The group had said in death threats received as long as a month ago that on Tuesday its members would start killing two Japanese businessmen or tourists a week to retaliate for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` economic invasion'' of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The threats, contained in letters sent to Japanese in cities nationwide, have led hotels and businesses to tighten security, Japanese businessmen said. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which received the first threat in July, said arrangements had been made to improve security at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport. `` We have n't done anything special ourselves, but stricter security measures are being taken by the public security office at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport,'' said <PERSON> Shigeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suetsugu </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> manager. Additional plainclothes and uniformed guards were posted at the Jinglun Hotel, which is popular with Japanese businessmen and where the airline's ticket and reservations office are located, <PERSON> Suetsugu </PERSON> said. About 230 Japanese businessmen living and working at the Minzu Hotel in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> met with the hotel staff to plan extra security precautions. The measures included hiring additional guards and implementing mandatory registration of visitors in the evenings, said <PERSON> Toshimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON>, manager of a trading company operating from offices in the hotel. `` All the hotels are looking out for the Japanese,'' <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON> said. `` Of course we do n't really expect anything to happen, but it's better to take precautions. Japanese Embassy officials said no special measures were planned beyond earlier warnings to nationals to take precautions such as varying their routes to work and staying indoors at night. As of late Tuesday, no attacks or incidents involving Japanese nationals had been reported, the embassy said. Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said Thursday his ministry was considering lifting an advisory against non-essential travel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said the advisory would remain in effect for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which has been under martial law since May 20. Martial law was imposed because of the pro-democracy movement that was crushed by military forces on June 3-4. Most of the Japanese living in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> left following the military suppression of the student-led movement. Airline employees said virtually no Japanese tourists are traveling to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but most Japanese businessmen have returned to their jobs. `` We're just going ahead with our work as usual,'' said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't spend all day worrying. After all, there are extremists in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, too.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON>, who has managed a trading firm in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for four years. `` The protests last spring seem to have brought some of those groups out into the open here in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, too,'' he said, referring to organizations such as the Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad. Some Japanese say the threats have cast a pall over living and working in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We do n't expect anything to happen, but the threats make it impossible for us to move around freely. It makes life here rather grim,'' said <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION>'s Suetsugu. `` It would be a lie to say I'm not worried. It's creepy.''

 Eighteen rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport and residential areas Tuesday, killing and wounding some civilians, the government said. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said there were civilian casualties but he had no figures. He said there were no casualties at the airport but sources there said a soldier was wounded.

Reporters trying to enter the airport were turned away by security guards. Moslem guerrillas, who began fighting the government after a communist coup in April 1978, control most of the countryside around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other cities. Soviet military forces entered the war in December 1979, but completed a U.N.-mediated withdrawal Feb. 15. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said rockets destroyed two houses about half a mile from the airport and others hit a bus station and shopping center. The airport sources said several rockets landed in front of and behind the main passenger terminal of the civilian section during the busy morning hours when several flights were arriving and departing. No information was available on damage or casualties in the military section. All passengers in the terminal were safe but departing flights were delayed, one airport official said. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 299 rockets have hit the city in four weeks, killing 188 civilians and injuring 483, not counting casualties from Tuesday's attacks.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday endorsed complaints made by Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was keeping interest rates so high that the central bank was impeding economic growth. `` I do n't know of any president, now or in the past, who does n't favor lower interest rates,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in response to a question at a news conference `` I can feel very comfortable with his -LRB- <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s -RRB- sallying forth and saying that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think I've said essentially the same thing in the past.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> on Sunday criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> for pursuing interest rate policies which he said could be pushing the country toward a recession. He said the central bank should ease credit further to keep the 6 -LCB- - year-old economic expansion alive <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said that if the country does suffer a recession it will be because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> `` erred on the side of caution'' in keeping interest rates high in an effort to guard against inflation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped a question on whether he agreed with <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s assessment on who would bear the blame for a recession, saying he would take that question `` under advisement.

<HEAD>Opening of Wallenberg Files Raises Hopes of Solving Mystery</HEAD>

 A Soviet offer to open files on <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, the Swedish diplomat missing since World War II, has raised hopes of unraveling the mystery about his fate. But an official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said Tuesday the material will show <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> is dead. <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, who was credited with saving tens of thousands of Jews from Nazi concentration camps, vanished after his arrest by Soviet troops entering <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, in January 1945. The Soviets say files discovered in 1957 showed <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, who would be 77 today, died of a heart attack in prison 30 months after his arrest. But Soviet dissident sources have reported seeing the Swedish diplomat in labor camps during this decade. The Stockholm-based <ORGANIZATION> Raoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wallenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has been invited to send a four-member delegation, including <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s closest relatives, to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for talks on his disappearance. The group is to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in mid-October. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s relatives `` probably will have the opportunity to acquaint themselves with all the materials we have on the <LOCATION> Wallenberg </LOCATION> case, including the materials on his death in 1946.'' There was no explanation for <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON>'s reference to 1946 for <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s death, given previously as July 1947. <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> issued Swedish passports to 20,000 Hungarian Jews slated for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps. His intervention with German authorities was credited for the survival of another 100,000 Hungarian Jews. The Soviets never explained why he was arrested but many historians believe he he was mistaken for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy.

<TEXT>
 Federal investigators hauled twisted portions of a light plane to <ORGANIZATION> Keesler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> Tuesday in hopes of determining what caused a crash that killed Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his pilot. `` So far we do n't have any significant findings. The wreckage is being removed for further examination,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON>, regional director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` The preliminary examination did not reveal anything significant. So basically we do n't have anything to suggest what may have caused the crash.'' Searchers on Monday found the body of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 45, along with that of pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Vierling </PERSON>, 58. Authorities said the pair's single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 177 crashed about 9:30 p.m. Sunday into a dense south <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> forest <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a freshman Republican from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s 5th District, threw out the first pitch in a youth baseball tournament in <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION> and was returning to his home in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> city about 70 miles to the south. <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said volunteers from Keesler used a path cut by a bulldozer during the search to remove wreckage. A <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy, who declined to give his name, said no portions of the plane were found intact. <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator was being assisted by about five other people, including personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the aircraft's manufacturer. He said they were interviewing witnesses and would examine the plane's engine. Nothing about the positioning of the crash debris offered any clues about its cause, <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said. `` There was nothing significant about the wreckage itself, nothing strange, nothing extraordinary,'' he said. There was no indication that foul play had been involved in the crash, but it had not been ruled out, <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herring </ORGANIZATION> said. But <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said, `` We have no reason to suspect foul play at this point.'' Officials say the plane apparently clipped a 70-foot-tall pine tree and disintegrated on impact. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will be mourned at a two-day public memorial Wednesday and Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coliseum </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, officials said. The gray-haired former sheriff and police chief went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a hard-line stance against crime gained in 22 years of law enforcement experience and quickly impressed colleagues with his knowledge of the law. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> won a position on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, breaking a Republican tradition of appointing only lawyers to the panel. `` Because of his background and hard-working manner he gave every indication of becoming a star,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm just absolutely heartsick to lose somebody like -LRB- <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> -RRB-,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who ordered state flags flown at half staff. `` Our hearts and prayers go out to his family. He and I were real good friends, even though we were in different -LRB- political -RRB- parties. He was easy to work with.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was the second congressman in as many weeks to die in a plane crash. Earlier Sunday, the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and 15 other people were found in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> with no survivors. That plane disappeared Aug. 7 on a flight to a remote village. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s survivors include his wife, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON>, a daughter, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, and a grandson.

<TEXT>
 The prosecution in the tax evasion and extortion trial of hotel queen <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> rested its case Tuesday after six weeks of testimony in which former employees called her a penny-pinching tyrant. But even before the last witness had completed his testimony, attention was focused on the defense presentation. At issue is an accounting report that claims Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, are actually owed $ 681,000 in tax refunds during 1983-85, the years charged in the indictment. In arguments at the start of the day, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said defense attorneys had given him a copy of the report Monday afternoon. He complained to U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> that the rules of evidence mandate that the defense turn over such documents at a much earlier date. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who appeared upset at the development, admonished Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>. `` I am extremely disappointed in defense counsel for not furnishing this earlier,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` To me, it is inexcusable and I ca n't understand why it did n't happen.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said that if he allows the report to be admitted into evidence, the trial could take a month longer than expected because the government would need to rebut its conclusions. The judge also indicated that he may grant the government a delay to review the report and its underlying documents. If he does this, the trial could continue into September. He reserved his decision on whether to admit the report into evidence. The government `` needs to have absolute and complete disclosure of every aspect of this offer of proof,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` That includes finding out from the accountants when they were retained, what they had to say and what the basis is for their testimony.'' The report itself has not yet been made public. But <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> and another lawyer for Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruton </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, have described it during arguments. They said two outside accounting firms reviewed the tax returns of several Helmsley-owned partnerships from 1983-85 and found that the accountants who prepared the returns had incorrectly calculated the depreciation of property. These alleged oversights, the lawyers claim, resulted in an overstatement of the Helmsleys' personal income. <PERSON> Bruton </PERSON> said the report concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> overpaid $ 90,000 in taxes in 1983, $ 13,000 in 1984 and $ 578,000 in 1985. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, is charged with evading about $ 1 million in federal taxes by charging about $ 4 million in personal expenses to Helmsley-owned businesses. Two former aides, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, are being tried for assisting in the scheme. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> are additionally charged with conspiracy to extort payoffs and merchandise from vendors doing business with the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> organization. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, 80, was also charged but was severed from the trial for health reasons. The last of 42 witnesses to testify was <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesnevich </PERSON>, a handwriting expert hired by the prosecution to review invoices, memorandums and other documents submitted during the trial. <PERSON> Lesnevich </PERSON> identified the initials and writing of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her co-defendants on the documents. When <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> stood and said the government had rested its case, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> smiled and appeared relieved. Previous witnesses had portrayed Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> as an abusive boss who sometimes forced suppliers to charge her personal expenses to her business. Even her attorney conceded that she was `` demanding'' and `` abrasive.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> tried and failed Tuesday to change the federal mind and win presidential approval for his plan to dismantle a new nuclear power plant. `` I do n't think anything was done to change the governor's mind. I do n't think anything was done to change the president's mind,'' Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said outside the White House. `` We have n't seen anything new in the information the governor gave us.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> for nearly an hour Tuesday after <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he wanted to see the president personally to make his case for dismantling, rather than mothballing, the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant 50 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s northern shore. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> left the president with a 2-inch-thick binder of information on <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> and a list of 10 questions he would like the administration to answer about <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> and nuclear energy. The questions generally expressed great skepticism about the feasibility of mothablling the plant. `` We left it that the -LRB- administration's -RRB- energy planners would talk to my planners, that the president would ask people at Energy and presumably his staff as well to read the book, to read the 10 questions, and to get back to us with answers,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. `` He was precise about saying that we were entitled to answers and we would get answers.'' The governor declined to characterize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction to the presentation, but said it was a positive sign that the president had even agreed to the meeting. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said the federal government's attempt to derail the tearing down of the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear power plant amounted to usurpation of state's rights. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is presuming to tell the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> what plants it can build, whether or not it should mothball the plants, whether or not it needs environmental impact statements,'' he said. `` There's no such authority in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, nor has anybody ever attempted anything like that in all the years of this federal government.'' But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> disagreed, calling <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s argument `` a red herring.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has charged the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> with fashioning a national energy policy,'' he said. `` The law says that we're supposed to speak up, we're supposed to make decisions, we're supposed to do what we can to see to it that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have affordable energy and have the supplies of it that they need. The Energy Department argues that the 813 megawatts that <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> can produce are needed to ease possible power shortgaes in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, and that replacement power would mean burning more environmentally harmful fossil fuels. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> asked in July for a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after White House chief of staff <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the plant should be mothballed, not dismantled. `` We want to wait for the people of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to realize that the plant is needed,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said at the time he did not expect to be granted an audience with the president because it would put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the embarrassing position of admitting he was ill-informed. But at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> they could get together. The federal-state debate over <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>'s fate has been running since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, both of whom have been strongly pro-nuclear and pro-Shoreham. The Democratic governor blasted the administration for its `` unjustified and arrogant interference'' in trying to block a shutdown settlement negotiated between the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which built <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>. The state has long maintained that the area around <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> could not be safely evacuated in the event of a nuclear accident. Under the settlement, the state will buy the $ 5.5 billion plant for $ 1 and have it dismantled at the company's expense. In return, the company has been guaranteed annual rate increases of about 5 percent for at least a decade. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> homeowners and businesses already pay the highest electricity rates in the country. Although the deal has been approved by various state agencies and company stockholders, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has said it would seek to prevent it from going through by opposing transfer of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>'s license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must approve the transfer, and the department has tried to slow that process by asking the commission to order its own environmental review of the impact of closing <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> and freeze staffing there. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also joined a private lawsuit that challenges the Shoreham shutdown on environmental grounds.

<DATELINE>EL ESPINO, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist rebels attacked a newly built police academy Tuesday with mortars, rockets, dynamite bombs and rifle fire, wounding two policemen and five cadets, authorities reported. The attack, which began with a mortar barrage early Tuesday, awakened residents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espino </LOCATION>, located just west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and two nearby communities. A rebel spokesman telephoned local radio stations and said 25 guerrillas carried out the assault. He gave no report of rebel casualties. He said the raid was part of an offensive he called `` The armed struggle for democracy will not be detained.'' He read a communique that said the academy, where several hundred recruits are trained, was turning out `` agents of repression.'' The armed forces press office said several buildings in the complex were damaged. An army helicopter gunship arrived shortly after the attack began and illuminated the area with dozens of red flares. As they withdrew the guerrillas left mines that were removed by bomb-disposal teams. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting since 1980 to overthrow the government. It is estimated that about 70,000 people have been killed in the war. Both the 11-week-old rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and the rebels have indicated a willingness to begin negotiations on ending the conflict but no peace talks are scheduled.

 Authorities on Tuesday recovered the bodies of all 16 people killed in the crash of a plane carrying a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional delegation headed by Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>. A helicopter hovered near the face of a sheer cliff in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> as the bodies were hoisted up one by one from the rugged mountainside where the twin-engine plane crashed last week. They were flown to the nearby town of <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION> and placed aboard an Ethiopian air force C-130 cargo plane for the return to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. `` We've got them all,'' Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krejarck </PERSON> said upon his return to the capital from <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION>. `` The site has now been cleared. `` The weather gave us a break today,'' <PERSON> Krejarck </PERSON> said. `` It was sunny down there for the first time in days.'' The effort to retrieve the bodies of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, and his companions was stalled Monday by low clouds, rain and fog that shrouded the mountain, which is called <PERSON> Tam </PERSON>. About 50 American and <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> personnel were able to reach the site Tuesday, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The recovery teams were lowered to the base of the cliff by helicopters, then had to scale it to reach the wreckage and bodies, <PERSON> Krejarck </PERSON> said. A team of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigators arrived from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to work with Ethiopian authorities to determine the cause of the accident. The team included representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> companies, which made the body and engines of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s chartered Twin Otter. Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> said the bodies would be identified in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> by a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forensic experts, a process he said could take up to a week. Funeral and memorial service plans for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> were announced in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. A memorial service is to be held at 7:30 p.m. Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Hannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus. Mass will be said at 10 a.m. Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. There will be a private burial at a later date. In addition to <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, there were eight other Americans and seven Ethiopians aboard the twin-engine plane which disappeared in bad weather on Aug. 7 en route to the Fugnido refugee camp, about 350 miles southwest of the capital, near the Ethiopian-Sudanese border. Heavy clouds, rain and low visibility were believed to have led to the crash of the aircraft, which slammed into the 5,500-foot mountain about 100 miles from the refugee camp. After a six-day search, rescuers Sunday found the wreckage and bodies strewn over about a quarter-mile wide region of the mountain's severe slopes. A four-man congressional delegation planned to fly to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to escort the bodies home but officials have said they will not leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until the bodies have been identified. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a 44-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, was on his sixth visit to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and his second this year when the plane crashed en route to the refugee camp, one of four in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees that holds more than 300,000 Sudanese fleeing war and famine in their neighboring country.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s first general parliamentary elections in 22 years will be held Nov. 8, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> said Tuesday. His announcement, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the date was set by the 26-member Cabinet in accordance with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s election decree earlier this month. Interior Minister <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Massadeh </PERSON> said about 1,400 candidates would run for a parliament of 80 seats and candidate registration would start Saturday. A ban on political parties, in effect since a coup attempt in 1957, remains in force so candidates will run as individuals although they can be members of political organizations. <PERSON> Massadeh </PERSON> said more than a million voters registered in a 15-day period that ended Tuesday. About 1.2 Jordanians are eligible to vote. He said committees would begin examining the registration lists Wednesday and the procedure would take a week. Since the early 1950s, parliaments have been evenly divided between the east and west banks of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but voting on both banks has not been possible since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. A few district elections were held in 1984 to replace lawmakers who had died. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> suspended the old 60-member parliament last year after relinquishing sovereignty over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Election of the mew parliamewnt solely from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> will help seal the country's separation from the Israeli-occupied territory. The king approved a law April 17 calling for a 72-member body representing only the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. After four days of rioting over price increases later that month he promised elections by the end of the year. Political activists said the April election law did not distribute seats fairly according to population and it was amended in July to add eight seats for major population centers.

<HEAD>Researchers Enlist Tiny Wasp in Lyme Disease Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wasp no bigger than the dot of an `` i'' could play a big role in the fight against Lyme disease following its rediscovery by a victim of the ailment who was searching through old newspaper files. The state on Tuesday awarded a $ 15,000 grant to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> to collect chalcid wasps, reproduce them and eventually let them loose on the deer tick that carries Lyme disease. `` There's very exciting possibilities there for some control of the problem that has really panicked some people who summer here,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, senior county agriculture agent for <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard and <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> `` We need more information, but it looks like there's potential there,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesche </PERSON>, an entomology professor involved in the project. The minuscule wasp took on new prominence after a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` started to poke around in the Vineyard Gazette files,'' <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Engley </PERSON>, a 76-year-old <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard resident who had suffered two mild cases of Lyme disease, said he was trying to track down reports of an experiment he recalled from the 1920s. He found a 1937 article that reported a 1926 experiment in which chalcid wasps from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were released on the island to kill dog and wood ticks. That fit with a 1985 study that found the wasp's eggs had infested and were killing nearly 27 percent of the deer ticks on the island `` It's just a lucky break actually that it worked out that way,'' <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said. Local health officials then contacted the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> to explore the possibility of using the chalcid wasps for disease control. Lyme Disease, named for the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> town where it was first documented in 1975, can cause rashes, headaches and sore muscles, and, if not detected early, arthritis and heart irregularities. It can be treated with antibiotics. Between 5,000 and 8,000 cases of Lyme Disease are reported nationally each year, and 350 cases have been documented in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> since officials began documenting the disease in 1985, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Etkind </PERSON>, state epidemiologist. `` If this works, it could maybe reduce incidents by 35 percent,'' said <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commissioner of food and agriculture. `` That's 100 cases.'' The chalcid kills ticks by using a needle-like appendage to insert eggs inside the host. As the eggs develop, they kill the tick. The wasp also may help inhibit immature ticks from spreading the disease, health officials said. Researchers hope to begin work soon at a field station on <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesche </PERSON> said. If the wasps prove effective, state officials hope to have them commercially bred and used in conjunction with the current burning techniques and pesticides. `` It could be part of spring in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> would be releasing a box of these bugs,'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said.

 Drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> sounded a distinctly negative note Tuesday about the nostalgia that has welled up around the 20th anniversary of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> emerged from a White House meeting on anti-drug strategy with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to complain about `` memory distortion'' going on about the rock concert in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that captivated a generation in 1969. The 45-year-old <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a onetime guitar player and fan of early rock' n' roll, recited what he called `` the casualty list from <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'': rock performers, including singer <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, who died in later years from drug overdoses. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who as a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s had a blind date with <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, complained about the torrent of publicity marking the anniversary of the three-day counterculture festival. He said `` part of the legacy of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> was tolerance of drugs and let us be glad that is over rather than wishing it were back. We do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs. We've come too far.'' People `` have been hearing today and probably will hear ad nauseam over the next couple of days fond memories and nostalgia about <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, and there's a lot of memory distortion going on,'' he said. `` The next time you hear somebody gushing about <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> and ` Why ca n't it be that way today?' remind them of the casualty list from <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. `` In order of performance: `` _ <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, who died in 1970 of a drug overdose; `` _ <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, dead, 1970 drug overdose; `` _ <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> of the Who, dead of a drug overdose in'78; `` _ <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Butterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON> died of a drug `` <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> was a time of a great deal of tolerance for drug use and it was also a time of a great deal of death, because of the tolerance of drugs,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>.

 A man sought in the death of a `` Night Stalker'' trial juror committed suicide Tuesday and admitted in a note to killing the juror during a domestic dispute, authorities said. Hours earlier, Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> sent the jury home to recover from the shock of <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> said he hoped the jury could resume deliberations Wednesday, and lawyers for both sides said they wanted to avert a mistrial in the year-old trial. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, 51, shot himself in the head at 10:30 a.m. at a motel in suburban <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> after sheriff's deputies received an anonymous phone tip that he was there, said Deputy <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehner </PERSON>. `` He came out of his room onto the balcony, put a fully loaded unidentified caliber handgun to his head, and shot himself,'' said <PERSON> Wehner </PERSON>. `` He died at the scene.'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> had been sought for questioning in the killing of <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, 30, his live-in girlfriend, who was shot at the couple's <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> home, <PERSON> Wehner </PERSON> said In a note, <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> admitted killing Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> in a domestic dispute, but the note did not elaborate, the deputy said. Defense and prosecution lawyers said they believed the jury, with an alternate replacing Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, could continue working toward verdicts on the serial murder charges against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 29, a drifter from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is charged with 13 counts of murder and 30 other felonies. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is the devil-worshiping `` Night Stalker'' who raped, robbed and murdered victims in a 1985 rampage that terrorized <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> does n't want a mistrial. He wants to go forward,'' said attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` He's like the rest of us. Nobody's happy about this. It's a very sad thing.'' Some of the jurors were in tears as they arrived in court Tuesday. `` I think there is a tear in the eyes of a lot of us,'' <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> told the panel. But he stressed that Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s slaying `` had nothing to do with this case.'' Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s battered body was found Monday after she had failed to show up for jury deliberations that morning. <PERSON> Wehner </PERSON> said she had been beaten before she was shot many times. Neighbors told police the couple had fought over the weekend and one woman said she heard gunshots. The judge selected an alternate to replace Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>. `` It is tragic,'' the judge said. `` But what happened to her does not add or diminish to the evidence of whether Mr. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is guilty or innocent. `` I do not mean to be callous,'' he said, `` but we have business to do.'' He recessed court for the day. `` I think we all have been terribly affected,'' he said. It was the second time in five days that a deliberating juror had to be replaced. On Friday, a juror was dismissed for sleeping during the talks and an alternate was substituted. In addition to the 12 regular jurors seated from the beginning of the trial, 12 alternates were chosen. As of Tuesday, five had been sent in as regular jurors.

 <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s administrator on Tuesday ordered that 1,200 policemen who had served in a paramilitary unit be confined to their bases for retraining. Adminstrator-general <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> said the policemen had been members of a disbanded counter-insurgency group known as `` <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>,'' the Afrikaans-language word for `` crowbar.'' He said the action was designed to ease tensions as the territory, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, heads toward independence. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> said the relative calm in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> allowed the policemen to be `` confined to bases where they will undergo reorientation and retraining to equip them for roles that are to be redefined.'' `` If the situation should in any way deteriorate ... I shall consider the steps that would need to be taken in order to restore law and order,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials, including Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, had said that former <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> members were intimidating civilians in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and should be removed from the 6,000-member Namibian police force. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military and civilian personnel are in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to monitor the transition to independence. The territory has been administered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since World War I under a mandate from the defunct League of Nations. <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> squads played a leading role in the South African-led security forces battle against guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SWAO -RRB-. Most Koevoet members were black Namibians. Some civilians accused the unit of brutality and atrocities. It was disbanded in January. Many ex-Koevoet members have been integrated into the regular police force. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> had argued the ex-Koevoet fighters were needed to guard against possible attacks by <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. Under a U.N.-backed regional peace accord, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to free the territory beginning April 1. But on that date, some 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas crossed into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, setting off three weeks of fighting that threatened to derail the independence plan. But the peace process is back on track and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win pre-independence elections in November. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> said he decided to confine the ex-Koevoet members to the bases after <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials assured him that the threat of a <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> attack had subsided.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday promised a `` balanced, decisive, effective and achievable'' national drug plan, backed by more federal money, to meet Americans' demand for action. He declined to say where the money would come from `` because the final decisions have n't been made.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not raise taxes, `` but we are going to expand federal expenditures.'' He added, `` We will have to do some reallocation of resources.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> focused on the anti-drug campaign on his last day at the White House before leaving for a three-week vacation in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He told reporters at a news conference that his drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has given him an outline of the developing national drug strategy. `` It's balanced, decisive, effective and achievable, and it will target all aspects of the problem. It will call for commitment and sacrifice and understanding, but it's clear to me that the American people demand no less,'' he said. He said final details of the plan will be worked out over the next several weeks before he announces the specifics on Sept. 5. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s proposal would target drug users, as well as strengthen enforcement. A draft of the plan obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> calls for users to be arrested and fined and to lose their driver's licenses, their cars, their federal grants if they have any <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed whether to put federal financial muscle behind such proposals in a meeting Tuesday with his Domestic Policy Council of advisers. As drafted, the plan would withhold federal highway funds from states that did not revoke drug offenders' licenses, and it would withhold federal criminal justice funds from states that do n't perform drug tests on people in the criminal justice system Schools receiving federal money would have to have firm prevention programs. White House spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was still weighing those ideas. During his presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported revocation of drug offenders' driver's licenses. The draft strategy would seek a 49 percent increase in federal treatment money for 1990, to $ 925 million; $ 1.2 billion for new prison construction; a $ 200 million increase for state and local law enforcement, and $ 50 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, most of it for security improvements at public housing projects. The president, asked Tuesday if he planned to cut other programs to fund the anti-drug war, said he could not state where the money would come from, `` because the final decisions have n't been made. But we will have to do some reallocation of resources, there's no question about that.'' Pressed on how he would come up with the funds, he added,' ` We're in a period of hard times in the sense that we do n't have all the money that we would like to spend in several areas. At the same time he expressed determination to reduce the federal budget deficit and stay within the spending limits set by congressional budget writers. Some law enforcement professionals and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have criticized the anti-drug plan being developed by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> under the legislation that established his job as too reliant on enforcement solutions. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s resolve not to raise taxes to fight drugs. `` To make real progress on this issue, it is going to take a massive commitment of resources to law enforcement, drug treatment programs, drug education, and more. If that means raising taxes to pay for drug-fighting measures, so be it,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We should not let the politics of ` read-my-lips' stand in the way of a full scale effort to arrest the drug epidemic.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that his plan will lay out `` terms of accountability for all aspects of this problem, whether it's the treatment side or the education side or the law enforcement side, and we're holding ourselves accountable.'' `` We're saying in 10 years, there's going to be a lot less drug use,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday met with two groups of community anti-drug activists to get their opinions on what must be done. Among them were the parents of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college student killed by members of a drug cult. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, among about three dozen people meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, later said tougher enforcement is needed. Their son's body was found in a mass grave outside <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Drug treatment experts said after the meeting that they did n't dwell on where to get the money for the anti-drug fight <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't know how the funds are going to be reallocated. But I know there is a total commitment to fight this war on drugs on all levels and, if there has to be some shuffling of resources, I'm certain they are astute enough to figure out exactly how to do that.'' The president, in his remarks, was asked if drug-producing countries should be penalized if they fail to cooperate in stemming the flow of drugs. `` I would n't be opposed to that, provided they were able to cooperate with us,'' the president said. But he said he has `` a certain responsibility to look at the problems that are facing some of these countries with limited armed forces of their own, with very complicated insurgencies in their countries and to formulate a foreign policy that takes these things into consideration.'' He expressed the view that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s leadership wants to help, for example, but that its effort is hindered because <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> `` has been ripped asunder by the drug cartels,'' with many judges and officials assassinated.

<TEXT>
 State officials Tuesday approved a far-reaching blueprint to clear the polluted skies of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> so the state can meet federal standards by the year 2007. <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieder </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor serving on the nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, characterized the board's plan to clean the nation's smoggiest air as a `` leap into a ` Brave New World.''' `` But it's either that leap, or we wake up one morning and discover that it's ` The Day After,' and that we did it to ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbray </PERSON>, a board member and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor. The board voted 8-0 to adopt the plan, despite industry opposition that prompted the board two months ago to request additional information from the regional agencies that developed the program. The plan was branded `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> justice'' by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>, a commercial developer leading a coalition of business and labor interests battling to revise the smog cleanup effort. `` They're acting as their own judge, jury and executioner,'' <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> said. But while two reports were presented to clarify questions raised by business and political interests, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> made no changes in adopting the plan. `` Those people who oppose the plan are going to have to look at how they plan to accomplish the same goals,'' said ARB Chairwoman <PERSON> Jananne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON>. `` So far, the alternatives offered have come up very short of the goals, or they do n't have any authority for doing what they want to do.'' The unprecedented plan represents a comprehensive approach to improving air quality, using land-use planning, transportation programs and stricter standards for industry smokestacks, automotive emissions and petroleum-based fuels. It was finalized last March, following more than five years in development, by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>. The first part of the three-phase program calls for enacting more than 120 rules that would require, for example, the chemical reformulation of aerosol sprays and stricter controls on industry smokestacks. Existing smog-control rules were incorporated in the plan, but it also serves as a blueprint for the future by outlining the process for adopting new rules and by planning for the use of anti-pollution technologies yet to be perfected. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin has the worst air pollution in the nation, and has been working under a court order to comply with standards set by the federal Clean Air Act and enforced by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Air quality measurements for El Monte Tuesday showed ozone levels at about 15 hundred parts per million, an unhealthy level, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichhorn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District. `` It was unhealthful, but for August in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> it was pretty good,'' <PERSON> Eichhorn </PERSON> said. Following the board action, state and two regional agencies can begin enacting the plan's clean air provisions, even though the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has yet to give its approval, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessa </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is the only state with its own standards for vehicle emissions, and has led the nation in reducing smog by pioneering new standards and such devices as the catalytic converter, <PERSON> Sessa </PERSON> said. Last June, for example, the board tightened its emission standards, which exceed federal standards for several pollutants, for automobiles to be produced in 1993 and afterward. The board also plans to require improvements in computerized pollutant control equipment in cars, tighten state smog check requirements and set new standards for petroleum-based fuels. <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> refused to say whether his group, the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, plans to file a legal challenge to the plan, although he said that's an option to be considered.

According to the newsweekly <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is looking into `` whether <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON> wittingly or unwittingly is being used by individuals who give him information in order to manipulate the stocks he writes about.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, an associate director in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement division, declined to comment on the report Tuesday, citing commission policy against confirming or denying reports of investigations <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON> denied that he had been a party to any manipulation. `` I'm so careful and sensitive about what I do,'' he said Monday night when reached at his home for comment. <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON>, who also is a commentator on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Moneyline'' program, said he knew nothing about any investigation `` I have not been contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> or anybody else,'' he said. `` I think it's a lot of crap.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petruno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON>'s editor at <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, also said he knew of no investigation. `` We have no idea where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News got this information or who its sources are,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The bones of the five suspected victims of cannibal <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> were reburied Tuesday in a simple yellow pine coffin as a minister prayed for all victims of `` crime and evil.'' In a ceremony devoid of flowers or music, the scientists who dug up the bones last month placed them in five compartments inside the 4-foot-by-4-foot corduroy-lined coffin. Four <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> clergymen spoke briefly to a crowd of about 150 gathered at the hilltop grave before the coffin was lowered 8 feet into the ground. A steel plate was placed over the coffin to discourage vandals. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was the only survivor of a snowbound party of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> gold-seekers that was trapped in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> during the winter of 1874. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> claimed one member of the party killed the other four and <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was forced to kill him in self-defense. He said he ate their remains to survive. He eventually was convicted of manslaughter and served time in prison, but maintained his innocence until his death. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who wanted to separate fact from legend about <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, led a research team that dug up the bones last month. The bones and other artifacts found in the common grave were transported to the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> for analysis. But time and money shortages forced the reburial of the bones earlier than the scientists had hoped. Last week, <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, curator of physical anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, said they found at least four of the victims were bludgeoned to death in butcher fashion and then were carefully defleshed. They also said there was no visible evidence that any had suffered gunshot wounds. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said Tuesday that the only answer scientists found in their examination of the remains was that the victims were murdered and cannibalized. `` We found nothing to corroborate or refute anything <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> said,'' <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We'll never know who did it based on any solid physical evidence. We're never going to know.'' When the bones were dug up in July, the expedition took on the air of a light-hearted historical circus. Reporters descended on the community and T-shirts with slogans such as `` have a friend for dinner'' and `` taste the high country'' sold briskly. On Tuesday, the Rev. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> of the Presbyterian Community Church began the reburial ceremony with a prayer for victims of `` crime and evil.'' Three other ministers, representing the other religious communities of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, population about 400, addressed the gathering of local residents and tourists. Then the scientists placed the bones in the coffin compartments and served as pall-bearers. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarman </PERSON>, who owns the property on which the remains were buried, placed five grapevines and eucalyptus leaves on the coffin before it was lowered into the common grave. Dressed in a black jogging suit and black tennis shoes, <PERSON> Jarman </PERSON> said she's pleased the bones have been returned to the place where they were dumped in burlap sacks 115 years ago. `` They've become my little friends,'' she said. A headstone erected on the site in 1928 or 1929 was to be restored to its place and the site opened to tourists Wednesday.

 About 3,000 Greek Cypriots holding lighted candles marched Tuesday to the U.N.-policed Green Line to protest the Turkish occupation of Famagusta, once a flourishing tourist resort. The Green Line divides the island into <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriot zones. The marchers, led by <PERSON> Famagusta </PERSON>'s former Mayor <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Voyatzis </PERSON>, walked through <LOCATION> Dherenia </LOCATION>, a suburb of the now-deserted port city, to a checkpoint. There they handed a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officer a petition calling for Greek Cypriot refugees to be allowed to return home. `` Greeks and Turks must live together,'' the demonstrators shouted. The demonstration marked the day in 1974 that Turkish troops seized Famagusta after invading <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The Turks invaded after a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking to unite the island with with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Before the march, a message from President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader, was read, saying `` We reiterate our determination to return to our homes in the Turkish-occupied north, but we are trying to achieve this through peaceful means.'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> referred to U.N.-sponsored talks being conducted with Turkish Cypriot leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> aimed at reunifying the island as a two-zone federated state. The Green Line that splits the island is guarded by a 2,300-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force that has served in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> since violence flared in 1963.

 Gay Men's Health Crisis on Tuesday urged New Yorkers who may have AIDS to seriously consider being tested for the disease, a change of emphasis that the group said was based on medical and political developments. While the organization has been skeptical about testing in the past, its director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, said it was reassured by a state confidentiality law and encouraged by evidence some drugs can extend the lives of AIDS patients. `` We've always said think about it,'' said <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>. `` The difference is that if you thought about it in 1985 you probably would n't want to get tested. If you think about it in 1989, you probably will want to get tested.'' The organization was not recommending the test be taken, <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> said, because the decision was a personal one. <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> placed ads headlined, `` Think about it,'' in the city's four major daily newspapers Tuesday. They noted that the drug AZT can slow development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and treatments such as aerosolized pentamidine can prevent some AIDS-related illnesses. <ORGANIZATION> GMHC </ORGANIZATION> provides counseling for people with AIDS and lobbies in their behalf.

 <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> stunned Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, with a late-charging, 146-vote victory in the Aug. 1 primary, in which five other Democrats were eliminated. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, whose resignation after seven years as state legislator is effective Aug. 29, won the four-way race for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination with 83 percent of the vote. Her campaign manager is <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president's son. Little difference on issues emerged between Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> in their runoff, dominated by discussion of ethnic divisiveness, qualifications and ability to defeat Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>. In late charges, Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who raised money for Democratic candidates in 1988, for contributing $ 2,000 to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said he attended a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dinner at a friend's request and his campaign countered that Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> campaigned with then-candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> Her campaign said she appeared with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in her role as a city commissioner.

<HEAD>Valdez Moving Into Drydock For Nine Months Of Repairs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Shipyard workers on Tuesday began moving the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> from a pier to a dock where the tanker that caused the nation's worst oil spill will be repaired over the next nine months. Tugboats helped guide the 987-foot ship into the repair dock, which is only 3 feet wider than the 166-foot-wide Valdez, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Workers plannd to tow the Valdez from its current berth at a <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION> pier into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, then turn and back it stern-first into the dock. The vessel was launched three years ago from the same dock, which resembles a huge swimming pool separated from the bay by a moveable gate. The crippled ship was returned to <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where it ran aground March 24 in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude into the sound's wildlife-rich waters. Repairs to the ship and its shredded hull were expected to cost about $ 25 million. Dockmaster <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a veteran of more than 40 dockings, said he would use up to eight tugs to coordinate the ship's movement while monitoring the tanker's position through a team of divers and surveying instruments. Shipyard workers were not expected to start repairs this week because it will take about six days to remove all the water from the dock. `` I suspect there will be a two-week period in which the only people in there will be lawyers and engineers,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutter </PERSON>. Once inside, the gate will be closed and <ORGANIZATION> NAASCO </ORGANIZATION> crews will start draining water from the repair dock. After lowering the water level about six feet, which takes about four hours, the <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> will come to rest on blocks and supports that will hold the ship while it's being repaired Five clusters of 24 adjustable jacks, each having a 250-ton capacity, have been installed to maintain an even keel when the ship is lowered. A level landing was crucial because the tanker otherwise might slide off the blocks and damage itself and the repair dock, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they plan to return the tanker to service, though possibly under a different name, after repairs are completed. The <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> arrived off the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> coast July 10 after being towed more than 2,000 miles from Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. But its entry into the bay was delayed three weeks after oil slicks were sighted near the vessel. The ship pulled into the NASSCO yard on July 31.

 Parked amid the tents and trailers littering the alfalfa field, the site of rock' n' roll's most memorable concert 20 years ago Tuesday, was a jeep with the license plate `` TV Junkie.'' It was in the right place. <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'s 20th anniversary party was a premier media event, with dozens of reporters elbowing each other to find out if the peace and love generation had lost its way in the 1980s. A forest of satellite dishes surrounded a plaque that commemorated the epochal three-day concert that attracted some 400,000 spectators. <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> veterans and wistful `` wannabes'' barely had the chance to formulate their reminiscences before being asked to share them with the world. `` You want my favorite quote?'' <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, called out as a reporter wandered by a tent thick with tattoos and tie-dyed shirts. `` We feel like we're at the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> _ only we're the attraction.'' Much to some people's disappointment, there was no organized celebration of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'s 20th anniversary at the late <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>'s one-time farm Rather, it was a free-form party, as tourists mingled with campers staking their turf under the watchful eyes of dozens of cameras. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and her friends said they'd been interviewed about a dozen times. Their favorite came Monday night, when they crowded around a campfire and shouted `` Goodnight from <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'' on cue to a cameraman from <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` This has turned into such a media event,'' she said. `` Back then, they -LRB- reporters -RRB- were n't even into the heart of it. It took 20 years for the spirit to sink in.'' But the attention has its downside, she said. `` A lot of people are drawn toward the cameras,'' she said. `` A lot of people are behaving because the press is looking.'' That did n't stop one man with a cast on his foot from holding up a marijuana cigarette. When questioned by a reporter, his companion said she was from <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. Twenty-year-old <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Frangipane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> said she'd been camping at the site for the last four days, `` because we were n't there last time I'm getting tired of saying that.'' She said she made the same statement the day before to a German television crew, or was it a French team? A makeshift stage crammed with speakers stood at the bottom of the natural amphitheater where <PERSON> Richie </PERSON> <PERSON> Havens </PERSON> launched the original <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> with a three-hour show. `` Anybody who has anything just gets up and plays,'' Frangipane said. Despite hopeful rumors spreading through the crowd that the Grateful Dead would make a return engagement, the stage was empty Tuesday afternoon. Makeshift hot dog, souvenir and T-shirt stands lined the country road leading to the field, where several hundred people were gathered Tuesday. A representative of the field's current owners, <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, collected $ 5 from each carload for `` field restoration.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 42, put a guitar in the back of his car and drove up from <LOCATION> Coventry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, for the day. He'd already been interviewed by reporters from enough channel numbers to make up a lottery card. He was n't at the original concert, but said he was glad to experience it this way. `` I did n't really know what to expect. I found it to be quite interesting. We've met some pretty nice people,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The second flight of the B-2 stealth bomber was scrubbed Tuesday because a preflight checklist took too long to complete to get a full day's flight test completed, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. Col. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisert </PERSON>, the B-2's deputy program director at <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFB </ORGANIZATION>, also blamed the weather and said in a telephone interview, `` There was nothing wrong with the airplane. `` We expected winds to come up and we wanted to make sure we could get in a full day of activity,'' he said. A statement released at <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said: `` The second flight of the B-2 has been delayed because of the crew rest requirement. They have been on duty on preflight status for the maximum time for safety.'' Air Force officials did not specify how long was the allowable duty day for the B-2 crew. Flight crews, however, must be allowed sufficient periods of rest depending on the requirements of the mission. The three - to four-hour second flight, which may include retracting its landing gear, faster speeds and higher altitudes, was initially planned for Saturday but was postponed After a five-hour delay on Tuesday, the ominous-looking flying wing emerged from its hangar at about 12:30 p.m. and rested for about 90 minutes before the mission was scrubbed. Captain <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman reached at Wright-Patterson said, `` It looks good for tomorrow.'' On its July 17 maiden flight, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> test pilot <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> flew the B-2 for nearly two hours and reached an altitude of 10,000 feet without retracting the landing gear. The B-2, a tailless, 172-foot-long wing with bulges in the middle, was described by Couch as a `` very nimble aircraft'' and `` a lot of fun'' to fly. The $ 530 million, four-engine bomber, engineered to elude radar detection, is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, along with the conventional B-1, replace the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s aged B-52 bomber fleet that forms part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear deterrent against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The so-called stealth technology combines advanced composite materials and a special shape to create a plane believed to be undetectable by enemy radar. Though the bomber is still being developed, stealth fighters have operated for several years. The government has already invested about $ 22.4 billion in the B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has balked at the thought of paying more than $ 500 million apiece for 132 bombers. On July 14, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal 1990, but stipulated no money could be spent on the B-2 until it flew. Despite the bomber's first successful flight, however, congressional opposition remains. Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> last month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes. A list of 156 B-2 contractors in 26 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was declassified. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants $ 4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal year, and it may need $ 8 billion in each of the three years of peak production, 1992 to 1994.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers rushed a prison Tuesday and shot to death 16 convicts who had been holding members of religious group hostage for three days. Five hostages, including a 9-year-old boy, were killed. Among the slain hostages was an Australian missionary who one of the freed captives said had been raped at knifepoint the night before she was killed. Officials reported it was decided to storm the prison after some of the 15 hostages escaped and told them the would-be escapees had killed other captives. `` We were not ... dealing with reasonable people,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Silvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bello </PERSON>, who was involved in negotiations with the convicts. `` We had to authorize a military operation, especially since there was an urgent need to save the five living hostages.'' The attack began about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firing automatic weapons and secured the downtown jail in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, after about 40 minutes, witnesses and officials said. A few hours earlier, the convicts had tried to escape by using hostages as shields. During the confusion, a captive was killed and five others fled. They told police four other hostages had been slain. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, a missionary from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, was among those slain by the convicts. Her body was found dumped outside the detention center with a bullet wound in the chest. The Rev. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, one of the freed hostages, said Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> and some of the nine other women hostages were raped. Other freed hostages said they heard the women screaming on Monday night. `` <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> told me about the incident,'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said Tuesday. The standoff began Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> said inmates overpowered a guard during a Bible session at the prison and then looted additional weaons from an armory. All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group. The leader of the convicts was identified as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Naser </PERSON> <PERSON> Samparani </PERSON>, a former air force soldier convicted of murder. He had threatened to kill Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> unless authorities provided a getaway vehicle by 4 p.m. Tuesday. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Samparani </PERSON> then changed his mind and said the inmates wanted to flee the prison immediately. The convicts emerged a few minutes later with their captives and began firing, the military said. <PERSON> Samparani </PERSON> and a 16-year-old female hostage were killed then. The remaining inmates withdrew into the compound with the other hostages. Five hostages escaped in the next hour and told authorities at least four other captives were dead. They included Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, 36, who had been in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> one month, and a 9-year-old boy. Officials quoted them as saying the captors also raped some of the female hostages. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON>, the regional military commander, said none of the hostages was killed in the military assault. Police said most of the inmates had escaped in April from the <ORGANIZATION> Davao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colony </ORGANIZATION> and seized several hostages to protest conditions at the prison. They surrendered after being promised they would be transferred to the Muntinlupa prison, in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb, but they were not moved.

 Many minorities infected with the AIDS virus are not seeking new life-prolonging treatments because of a lack of information and distrust of the medical establishment, doctors and social workers say. Poor blacks and Hispanics are under-represented in AIDS clinical trials where experimental therapies are tested, and they often do n't seek treatment until they are sick enough to qualify for free medical care, said AIDS caseworkers attending a government conference on AIDS and minorities `` They're not as well-educated about prevention and they do n't have a cousin who is a doctor who can tell them about the latest drug that's being tested in a clinical trial in their area,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an assistant attending physician in obstetrics and gynecology at <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> Also, the poor are often suspicious of attempts to get them into medical research, she said.

<TEXT>
 If there can be an unsung hero in opera, especially in a monumental extravaganza such as `` Die Meistersinger von <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>,'' it would have to be the chorus master. Despite the central role of the 97 singers, the largest chorus in any <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> production to date, the man charged with welding them into a crisp ensemble with flawless diction and perfect pitch gets no major billing and takes no bows. What <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON> does take is unabashed pride in his work. `` I'm always in charge, because I have to be,'' he said. `` I get very good results with the chorus.'' In an interview at a rehearsal earlier this month, <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON> waxed enthusiastic during a parade scene that brings more than 100 people on stage in the third act. `` You see that? Active, energetic. They really are the populace, not just 100 sticks, people singing notes,'' he said. The 63-year-old <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON> became chorus master five years ago after occasional work as associate chorus master, coach for principal singers and other jobs with the opera dating to 1968. `` I brought him in,'' said <PERSON> Speight </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think there's a better chorus master in the country.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who spent two years as host of the television series `` Live From the Met'' and eight as music critic for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON>'s crowning achievement was a fight scene with 135 people on stage in the second act. `` For three minutes they are in a wild melee, singing and fighting on stage. Then the night watchman's horn is heard, and everyone vanishes,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. The libretto calls for 16 separate vocal lines _ for example, four soprano sections _ each exchanging epithets. In previous modern stagings, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said, `` they simply have each line of people sing all the words.'' Director <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochaix </PERSON>, however, decided that to be true to <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s libretto, half the singers in each line should sing one epithet and the other half the response. `` People are going to hear a difference, a clarity of lines, I hope,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> has done such extraordinary work that the people are able to do this. He taught it to them -LRB- to sing -RRB- faster than he ever thought <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- could conduct it.'' With the slightest breakdown in timing, anything less than perfect pitch and diction, the music would sink into cacophany. `` I think we've rehearsed that fight scene 30 or 40 times. It has n't fallen apart yet,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` Die Meistersinger,'' one of the longest operas at six housrs, poses other challenges as well. Total costs are likely to exceed $ 1.6 million for seven performances Aug. 3-19. `` A -LRB- new -RRB- production on the scale of ours has not been done since the Met's -LRB- The Metropolitan Opera -RRB- in 1962,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` Everybody likes to do ` Die Meistersinger.' It's just that they ca n't afford to produce it.'' A quarter or more of the cost goes for costumes, sets and other one-time expenses. Under a contract with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Musical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>, full-time choristers get $ 8 an hour for rehearsal time, plus a performance fee, for a total of about $ 1,200 for `` Die Meistersinger,'' while auxiliaries earn as little as about $ 100 total, said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a soprano in the chorus since the company was founded 25 years ago. `` They all have jobs like anybody else,'' <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON> said. ` Some of them are housewives, of course, but that's a full-time job, too.'' Regulars, including those from past seasons, must survive an audition every two years. About 190 singers were heard in special auditions to choose the 61 auxiliary choristers in `` Die Meistersinger.'' The chorus, which began rehearsals May 18, sings the opening and closing lyrics, and `` Die Meistersinger'' is one of handful of operas in which `` the people'' comprise a central role. `` <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> composed this opera as a strong statement of the German people,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` In each of the acts, the people have a very strong role to play.'' Set in 16th-century Nuremberg, the opera tells the story of <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a cobbler and master singer who winds up serving as principal judge in a song contest among the town's apprentice master singers. To the victor goes the hand and fortune of <PERSON> Eva </PERSON>, the beautiful daughter of the town's wealthy <PERSON> goldsmith </PERSON> and the object of <ORGANIZATION> Sach </ORGANIZATION>'s own unrequited love The cast includes <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Roloff </PERSON> as <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, soprano <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Donath </PERSON> as <PERSON> Eva </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benn </PERSON> <PERSON> Heppner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bergitta </PERSON> <PERSON> Svenden </PERSON> in other lead roles. `` Die Meistersinger'' is the seventh new <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> production for <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. Since he took over in 1983, the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> has risen to No. 6 in attendance nationwide, and <ORGANIZATION> Wagner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has declared it `` without a doubt the leading <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> company in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The company is best known for annual stagings of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s four-part `` Der Ring des Niebelungen'' from 1975 to 1987, the first nine years in English as well as German <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, hired largely to overhaul the Ring, presided over new productions of `` Die Walkure'' in 1985 and of `` Das Rheingold,'' `` Siegfried'' and `` Die Gotterdammerung'' in 1986. Despite the company's overall financial health, annual productions ended in 1988 because of persistent operating deficits for the $ 3.5 million summer extravaganza and what <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> saw as a lack of sufficient local corporate and individual donations. He has said he hopes to revive the Ring for performances every two or three years, starting in 1991. The Ring's legacy is evidence this year with the return of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> as conducter, <PERSON> Rochaix </PERSON> as director, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as lighting director and soloists <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roloff </PERSON>, who sang <PERSON> Wotan </PERSON> in 1984, 1986 and 1987.

 As one editor at People magazine recalls, there was no `` burst of pride'' among the staff when some of their stories began appearing two years ago on a televised edition of the weekly. But <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingo </PERSON>, the magazine's assistant managing editor, says `` People Magazine on TV'' is winning over the more than 150 writers, editors, artists and production staff as it prepares to air its fifth edition on Wednesday. `` Some of them were disappointed in it in the beginning,'' he said of the staff's reaction. `` I believe this next show is the best reflection yet of what the magazine is all about. It feels like the magazine.'' The staff was concerned, he said, because a quality TV show would stimulate sales of the magazine, which sells a majority of its copies on newstands. Generally, no subject airs unless it already was in print. This time, the one-hour special on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> includes an interview with <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> in which the singer strikes back at those who claim the couple will split, and a segment about <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s fight to save an endangered Hispanic community. It also looks at the case of a woman who has been in jail for two years because she refused to allow her daughter to visit the ex-husband she claims raped the girl. It takes the viewer to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> to hear about the successful efforts of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> couple who went there five years ago to teach local residents the importance of making their government protect wild animals being killed off by poachers. And it includes an interview with professional tennis player <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> and a first-person narrative from the mother of two 5-year-old conjoined sisters. <PERSON> Wingo </PERSON> said the mix of celebrity interviews, features and more serious subjects is closer to what the magazine strives to publish each week. The magazine went through the same sort of search for the best combination of stories when it started, he said. `` Nobody had ever done this before. We kind of made up the rules as we went along,'' <PERSON> Wingo </PERSON> said. Duplicating the broad mix of 20 to 25 stories in the magazine was difficult on the televised special, which could only include six to eight segments, and it irritated the magazine's staff, he said. But <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, supervising producer of the TV special, said he'd `` like to think we've always reflected the magazine.'' `` Many of our stories were covers,'' he said. `` We look at the magazine and try to think of stories that will translate well.'' <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> said the show has improved since the arrival of <ORGANIZATION> KCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> anchor <PERSON> Bree </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who was host for the first time when it aired last in April. `` I lean toward the hard news features, that's my bent,'' she said. `` One of the things that they wanted to do was try to make ` <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> on TV' a more topical and newsier show. Issue-oriented features will be a bright spot of this next show.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> added: `` We have to be a little forgiving the first time around on any new show.''

<HEAD>Inflation Stopped In Its Tracks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An inflationary thrust that began in 1987 and seemed to be gathering momentum was blunted in July, according to a small-business survey with a record of accuracy. `` What appeared to be an inflation-gathering-steam has suddenly dissipated,'' said Prof. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who conducts the survey for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s school of business and management, said the change was clearly reflected in written responses from 1,851 small - and medium-size businesses, and was abrupt and substantial Prior to the latest survey, responses showed actual and planned price increases had steadily increased for nearly two years, raising until recently the fear of a broad-based resurgence of inflation. That fear was shared by many economists, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and even by some <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisers, but based on the latest responses, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said that `` at least for the moment, the momentum in prices has been blunted.'' The survey, which examines existing conditions and attitudes about the future of prices, hiring, inventories, borrowing and various other factors, seeks to obtain an indication of economic conditions six months hence. Many of these indicators are then synthesized and expressed in a `` Small Business Optimism Index,'' which last month rose slightly to 99.8 from 99.5 in the second quarter of this year. For comparison purposes, the third quarter of 1975 is assumed to be 100, meaning the latest index approximates the expectations of small and mediuum-size businesses at that time. The index, begun in 1974, reached its highest reading of 108.7 in the first quarter of 1984, and remained above 100 with just two exceptions until the second quarter of this year. Its low was 81.1 in the second quarter of 1980. The latest measurement, said <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, suggests a modest improvement over the second quarter in the outlook for business conditions and business expansion, although the future of the economy as a whole stays a bit negative. Analyzing the report, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said more companies expect a deterioration of economic conditions than improvement over the next six months. Unemployment might drop slightly, then rise modestly. Interest rates will fall a bit. In the professor's estimate, the current weakness in interest rates `` is more a result of weakening credit demands than of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> easing.'' Earlier studies have shown a reluctance of many firms to take on debt in recent years. In the late 1970s more than 50 percent of respondents said they were regular borrowers, but since 1981 that rate has not exceeded 44 percent. For many companies, he said, the direct impact of higher rates, should they occur, is n't large. More important, he said, might be the impact of higher rates on cash flow, since it might affect customers and discourage buying. The survey is conducted among the more than 500,000 member companies of the federation, which range in size from proprietorships to a relatively small number of companies with sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars. What the federation does not represent is the top tier of perhaps 1,000 companies in terms of sales, such as those represented on the Fortune 500 list of largest companies, and whose views are more often sought in surveys. However, the federation points out that the economic segment represented by its members employs about half the private, non-farm work force and produces about 50 percent of the nation's goods and services. Measuring economic sentiment from this half of the economy thus involves a greater spread of business experience and opinion.

<HEAD>Civilian Politicians Seek Ways to Get Along With Chile's Military</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The political opposition is pursuing an unprecedented dialogue with the armed forces, seeking a formula for peaceful co-existence when <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> returns to civilian government in March. The military, which has ruled since 1973, has indicated a willingness to negotiate, but only under certain conditions. Both sides agree that the lack of communication in the past had led to a mutual animosity and distrust that both sides agree must be eliminated if the future government is to enjoy stability. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, the presidential candidate of a united center-left opposition and heavily favored to win the presidential election Dec. 14, recently remarked: `` We want an approach, an exchange of views.'' `` The isolation that has existed for years among civilians and military is not good for the country and must end,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> added. `` The time has come for a dialogue.'' Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the right-wing army commander who has been president since seizing power in September, 1973, was obliged to call December's general elections after losing a referendum in October on extending his rule to 1997. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> and other opposition leaders want the dialogue to take place before the new government takes office March 11. Experts expect several highly conflictive items will be on the agenda. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a leading adviser to <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> on military matters, said the talks would include the role of the armed forces under the civilian government, the continuation of the present commanders-in-chief in their posts, the defense budget and, probably the most sensitive problem, how the new government will deal with the human rights violations during <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule. After the 1973 coup, which toppled the elected government of <PERSON> Marxist </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvadoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, the military launched a campaign of political repression. Thousands of leftists were arrested, many were tortured, killed or sent into exile. Human rights groups have documented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by seurity agents. The opposition has said that it will investigate all pending cases of rights abuse and try those responsible. Its leaders have also said they will seek to repeal an amnesty law, issued by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, that pardoned violations occurred from 1973 to 1978. That announcement by the opposition prompted a stern warning from the military ranks. Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON>, the air force commander who is considered politically moderate and has expressed support for a dialogue, said repealing the amnesty law could unleash `` an unpredictible reaction'' by the armed forces. `` Those wanting to repeal the law do not realize how serious that could be,'' <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> added. He noted that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself has warned that an attempt to try military officials could lead to an interruption of the democratic transition. Opposition leaders have insisted they seek `` truth and justice,'' not vengeance against the military. They are under heavy political pressure from human rights groups representing victims of repression or their relatives. Another highly controversial subject is the constitutional clause that allows the military chiefs, including <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, to retain their military commands under the civilian government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has said he will remain the army's leader for as long as the constitution allows _ until 1998. Even some pro-government politicians contend the new leadership must be empowered to make changes in the military command. But the armed forces have vowed to make no concessions on the point. A statement issued by the army warned the armed forces are prepared to `` use legitimate force'' to uphold constitution, which was drafted by the military and approved in a referendum. And military commanders insist that their mission includes ensuring internal stability as well as defending the country against foreign attack. That is considered another potential area of controversy, but opposition leaders say they are prepared to talk about it, too, in spite of the risks and difficulties. `` The peaceful end of military dictatorships has never been easy, and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> can not be an exception,'' wrote <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeliuk </PERSON>, a Social Democratic leader, in a newspaper column. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> also has urged civilians and military to talk about their differences `` to help the transition to democracy.''

<HEAD>Women See Hopeful Sign in West Berlin's Female-Majority Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Women around the country see a new female-majority government in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as a sign of a new age in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a test case that could influence their political fortunes in the future. Women hold eight of the 13 seats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the city's governing body. While the coalition of leftist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and environmentalists has held together better than many had predicted when it took office in March, it has been tainted by controversy. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, the state minister for youth affairs, has been accused of taking part in illegal gambling activities. Culture Minister <PERSON> Anke </PERSON> <PERSON> Martiny </PERSON> has come under fire in the press following allegations that one of her women staffers misused office contacts and mailing privileges to secure an apartment. But women defenders respond that what happened to the women is nothing more than the kind of trouble men get into. `` I would n't want to understate the seriousness of such matters, but it's fair to say that they are not problems specific to women politicians,'' said <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which governs in coalition with an environmentalist group. `` The fact that a woman is discovered to have taken part in something questionable does n't detract from the undeniable importance of this huge step forward for women,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, a taxi driver in his 50s, tended to agree. `` People are always looking for excuses to complain about the government, especially now with all those women,'' he said. `` They are n't doing anything the male politicians were n't doing, but everyone notices now.'' The eight women senators caucus over croissants and coffee each Tuesday morning in a ritual that has been called the `` Witches Breakfast.'' `` It is really quite productive, and it lets all these women blow off steam so that it does n't interfere with the whole <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s business,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Uebe </PERSON>, chief adviser to Ms. <PERSON> Martiny </PERSON> and an active the Social Democrat The women are credited with pressing for changes aimed at improving living conditions in this city of 2 million people tightly ringed by communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They have introduced measures to reduce air and noise pollution, improve housing availability and to expand day-care opportunities for the increasing numbers of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> women who work outside the home. While many Berliners attribute the atmospheric changes to the women's influence, they likewise are blamed for decisions and edicts that do n't sit well with the public. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s interior minister, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Paetzold </PERSON>, decided in July to require that official correspondence be gender-neutral. For example, a male resident is a Berliner, and a female is a Berlinerin. The unisex term is BerlinerIn, with the second `` i'' capitalized. What has become known as the `` Big I'' decision has been widely ridiculed as silliness resulting from the female majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hanna-Renate </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurien </PERSON>, a former senator of the out-of-power <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` perverse.'' <PERSON> Monika </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, one of the founding members of the women-only Artemisia Hotel and art gallery in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, says the new government has awakened the West German women's movement. But she and others also maintained that it has left some men feeling defensive and threatened. `` For a long time many people have confused emancipation with sexual alternativism,'' Ms. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Women are doing things for themselves, and men fear their power is being reduced.'' A member of the city government's 35-women advisory council on family and social affairs, Ms. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said the women in positions of authority now recognize that they have to move carefully to achieve what they want without undermining their electoral support. Meanwhile, women politicians in other parts of the country keep a close eye on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to gauge their own standing with voters. `` The Berliners have given the situation for political women a step up, but we are seeing this in other areas of the country as well, in smaller cities,'' observed <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sehrbrock </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` What kind of example the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> coalition poses remains to be seen, but it has certainly raised everyone's consciousness.''

 BAN NON SAO-AE, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The war has nothing to do with them, but without warning it comes roaring in often on the 729 people of Ban Non Sao-Ae who make their living by farming. The war is <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s _ government forces fighting rebels _ and the villagers have the misfortune of living close to the border where the fighting frequently breaks out with artillery barrages that send shells crashing into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. `` Bunker'' is one of the few English words that have worked their where also.'' <PERSON> Dum </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankeja </PERSON>, 64, said he also will stay. <PERSON> Dum </PERSON> and his wife share a bunker with three other households, and he said adversity has brought the villagers closer. `` We have to go through this together. We help each other out. If we go into the bunker, we go in together.'' Less fortunate was <PERSON> Somwang </PERSON> <PERSON> Janpit </PERSON>, 22, one of at least three villagers who recently lost legs to landmines. In June, he was searching for bamboo shoots in a deserted field. He thought the blast he heard was someone shooting birds _ until he saw his right leg was gone. `` Yes, I'm angry,'' he said. `` Now I ca n't take care of my father and mother.'' His mother, 63, now toils nine hours a day in the fields to feed him, his handicapped sister and their father, 84. At the village school, anything that sounds like gunfire sends the children dashing for the bunker on the compound. Heavy shelling last year shattered several school buildings. But most students have learned to cope, a teacher said. `` Their homes are here in the village. When they hear it -LRB- the shelling -RRB-, they are scared. When it's over, they go and play like children everywhere.''

 Islanders say there is a curse on this mysterious 700 year-old ruined city they know as the Reef of Heaven. The curse is so strong, they say, that no one will stay overnight. `` No way. The last person who stayed there was a <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> governor about 100 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Bermin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON>, director of tourism and natural resources for <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>, site of the city and one of the three island states that make up the Federated States of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>. `` He was found mysteriously dead the next morning. You would n't catch me there, no way.'' But <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> is more than happy for tourists to come in daytime to see a stone megalith that is one of the wonders of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. It is the prime tourist attraction of this impoverished, remote island 2,485 miles west of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Few people know about <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdol </PERSON>. No one has fully explained how it was built or who built it. Most Pacific islands never had a Stone age, but at <LOCATION> Nan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mahdol </LOCATION> the walls are made of stone blocks that weight up to 50 tons. Archaeologists believe the stones came from another island and brought to the site on rafts. But how laborers were able to lift them remains a mystery. It takes an hour by fast boat across a lagoon to reach the city. At low tide visitors must wade through a sea grass swamp and climb slippery rocks to the dark gray, moss-covered walls of the ruin. <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdol </PERSON> is a canal city built on 92 artificial islands 15 miles from <LOCATION> Kolonia </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>. Built near the passage through the coral reef into the lagoon, it covers 160 acres. Huge walls of basalt rock up to 20 feet high enclose a deserted city with burial chambers, vaults made of giant stone slabs and pathways of crushed coral. Scientists believe an advanced civilization built a seawall, a priestly burial place, and adminstrative center, servants quarters, a ceremonial center, a coconut-oil processing area and a communications center where messages were sent by beating log drums. Carbon dating of the ruins indicates the city was built between the years 1285 and 1485. Recent underwater archaeology suggests it might be even older. Legend also says <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Madol </PERSON> was created by magicians who then flew off into space. Nowadays, people of <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION> are divided over who owns the city. The local paramount chief, <PERSON> Salvadore </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, claims it is his. The government also claims it. At stake is who gets the revenues from tourism. `` I do n't ever want to see the day that a paramount chief and the government are fighting one another in court,'' said <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> the tourism official. `` It goes against all our traditions. But it is our greatest tourist asset.'' Last year almost 8,000 tourists visited <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>, a lush volcanic island which in turn was ruled by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is now the capital of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>, made up of the islands of <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Truk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosrae </LOCATION>, all formerly part of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-administered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> wants to build a road to the shoreline near <LOCATION> Nan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mahdol </LOCATION> to make the trip easier for tourists. He'd like to add a restaurant and souvenir shop. But no hotel. `` No one will stay overnight,'' <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> has thrown over the pursuit of money in <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Duet'' to chase his dream of becoming a pianist in `` Open House.'' It's not really a new show. In fact, it's as much a spinoff as anything else. `` Duet'' has been revamped, given the new name `` Open House'' and a largely new cast. <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> still plays <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, but now he has different goals. The focus has been moved to a real estate office where <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Placa </PERSON>, now works. `` It's about my wife coping with her new job as a real estate saleswoman. I'm a guy who's given up millions of dollars to follow his dream,'' <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> said. Last season, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> quit his in his father's patio business. `` <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> was pregnant and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> grew up and realized what was important. They now have a young daughter. I think they changed the show because <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> stepped in and ordered a change. They wanted something more controversial with the wife working and supporting a husband who is trying to find a new career.'' It's partially a case of art imitating life. <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>, who has a degree in classical piano and composing, had hoped to pursue his own dream. `` It was a typical case of a man biting off more than he could chew,'' said <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>. `` I wanted to be a pianist, a composer, then an actor, a producer and a director. I still want to do all of them, but in time.'' During the summer, <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, took off to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for the movie `` Dad,'' with <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We play Pop and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> at the age of 35. I cut my hair -LRB- and -RRB- grew a mustache,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> went through a remarkable makeup transformation that made her look like <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON>. I did n't think it was possible.'' The Lemmons, father and son, previously appeared together in `` That's Life.'' `` Pop and I are so significantly alike physically and temperamentally that I think we can only play father and son. That cuts down on the amount of work we can do together, which is tough because we love working together.'' The acting bug hit <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> rather late. He studied with his father's acting coach, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, and in the comedy workshop run by the late <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lembeck </PERSON>. His first series was the short-lived `` Brothers and Sisters.'' He appeared in some TV series and feature films, but his big break was being named `` The Aramis Man'' in the TV commercials. Before his marriage he worked only enough to pay the bills and support his skiing habit. `` One season I went to the slopes 55 times,'' he said. `` I sprained my thumb three times in one month. I lived in a cheap apartment and 12 or so commercials that I could do in two weeks would hold me for the year. `` What's more important? Your work or your life? I'm always concerned about people who say a career is the most important thing in their life. With me my wife and my family come first. I do n't think I could ever believe in the movie business ahead of my family `` After that comes the health of this planet. Then the health of the brothers and sisters on this planet. My career comes fourth. It's left me happy and sound spiritually. It works for me.'' <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> is also active in <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> and Save the Whales. He is working with several partners on a small film about <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumann </PERSON>, the German composer. `` His wife <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> made the money while he stayed home with their 11 children and wrote music,'' he said.

 Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in June as business sales fell 0.3 percent, the government said. Analysts said the report indicated slow but continued economic growth with low inflation. Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as production exceeds demand, a process that sometimes leads to a loss of jobs as businesses cut their output. Economists, however, said the inventories reported Monday are not unusually large in proportion to sales.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s tight-money policy, initiated last year to slow the economy and prevent inflation, has achieved its desired effect, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> economic research shows. An economic forecast prepared for release today predicts a `` soft landing'' following the implementation of the policy and 3 percent growth during 1990 with an unemployment rate of 5.7 percent. The forecast is based on a series of equations involving hundreds of economic variables that comprise the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Quarterly Econometric Model of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Economy, also known as the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Model. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> economist who helped prepare the forecast with Professor <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hymans </PERSON> and economist <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crary </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s policy in part caused economic growth to slow this year. `` The danger that runs in this type of policy is if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightens too much ... growth might slow down or become negative, and that would be a recession,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. She said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s most recent measurement showed that the economy is growing at a rate of 1.7 percent this year. The forecast indicates continued sluggishness but a pickup during 1990. `` While we expect slow growth for the remainder of this year ... we do not expect a recession,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. `` We expect renewed growth during 1990. That is contingent upon easing of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> toward the end of this year.'' According to the forecast, inflation is expected to hold steady at 4.4 percent in 1989 and 1990, then creep up to 4.5 percent in 1991. The gross national product will grow by 2.6 percent in 1989, 2.2 percent in 1990 and 2.9 percent in 1991, according to the forecast. Civilian unemployment is forecast to edge up from 5.3 percent in 1989 to 5.7 percent in 1990 and 5.8 percent in 1991. Automobile sales are predicted to hold steady at 10 million per year through the forecast period, a decline from the 10.6 million units sold in 1988. Housing starts are expected to rebound from 1.4 million units in 1989 to 1.7 million units in 1991.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> financial columnist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON> wittingly or unwittingly was used by individuals who gave him information in order to manipulate stock prices, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report.

When <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> bought shares in these companies, the companies' stock price rose.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar climbed today against the Japanese yen for the fourth consecutive trading day, and share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> also gained. The dollar closed at 142.20 yen, up 0.27 yen from Monday's close of 141.93 yen. It opened at 142.40 yen and moved between 142.20 yen and 142.70 yen. The dollar now has gained 3.35 yen over the last four trading days. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which declined 41.34 points Monday, climbed 139.07 points, or 0.40 percent, on Tuesday, closing at 34,810.69. The dollar opened higher following a rising trend overseas and moved upward during the morning session.

 When you ask people about <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, the savvy <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer nominated to head the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, they always start off by calling him `` very intelligent'' or `` extremely bright.'' `` He has the experienced, good mind that will stand him in good stead,'' former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said Monday after the nomination of <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, an architect of the savings and loan industry bailout, was announced. Even people who question the wisdom of the appointment, like Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>, start their criticism with `` Mr. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> is highly intelligent and did fine work on the S & amp; L reform package ...'' One industry source, who did not wish to be identified, said that because of his keen mind <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> does not `` suffer fools gladly'' and could be abrasive. But when <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> was gathering information for a task force chaired by then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on what financial regulatory rules needed to be amended or scrapped, said the source, `` We sent him some very difficult, complicated stuff. `` Usually, people in that position read it and do n't understand it or pass it on to someone else to read it. But when we met with him it was obvious he had read it and understood it all.'' Industry observers believe <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s wide-ranging experience will be an asset in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> position. `` He comes to this job with a fairly broad knowledge of the financial services industry,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees over-the-counter stock trading. A 1972 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a 1975 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> practiced securities law on Wall Street with the prestigious firm <ORGANIZATION> Cravath </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. He also worked for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the politically powerful <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Botts </ORGANIZATION>. From 1981-82, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> was an executive assistant to the undersecretary of labor. `` He's been a practitioner. He's been in government. He knows banking,'' said the industry source. `` He may get rid of a lot of junk along the way but he'll be doing his job.'' The White House announcement ended months of speculation about who would succeed departing <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> who announced in May he was stepping down. In contrast to <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, 60, an academic and legal expert who managed to keep his distance from the free-market philosophy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, 39, is known as a fierce fighter for the policies of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> helped write the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan for bailing out the nation's ailing savings and loan industry and then shepherded through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the plan to spend more than $ 150 billion over three decades to deal with the nation's biggest money problem since the Depression Before that, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, native who now lives in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, worked for and with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a number of capacities. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, now a presidential assistant for issues analysis, also helped fashion administration policy in dealing with the Exxon Valdez oil spill. He helped candidate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepare for the 1988 presidential debates with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. From 1982 to 1985, he was deputy counsel to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> also served as staff director on the task force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chaired to reform the financial regulatory system. `` I'm not sure if he's a regulator or a deregulator,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> investment banking firm of <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quist </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON>, who has known <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> since 1984, said the wiry and intense lawyer is `` interested in efficient, cost effective regulation. He knows the inter-relationships in the world of financial services, he has a broad view of what's out there and an extensive knowledge.''

 A striking telephone worker was critically injured in a picket line accident, and the only contract talks between unions and four strikebound regional telephone companies failed to make any gains. Meanwhile, customers of the four <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies continued to experience minor delays on operator-assisted calls, but a union spokesman said the strike by more than 190,000 employees would bite harder in time. `` The strike certainly has not seriously affected service,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, president of Local 1118 of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` But we know that after a while these machines that are running will show signs of lack of maintenance. You'll see more trouble as time goes on,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers were in the second week of a strike against New York-based <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> and San Francisco-based <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>. Union members at <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, joined the walkout Sunday. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> also are on strike at <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>. The strikes affected customers in 20 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> representatives presented a revised proposal to union officials at an hour-long meeting Monday, but <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Willer </PERSON> said the company's health insurance offer was `` unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Willer </PERSON> said the company continued to demand that workers pay deductibles plus half the premiums for relatives other than spouses and children. Efforts to shift some health care costs onto workers are a key issue in the four strikes. The three other regional phone companies _ Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> _ have reached settlements. The seven Baby Bells were formed in the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. No talks were scheduled at <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which serves 12.3 million customers in five Midwestern states <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> said their bargaining committees would meet Thursday in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to plot strategy before seeking any talks with <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries in their states. `` I do n't expect any talks before the end of the week,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bargaining committee. `` Right now I would say we're still a long ways off from getting a contract.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries have offered a three-year contract with an immediate increase of 5 percent, most of which would come in the form of a $ 1,000 signing bonus for lower-paid employees. Base wages would increase 2 percent in 1990 and 1991, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cose </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> said the offer would do little for lower-paid operators and clerks. `` The base pay has to increase enough to make it worthwhile for people to work there,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenefick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> picket <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, 34, was hospitalized in critical condition after a picket line accident in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>. Police Chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliva </PERSON> said an 18-year-old <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> employee was driving on the service road of a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> facility when her car brushed <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, after he and several other pickets gathered around her car and yelled at her. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> mounted the hood of the slowly moving car and pounded on the windshield, but slid off and hit his head on the pavement, police said. The union disputed that, saying he fell onto the hood and the young woman accelerated. No charges were filed. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> called the accident `` tragic'' and asked the union to resume negotiations `` to try and calm the waters. In other incidents: _ A <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> car was burned shortly after midnight Monday in a company parking lot in <LOCATION> Elmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Police said the fire was suspicious. _ Four strikers were arrested at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Telephone facility in <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, when they ignored police barricades. _ Two people were arrested outside <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> offices in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>. Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Conat </PERSON> said one allegedly obstructed a police officer, but he was n't sure about allegations against the other. _ Toll and 911 service was cut off to about 8,000 customers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> after vandals cut 11 cables. Residents in the area are still able to dial police or fire directly, C & amp; P Telephone of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> said.

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shares continued to rise with unconfirmed reports that several additional suitors were interested in aquiring the airline company. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.50 to $ 258.50 a share Monday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The increase followed a gain of some 56 percent last week following a $ 240 a share takeover proposal to <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> leveraged buyout firms <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also reportedly have expressed interest in buying the company, while officials of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have stated they were interested in a possible merger. `` It basically says the sophisticated players in the market ... believe that there will be other bidders for the company,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the amount of money that will be needed to take over <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> limits the number of potential bidders. `` It's not something anybody and everybody will become involved in,'' <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> said. The Wall Street Journal reported in its editions today that the airline, which is negotiating on a new contract with its pilots union, is also considering a possible management-led employee buyout. Weekend talks between <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and the pilots apparently were aimed at determining whether the airline's unions might agree to enough concessions to make an employee buyout bid viable, the Journal said. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would also have to win the support of the machinists union and other employees. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying the company. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> unit at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the union's financial and legal advisers were studying efforts to take over the company. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said today the airline had no comment on the report. `` It is our policy not to confirm or deny negotiations,'' he said. Analysts have said <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> could fetch as much as $ 6.75 billion and prospective bids likely would include a management buyout plan. The Journal has quoted officials it did not name as saying <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> had received nibbles from several groups, including companies that showed interest in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, Minn.-based <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> were among those who unsuccessfully made takeover proposals for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, which was sold to a group headed by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> for $ 3.65 billion. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment Monday on the report of additional bidders. `` We neither confirm or deny any other bids,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> also remained silent on the issue. `` The firm has said nothing and have n't made any comment'' on whether it is interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>. Officials of <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> also declined comment. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said it would make an offer if <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board asked it to. `` They have not publicly said they were up for sale,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manners </PERSON>. `` My understanding is that they did say they were going to explore some alternative.'' Last week, in response to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' overture, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors announced it would explore all possible financial and strategic alternatives open to the company.

 The stock market opened higher today behind a firming bond market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 9.29 points at 2,687.21 after 30 minutes of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.

The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index had gained 0.27 to 379.27.

 Corn and soybean futures opened higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after getting a boost from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-day forecast. The forecast issued Monday called for below-normal precipit ` tion and above-norlal temperatures in major crop areas. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that noted some detdrioration in soybean crop quality may have contributed to today's early gains. Analysts said the good showing in the soybean and corn pits should spill over into the wheat market. Wheat also should get support from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s bid for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under the export bonus program, which subsidizds grain sales to foreign nations, the analysts said. In early trading, wheat was a -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.99 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.31 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with September at $ 1.38 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 11 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 6.14 a bushel Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent to .23 cent lower with August at 74.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .27 cent lower with August at 84.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent to .37 cent lower with August at 47.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to .60 cent a pound with August at 24.75 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is n't likely to lower interest rates any time soon to boost economic growth, despite a pointed warning of recession from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, many economists say. Analysts predicted Monday that interest rates will hold steady because the central bank is satisfied it has done all it needs to keep the country out of an economic slump. Those economists suggested that comments by Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> might actually backfire and make the central bank less inclined to ease credit conditions for fear of appearing to bow to political pressure. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> complained that the central bank was keeping interest rates too high and would shoulder the blame if the country falls into a recession. `` If we do have a recession, I think it will be because they erred on the side of caution'' in fighting inflation by keeping interest rates too high, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' The White House tried to soften the sting from <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s message by praising the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on Monday for generally doing a `` good job'' but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today generally endorsed the comments during a morning press conference. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> for expressing his views, which he called `` very balanced.'' `` I feel very comfortable with his -LRB- <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s -RRB- sallying forth,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think I have said the same things in the past.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not know of any president who had ever come out against lower interest rates, but he stopped short of saying that he believed that if a recession did occur, it would be the fault of the central bank. Private economists were surprised by the timing of <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s criticism, given recent economic statistics such as a drop in the jobless rate in August that suggest the economy is n't as sluggish as previously feared `` There is virtually no chance that we will have a recession this year. So why stir up this fuss and get financial markets unsettled when you do n't have to?'' asked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting company. But other economists said they believed <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was positioning the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to take the blame if the economy does weaken and the country ends up in a recession right before next year's congressional elections. `` This is a classic situation of setting up the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to be the fall guy if something goes wrong,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> and other economists said it was unlikely that <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s remarks would have any impact on upcoming <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decisions <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers will meet again in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Aug. 22. Many economists said they expected the central bank to hold interest rates steady and not ease further given recent signs that certain key sectors, such as consumer spending, are rebounding. `` So long as the economy is OK, there is no reason for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease any more,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. From March 1988 through March 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> pushed short-term interest rates higher in an anti-inflation campaign The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reversed course in June and has made three modest moves to lower interest rates by making more money available to the banking system. Banks have been able to cut their prime lending rate since early June by a full percentage point to 10.5 percent. Home mortgage rates have declined as well, dropping below 10 percent to stand at 9.96 percent for fixed-rate loans. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said he believed mortgage rates have hit their low for the year and may even climb by about one-fourth percentage point in coming weeks as financial markets realize that the central bank has decided to hold off on further easing moves. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, consulting company, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was correct to pause before driving interest rates any lower. He said if economic activity turns out to be stronger in the second half of the year than forecast, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would run the risk of triggering higher inflation next year by loosening credit conditions too rapidly.

 The stock market slipped from earlier highs and turned mixed in moderate trading today. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.36 points to 2,682.28 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 6.64 points an hour earlier. Declining issues outnumbered advances by a margin of about 10 to 9 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 657 issues down, 611 up and 555 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 72.99 million shares. Analysts said the market opened higher in response to a firming bond market after declining on Monday. The stock market has moved in tandem with bonds since Friday, when the credit market plunged in response to a rise in retail sales that renewed inflationary concerns and diminished hopes that interest rates would go lower. But the stock market began to slip late this morning in what analysts said was a continuation of the correction phase after its recent runup. The market has climbed more than 10 percent since late June and about 30 percent since last fall. Wall Street analysts say the current market is now overbought and could drift for several sessions before resuming an upward march. `` We could see some more zigzagging today without any sustained movement either way until the market works out the overbought condition,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.16 at 191.53.

<HEAD>Chrysler Tentative Car Prices Up Average of 5 Percent for '90</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: AMer planned.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today tentative prices for its 1990 cars will increase an average of 5 percent over comparably equipped 1989 models. Nearly half the boost is caused by the installation of driver-side air bags in all of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s U.S.-made cars, expected to be about 1 million vehicles in the 1990 model year, spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. She said the average air bag will cost a consumer $ 450, less than what <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> pays to buy and install them. She refused to say exactly what the automaker is spending on the systems. The rest of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s price increase stems from economic reasons, including higher material and labor costs, she said. The federal government requires driver-side air bags or automatic seat belts on all cars made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after Sept. 1. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a tentative average price increase of 3.4 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its car prices could go up as much as 4.8 percent for the coming model year. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said a few of the 1990-model cars offered by the nation's No 3 automaker will decrease in price while the rest will increase between 2.8 percent and 6.9 percent. She said she did not have a list of all models and their price increases. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s final retail prices will be announced in September or October, she said.

<HEAD>Computer Software Maker Announces Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Software maker <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it would lay off at least 15 percent of its employees, or about 260 workers, and cut other costs in the face of expected additional losses. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 19.8 million second-quarter net loss on revenue of $ 59.5 million. Its president and chief operating officer, <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, resigned and his duties were assumed by board chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esber </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` The -LRB- workforce -RRB- reduction will be a minimum of 15 percent,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Duttenhayer </PERSON>, who said the company now has 1,731 employees worldwide. <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>, once a top manufacturer of computer software, recently has faced intense competition in its core business of software for the storage and retrieval of information in personal computers. It said reduced revenues, together with anticipated job-cutting costs and other expenses, may result in a larger operating loss for the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30, than in the second quarter that ended June 30. The company said its previously announced program to reduce inventories on the shelves of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributors and resellers is continuing. <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> also is going through a transition to a newer version of its dBASE IV software, and said shipments of the current version are expected to decline as customers wait for the new version. <PERSON> Esber </PERSON> said he will directly oversee the database business. `` This is another important step in restoring <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>'s profitability,'' <PERSON> Esber </PERSON> said `` The company's cost-reduction program will result in greater focus and execution on projects with the biggest impact on near-term revenues.''

 <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that improved sales in its fashion apparel business helped it post a 21.2 percent profit increase in the second quarter, while earnings doubled for another retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> reported it earned $ 98 million, or 74 cents per share, in the three months ended July 29, compared with $ 81 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue rose 5.1 percent to $ 3.51 billion from $ 3.34 billion. `` We expect to build on the current strong sales momentum, particularly in apparel lines, during the second half,'' said <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. `` Our significant sales growth has shown that our reputation for fashion apparel is growing.'' In the first half of the year, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> earned $ 226 million, or $ 1.71 per share, up 6.8 percent from $ 212 million, or $ 1.57 a share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue rose 4.5 percent to $ 6.92 billion from $ 6.62 billion a tear earlier. From <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said it earned a record $ 56 million, or 72 cents a share, in the three months ended July 29, up from $ 28 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue increased 15 percent to $ 3.10 billion from $ 2.69 billion a year ago. `` Strong performance by our three major operating companies led to the record earnings,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macke </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, said in a statement.

<HEAD>Sara Lee Posts Record Sales, Earnings for Quarter and Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced record fourth-quarter sales of $ 3.06 billion and earnings of $ 102.7 million, led by strong performances by the hosiery and underwear companies in its personal-products division. The sales figure represented a 5.5 percent increase over the $ 2.9 billion recorded in the year-earlier period, while earnings were up 17.9 percent over the $ 87.1 million logged in the final quarter of 1988. Per-share earnings rose to 86 cents from 75 cents. For the fiscal year ended July 1, sales were $ 11.7 billion, a 12.4 percent increase from $ 10.4 billion in 1988, and net income rose 26.3 percent to $ 410.5 million from last year's $ 325.1 million. Earnings per share to $ 3.50 from $ 2.83 a year earlier. While most consumers still associate the Chicago-based conglomerate with pastries, the <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> bakery division showed only a 6 percent increase in volume for the year. By comparison, sales were up 20 percent and earnings 28 percent for the personal products division, led by such companies as <ORGANIZATION> Haines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwear </ORGANIZATION> and L'eggs hosiery. `` That would n't come as a surprise to market analysts or the investment community,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON>. `` That's been the area of strongest growth in recent years. The fiscal-year earnings also reflected a pretax gain of approximately $ 87 million as <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> sold its <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Peck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries. Earnings also were affected by a $ 55 million charge for restructuring of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food operations.

 The stock market continued mixed in afternoon trading with blue-chip issues registering the biggest gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 9.11 points to 2,687.03 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 4.36 points at noon. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 107.01 million shares.

Traders said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stocks had come alive after recent lackluster performances. The market opened higher today in response to a firming bond market after declining on Monday. Prices slumped late in the morning in what analysts said was ongoing consolidation after its recent rally. The market has climbed more than 10 percent since late June and about 30 percent since last fall.

<HEAD>Workers Retake Assembly Plants Closed By Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of workers tore down black and red strike flags, unlocked gates and poured back to their jobs Tuesday at American-owned assembly plants closed over a union power struggle. `` We're waiting for the other union to come and try to take us out,'' said <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>, 22, an assembly line worker at the Nibco valve plant in this northern border city. `` We've been inactive for three weeks. We need our jobs,'' said <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>, a Nibco section chief. Maquiladoras are foreign-owned plants that take advantage of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s lower wage rates to assemble products to sell in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 900 workers, both men and women, defied a rival union and, unlocking gates, reopened 15 American plants closed July 25 when one union leader attempted to take control from another. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> put up strike banners and locked the gates of plants organized under leader <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. About 2,000 workers were idled by the strike, although they said the companies continued to pay their salaries. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> no longer could legally represent the workers because <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> had withdrawn from the Federation of Mexican Laborers, or CTM. But the workers said Tuesday that they want <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> as their union leader whether or not he's allied with the CTM. They're tired, they said, of waiting for government and judicial authorities to end the strike. `` We want the government to intervene. We want them to respect the contract we have with <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Veraza </PERSON>, a Nibco supervisor. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who had called for workers to return to their jobs, said Tuesday that he did so because `` they do n't have any reason to stay out.'' <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment. No American manager was on the premises of any of the plants as the workers calmly walked past the two or three guards at each gate. Once inside, each person went to work at his or her station, taking orders only from the supervisors involved in the retaking of the plants. The workers contend that <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> acted illegally when he forced the plants closed. `` Only workers have the right to strike,'' said <PERSON> Veraza </PERSON>. `` We're happy with the work the Americans give us They're giving us chances to advance.'' The state labor arbitration board had ruled in favor of <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, but the plants took the case to federal court asking that <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> be declared the official representative. The federal court has yet to issue a ruling in the case. All the workers interviewed said they expected <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> supporters to attempt to remove them from the plants. No action had been taken by the rival union, however, hours after the plants reopened. Two American companies, <ORGANIZATION> Invacare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and Pilling de <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, have said they'll pull out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> before being forced to sign a contract with <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. And the workers said Tuesday that they're concerned that if the plants are n't in operation, they'll close down. `` If the plants close down nobody is going to make sure we have jobs. We're not taking action against anybody. We just want to hold on to our jobs,'' said <PERSON> Nibco </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has not made a statement favoring one union leader or the other. Plant managers have made several trips to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> seeking an end to the conflict through the federal government. No decision had come Tuesday from either the courts or government officials. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, plant manager for the newly opened West Bend plant, said Tuesday that the workers' action proves their loyalty to <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. `` It's a loud signal from the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> people to the government that they want their jobs and they want to work and work under the representation of <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>,'' said King, contacted in at the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>. Asked when the American managers would return to the plants, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, `` We have to wait and see what happens. We are continuing to try to solve this legally.''

 Grain and soybean futures prices rose Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with the rise triggered by reports of deteriorating crop conditions. Monday's crop ratings from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> showed a decline in the condition of the soybean crop, particularly in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, due to lack of moisture. `` There was also a strike overnight in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` While it did not affect Brazilian soybean shipments, the psychology of that did n't hurt the beans.'' Soybean prices were also supported by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-day forecast _ released Monday _ which calls for below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures. Corn futures were boosted by the announcement that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would be in the market for 400,000 metric tons of corn and rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would also enter the market. Wheat futures were helped by light commercial purchases by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and carryover from the other markets, <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said. At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.99 a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.33 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.40 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 15 cents higher with August at $ 6.17 -LCB- a bushel.

<HEAD>Cable Giant Posts Larger Loss in 2nd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest cable television systems operator, said Tuesday its second-quarter loss widened to $ 63.6 million, citing higher interest expenses and increased losses by its affiliates. The company's loss for the three months ended June 30 was three times larger than its $ 21.9 million loss in the second quarter of 1988. Revenue for the second quarter rose 31.8 percent to $ 726.4 million from $ 551.0 million in the second quarter of 1988. The company said the increase in revenue was due to new cable television subscribers, increases in rates and acquisitions. <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION> said its operating income rose to $ 142.6 million from $ 125.4 million a year earlier. Interest expenses, however, climbed to $ 205.9 million from $ 138.8 million a year earlier, and its share of losses by affiliates rose to $ 29.7 million from $ 400,000 in the second quarter of 1988. `` Consummation of the purchase of a 42.5 percent indirect interest in <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the business combination involving <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have had a negative impact on <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings due to the cost of servicing the indebtedness incurred to finance the transactions and the resulting increase in depreciation and amortization,'' the company said. For the first six months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION> recorded a net loss of $ 115 million compared with a loss of $ 29.2 million in the first half of 1988. Six-month revenue rose 31.4 percent to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.05 billion a year earlier.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, trying to rebuild from a crippling strike and financial problems, on Tuesday expanded its schedule and cut its already discounted fares while adding the lure of refundable tickets. A union leader, meanwhile, said the new fare cuts for fall travel by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s healthier competitors would badly hurt <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to rebuild without its unions The discounts of up to $ 160 on a roundtrip fare were announced Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and matched over the next two days by carriers including <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for marketing, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had already planned new discounts before the other carriers and he said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fall promotion offers tickets that `` are much easier to use and a much better value in most cases.'' Besides competitive rates, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s discounted fares, beginning Sept. 7, have fewer restrictions and unlike the other carriers, allow full refunds on unused tickets. `` We've been ... planning a major initiative for some time. Our fares are very, very different. Our fares are like going to an ATM -LRB- automatic teller machine -RRB- and theirs are like trying to get a mortgage,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Eastern will require only three - to-seven-day advance purchase and its low fares are available nearly every day and carry no restrictive penalties The fares will affect all domestic markets, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said. The carrier increased Tuesday from 350 to 390 daily flights by adding 40 flights connecting <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and destinations mostly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and said it would fly 600 daily flights starting Sept. 7. Eastern's rebuilding plan proposed to its creditors calls for 800 daily flights by year's end and an airline about two-thirds its pre-strike size. While <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> says it has hired enough new pilots and is keeping up with maintenance despite its strike, it has been leasing five planes and crews from sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said more planes and crews will be leased from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as is Eastern, to meet the September expansion but that the practice is only temporary. Eastern union leaders, in their sixth month on strike, say the airline's claims to be coming back are misleading because their fares, as low as $ 39 one way, make it impossible to make money. `` The more they fly, the more they lose,'' Machinists District 100 President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> told a rally in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Saturday. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s priority is winning back customers and the company is pleased at 75 percent load figures as its tries to come out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. `` Indications are we're getting a warm welcome back,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` That's not to say that after a 5-month strike operating 10 percent of our service that there is n't a major challenge in rebuilding the airline. `` You have to first win back your customer base. We said in our business plan we would lose hundreds of millions of dollars between the comeback and the end of the year,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday that consumers are going to go with the other airlines because `` they are very reliable, first-line carriers. They're not having phantom flights and people do n't have to worry about losing their money. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> tries to go even lower than the rest of the carriers, that's just going to compound their problems. It's going to doom the rebuilding plan, which was already doomed,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. Before the strike that started March 4, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> normally had around $ 1 billion in revenue per quarter. Last quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> posted $ 89.6 million in revenue. Management last week hurdled a major barrier to its rebuilding efforts when a split in pilots union ranks resulted in at least 250 more pilots returning to work, boosting to 650 the union crossovers. Eastern said with its own recruitment and training program it now has the 1,700 pilots needed for its rebuilding plan. Eastern is still hiring flight attendants and mechanics to replace strikers. The unions are backing a buyout bid by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and are lobbying in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for presidential and congressional intervention.

 The dollar ended mixed in choppy trading Tuesday following a modest rise overseas. Gold prices firmed. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed up $ 3.60 at $ 370.70 a troy ounce. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 368.50 an ounce, up $ 3.80 from Monday. Dealers said the dollar remained locked into a fairly narrow trading range in anticipation of new data that should shed more light on the economy and the short-term outlook for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. The government is scheduled to release reports on industrial activity and housing starts for July on Wednesday, merchandise trade in June on Thursday, and the consumer price index on Friday. Some economists are predicting those reports will show continued economic growth, lessening the possibility of lower interest rates. The dollar has been boosted in recent days on speculation that interest rates wo n't fall any time soon. When rates remain firm, dollar-denominated securities, such as bonds, become more attractive to foreigners, and that increases the need for those investors to exchange their currencies for dollars. The dollar headed higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, although trading was subdued Tuesday due to the closing of markets in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> in observance of the Assumption Day religous holiday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose for the fourth consecutive trading day to 142.20 Japanese yen from 141.93 yen. It traded at 142.30 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and at 142.15 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 141.925 Monday. The British pound weakened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, falling to $ 1.5735 from $ 1.5840 late Monday. Sterling fetched $ 1.5768 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.5770. Other dollar rates at Tuesday's close compared with late Monday, included: 1.9437 West German marks, down from 1.9485; 1.6748 Swiss francs, down from 1.6805; 1.18025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17955; 6.5675 French francs, down from 6.5780; and 1,395.50 Italian lire, down from 1,399.00. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Monday: 1.9500 West German marks, up from 1.9395; 1.6790 Swiss francs, up from 1.6760; 6.5835 French francs, up from 6.5535; 2.1905 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1832; and 1.1822 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1775. Gold gained in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 365.75 an ounce, up from $ 364.00 bid Monday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold jumped to $ 366.25 an ounce from $ 363.50. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.42 to $ 365.72 an ounce. Silver prices rose. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $ 5.242 a troy ounce from $ 5.195 late Monday. Silver settled at $ 5.24 an ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from $ 5.21.

<HEAD>Deteriorated Soybean and Corn Crop Boosts Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices rose Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on reports of deteriorating crop conditions. On other markets, copper futures continued to rally, energy issues were up, precious metals prices climbed, livestock were down and pork futures prices were mixed. Wheat settled 2 cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.99 \ a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.34 \ a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents to 4 cents higher with September at $ 1.39 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 11 cents to 20 cents higher with August at $ 6.22 -LCB- Analysts say Monday's crop ratings from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> showed a decline in the condition of the soybean crop _ particularly in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ due to a lack of moisture. `` There was also a strike overnight in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` While it did not affect Brazilian soybean shipments, the psychology of that did n't hurt the beans.'' Soybean prices were also supported by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-day forecast _ released Monday _ which calls for below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures. Corn futures were boosted by the announcement that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would be in the market for 400,000 metric tons of corn and rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also will enter the market. Wheat futures were helped by light commercial purchases by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and carryover from the other pits, <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said. Copper continued its climb on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, amid fears of a shortage in supplies. In addition to a strike that has idled <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s copper mines, the strike at <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> copper mine in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> continues, as does the shutdown of mines in <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, due to landowner terrorism. `` There is some speculative buying as the demand numbers out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are strong,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Rumors of a strike in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also boosted copper prices. Copper was 1.25 cents to 1.50 cents higher with August at $ 1.218 a pound. Bargain hunting pushed precious metals futures up on the Comex, <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said. The climb in prices were due to a weaker dollar resulting from intervention by the central banks of several major industrial nations. Gold was $ 3.60 to $ 4.30 higher with August at $ 370.70 a troy ounce; silver was 4.7 cents to 5 cents higher with August at $ 5.242 a troy ounce. Energy futures were up in lifeless trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market is looking for something to shake it out of its lethargy,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an analyst with E.D. & amp; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It does n't appear as though there is anything on the horizon that will do that.'' West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 10 cents higher with September at $ 18.68 a barrel; heating oil was .02 cent to .24 cent higher with September at 50.28 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .03 cent lower to .20 cent higher with September at 52.06 a gallon. Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures were pressured by commercial selling and anticipation of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s cattle-on-feed report. Analysts say the report, due out Thursday, is expected to show lighter placements in feed and heavier marketings than last year. Pork futures were pressured by increased hog receipts and falling cash prices. Live cattle were .05 cent to .45 cent lower with August at 74.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .90 cent lower with August at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .35 cent lower with August at 46.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent lower to .12 cent higher with August at 24.87 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Chrysler Tentatively Plans 5 Percent Average Price Hike For 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tentatively plans to boost prices of its 1990 model cars by an average 5 percent, the automaker said Tuesday, and blames much of the rise on the cost of federally-mandated passenger restraints such as air bags. Price hikes outlined by the nation's third-largest automaker would boost the price of a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> LeBaron coupe by 8.7 percent to $ 12,495 and of a subcompact <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> by 6.07 percent to $ 6,995, for example. The federal government is requiring that all cars made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after Sept. 1 have driver-side air bags or automatic seat belts as standard equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said they will install air bags on about 1 million cars each during the 1990 model year and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it will have the devices on about half as many. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced a tentative 3.4 percent increase in its 1990 car prices, nearly 1 percent of it blamed on air bags. Ford Division General Manager <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said earlier this month that his company will boost car prices about 4.8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said Tuesday that air bags will add about $ 450 to the price of each U.S.-made <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> car, although that's less than the automaker actually is spending on buying and installing the devices. She declined to say exactly how much the company is spending on air bags. The rest of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s price increase stems from economic reasons, including higher material and labor costs, she said. Those figures are a bit lower than some analysts expected and may not include much padding for buyer incentives that can be factored into any car-buying deal. There has been speculation that the Big Three are eager to get out of the incentive war they have been in since early April. Incentives have cost the companies hundreds of dollars per car in recent months, cutting directly into profits. But a unilateral withdrawal from the rebate war may be tough, and consumers have grown accustomed to dealer offers of rebates and cut-rate financing. `` They're filing for pretty big price increases,'' said analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But whether they will be real world or just on paper to be superseded with rebates is a good question.'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said he may have the answer: `` I think they will wait for about 15 minutes, see that -LRB- 1990 -RRB- sales are slow and come out with rebates.'' Firm retail prices will be announced during the next few weeks as the automakers introduce their 1990 cars. Although it is nearly certain that most 1990 cars will be more expensive than 1989s, some analysts say the sticker shock could be worse. `` If you look at an air bag cost and assume it's between $ 350 and $ 500,'' said analyst <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, `` the price increases would not appear to be recovering the total costs of air bags and materials.''

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON> announced Tuesday he was resigning from <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, ending a 10-year relationship in which the senior executive helped guide the international expansion of cable television concern. <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON> will become president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> COMSAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based satellite technology company. His departure set off a reorganization at the <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> executive suites. <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> issued a brief statement: `` It is with regret that I have accepted the resignation of TBS Senior Executive Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> has been an integral part of the growth and success of our company over the past decade.'' <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON>'s duties at <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> will be split among several people. Advertising, public relations and research will report to <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> and Turner Sports will report to <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuirk </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION>; and the Goodwill Games, for which <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON> negotiated with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1986, will report to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president for finance and administration. <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 after a 21-year career at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and sits on <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s board of directors. At <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, he was responsible for overseeing the company's ongoing international expansion and its sports operations, which include the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> baseball team and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team. <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON> also was in charge of all TBS sports and non-fiction programming. His resignation comes at a time when the company is riding high, having just reported its first quarterly profit in three years. The Cable News Network has recently signed an agreement to use a Soviet satellite, allowing its signal to virtually cover the world. The 1980s have seen TBS grow from a station known mostly for its programming of reruns and <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> games to a media power that includes <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, Headline News, the new TNT network and the MGM film library. <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday that TBS has great potential for more growth. `` I leave with great sadness. I've seen TBS grow from a couple of hundred people to 4,500 -LRB- employees -RRB-,'' he said. `` TBS is a wonderful corporation. There's no upper limit here.'' But he said he was ready for new challenges. <ORGANIZATION> COMSAT </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` asked me to come in and explore what expansion in software there can be in the'90s. There's going to be dramatic changes in how we watch television and purchase equipment.'' <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON>'s interest in satellite technology dates back to the early 1960s, when he was involved in the expansion of satellite and minicam usage at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wussler </PERSON> said he would begin the new job in early September, and that it would probably take until then to wrap his business up at <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Car, Truck Sales Up 8.2 Percent In Early August</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of cars and light trucks rose 8.2 percent in early August compared with last year, partly because of buying by consumers seeking to avoid price increases for 1990 cars, the companies reported Tuesday. Vehicles assembled by the eight major automakers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sold at an average daily rate of 33,660 during the Aug. 1-10 period this year, compared with a rate of 31,118 during the same time last year. Car sales rose 7.4 percent and truck sales were up 9.4 percent from the year-earlier period. In the last two seeks, the Big Three automakers have outlined tentative price hikes for cars in the model year that generally begins in October. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its tentative prices will be about 3.4 percent above 1989 levels, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its prices will be about 4.8 percent higher and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 prices will be about 5 percent up from 1989. The companies said some of the increases are due to costs stemming from governmental requirements that they install passive restraint systems _ air bags or automatic seat belts _ in 1990 model cars. Some consumers may be pushing their 1990 car buying plans up a few months to miss the price boosts. `` I think in all probability there are people buying a little earlier than usual, but not many,'' said analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said the picture would become a clearer later in the month as more sales reports are issued. Consumers also were lured by incentives, which automakers would like to drop during the coming model year. `` Car sales are a little stronger than I expected,'' said analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I would say it is the attractive rebates on the' 89s and the fear of costs of air bags. For Jan. 1 through Aug. 10, car and truck sales were 3.6 percent behind last year's pace, falling to an average daily rate of 38,063 this year from a rate of 39,500 last year. Car sales were off 4.8 percent and truck sales were down 1.5 percent during the period. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> car sales during the 10-day August period dropped 2.7 percent to a daily rate of 9,368 this year from 9,631 a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s sales for the year to date were 8.6 percent behind last year's pace <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales in early August were up 9.2 percent and for the year to date were 2.2 percent behind last year's pace. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s early August car sales rose to a rate of 6,826 a day, 17.6 percent up from a rate of 5,804 in the year-earlier period. For the year-to-date period, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 1.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> truck sales in early August were up 5.1 percent over last year. For the year through Aug. 10, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales were down 2.8 percent from last year's pace. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s early August car sales rose 5.6 percent to a daily rate of 2,835 this year from 2,685 daily a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales for the year to date were 14.1 percent behind last year's Truck sales were up 16.8 percent in early August for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, while falling 0.2 percent from a year earlier for the Jan. 1-Aug. 10 period

<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government said Tuesday it is embarking on a program to attract foreign investments now that an agreement has been reached to disband the U.S.-backed rebels. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, director of foreign investment, said the government had begun a publicity campaign designed `` to be an aggressive policy to attract foreign capital.'' He said companies in other Latin American countries, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and various European countries had expressed interest. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said the campaign would emphasize the foreign-investment law enacted in November 1987, which allows total or partial repatriation of profits to other countries, depending on the industry. Foreign capital also can form joint ventures with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s public or private sectors The leftist government seeks foreign capital in several areas, particularly agriculture. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said 36 foreign companies operate in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, among them <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION>, whose parent company is <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, operates the country's only oil refinery A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic embargo virtually ended the flow of investment capital from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and, with the rebel warfare, helped create hyperinflation and severe unemployment. Inflation was estimated at 20,000 percent last year, but by July the rate had slowed to 8.5 percent a month. Official figures put the unemployment rate at 25 percent of the 1 million-member labor force. On Aug. 7, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and four other <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents agreed that the rebels, known as Contras, should be disbanded. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said Monday he was convinced <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had established democratic conditions that would allow the Contras to return to their homeland. Most of the Contras are in bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 The stock market finished slightly higher Tuesday after struggling through a featureless session. `` It was a yawning affair,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON>, a technical analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> investment firm. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.86 points to close at 2,687.78. The Dow Jones average had declined a total of 34.71 points in the previous two sessions, retreating from near-record highs. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 809 issues up, 689 down and 501 unchanged.

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 179.425 million shares. The market zigzagged through most of the session. Analysts said there was some profit-taking but overall little selling pressure as many participants withdrew from the market to await more information on the economy. `` The market is looking for new impetus,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, technical analyst with <PERSON> Janney </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` The market vacillations seem to suggest that traders are looking for a new comfort level at which to buy.''

 Oil futures prices finished mostly higher Tuesday in continued dull trading, buoyed mainly by technical market factors, traders said. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the September-delivery contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, closed 10 cents higher at $ 18.68 per 42-gallon barrel. Contract months for later delivery posted smaller advances. Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded regular gasoline for September delivery slipped 0.3 cent to 52.06 cents a gallon. Most contracts for later delivery rose, however. Heating oil futures, which led the market higher last week, posted moderate gains. The September contract jumped 0.24 cent to finish at 50.28 cents a gallon. `` It's been very, very quiet in the market,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The market gained some momentum when the September crude contract hit the $ 18.50-per-barrel level, but other than that technical factor there was little to move prices, he said. The oil market has been in the summer doldrums for some time. Traders are looking forward to Labor Day for a pickup in activity and beyond that to the next scheduled meeting, on Sept. 23, of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

 <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, elated over his pardon by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a Watergate-era crime, won a 13-year battle to clear his name with the same persistence and political savvy that made him a multibillionaire industrialist and intimate of world leaders. Hammer, 91, said on Monday he had been pardoned for making illegal contributions to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s re-election campaign in 1972. Hammer had pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976, and was sentenced to one year's probation and fined $ 3,000. White House officials confirmed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had pardoned Hammer and nine other unidentified people on Monday, but refused to give details. Repeated efforts to reach presidential counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> were unsuccessful Tuesday. `` Having spent my lifetime fighting injustice, this vindication reinforces my abiding faith in the American system of justice,'' <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said in a statement from his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> home. `` I deeply appreciate President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action in clearing my name.'' A spokesmen said Tuesday that Hammer, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would have no further comment. Hammer spent several years seeking a pardon. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is known to have considered granting Hammer's wish before he left office last January, but nothing came of it. `` I'm pleading -LRB- guilty -RRB- because I'm guilty,'' Hammer had declared in federal court in 1976. But Hammer had blamed former Gov. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a former vice president of an <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, through whom the $ 54,000 in illegal payments were made. Hammer argued that he funneled the money through <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> to maintain anonymity, but that <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> did not deliver the funds until after a new federal law went into effect in April 1972 which prohibited making campaign contributions in someone else's name. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $ 1,000 for concealing the identity of Hammer as the actual donor. A federal judge later set aside <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON>'s prison term, partly because <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> was given probation instead of a prison term because of his age and poor health. Leaving his hospital bed as a heart patient for sentencing 13 years ago, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> expressed regret over the first crime he had ever committed. He told the judge that `` I trust, in the time that may be left me, your honor will allow me to continue being a useful member of society.'' Since his brush with the law, Hammer has circled the globe in his specially outfitted <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 hobnobbing with presidents, kings and prime ministers, pushing for U.S.-Soviet summit talks, providing aid to earthquake victims, giving away chunks of his vast art collection and trying to raise $ 1 billion to find a cure for cancer. `` I've had two dreams, two ambitions in life, and I hope to accomplish both of them,'' he once said. They are peace between East and West and a cure for cancer. All the while, Hammer has guided <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s growth from a struggling oil company worth $ 34,000 in 1956, when he made his first investment, into a colossus of oil, chemicals, coal and foods with a book value of more than $ 6 billion. His pardon was not universally applauded, however. A group called the Friends of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> decried the pardon for the man they said `` has been trying to encourage communist expansion through his open business dealings with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The group called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` muster the courage'' to pardon <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide convicted of charges in the Iran-Contra affair. Born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as the grandson of a Russian Jewish immigrant, Hammer became a millionaire while still studying at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, when he took over his physician father's faltering pharmaceutical business and turned it into a money-maker. At 23, he was fresh out of medical school but unwilling to wait six months to begin his internship at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. So in 1921, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> made his first trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help alleviate a typhus epidemic. Once there, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> decided the Russian people needed food more than medical assistance. He quickly announced a deal that brought a shipload of surplus American wheat valued at $ 1 million in return for <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> furs, hides and caviar. That deal caught the attention of V.I. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, the first of many Soviet leaders Hammer has known. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> encouraged the young American entrepreneur to take over an abandoned asbestos mine near western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, the first Soviet concession ever granted to a foreigner. Hammer developed the mine into a profitable enterprise, and soon obtained sales concessions for such leading American firms as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rubber, <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> Typewriter. He also opened the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first pencil factory, which posted $ 1 million in profits in the first year. Hammer left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1930, taking his profits in the form of paintings, tapestries, silver and jewels, which formed the start of his multimillion-dollar art collection. He owns two art galleries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. During the 1940s, Hammer netted a $ 7.5 million profit from a $ 100,000 investment by developing a way to turn surplus potato crops into commercial alcohol and marketing a blended whiskey under his own label. He accumulated seven distilleries and later sold his entire whiskey interests to the Schenley group. He also made fortunes in livestock feed and cattle, and held the nation's first million-dollar purebred <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> cattle sale. Even today, he is reaping fat profits from a $ 20 billion chemical fertilizer deal with the Soviets, and has joint coal mining and phosphoric acid ventures under way in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Commenting on his reputation as a worldwide wheeler-dealer, Hammer once said: `` I am first a catalyst. I bring people and situations together. That's the big thing _ bringing the deal together.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary overcharged the government by $ 5.9 million on five computer projects between 1983 and 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee said Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, released a report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional auditing agency, detailing the overcharges by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Like <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said he was asking the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to seek recovery of the Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on the report. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> also said he received a related but separate report from the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday suggesting that the Software Productivity Consortium, a group of 14 of the nation's leading defense firms established to develop tools and techniques to improve the productivity of military software, may have overcharged the government by $ 22.5 million for their participation in the consortium. In both cases, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said, the improper charges stemmed from misclassification of projects as `` manufacturing and production engineering,'' a category of expense for which contractors can be fully reimbursed by the government. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, however, concluded that both <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the Software Productivity Consortium should have classified their activities as `` independent research and development'' expenditures, a classification of expenses for which the government contribution is limited. `` In this era of $ 300-billion military budgets and half-billion-dollar airplanes, $ 6 million may not seem like much, but that money could give 2,225 youngsters a chance in life by putting them through one year of Head Start,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said in a statement.

<TEXT>
 The stock price for <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> surged Tuesday after a bidder pursuing the equipment leasing and shipping concern raised its unsolicited takeover offer by about $ 200 million to more than $ 1 billion. The bidder is <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a company jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION> Stena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, a Swedish shipping concern, and <ORGANIZATION> Tiphook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British concern that provides containers to the shipping industry. Temple said it was raising its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION>' common stock to $ 63 a share from $ 50 a share and boosted its offer for the company's convertible preferred shares to $ 101.43 a share from $ 80.50 a share The offer values <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> at about $ 1.02 billion, up from $ 824 million under the previous offer was launched May 26. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.12 -LCB- a share to $ 67.12 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> had said last week that it was considering recapitalizing as an alternative to the original takeover offer. The company, which is based in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, and its New York-based public relations firm could not be reached after business hours for comment on the higher offer. The three companies reportedly met Aug. 3 to discuss the possibility of a sale of certain assets of <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION>' ferry services and container businesses to <ORGANIZATION> Stena </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tiphook </ORGANIZATION>. Subsequently, <ORGANIZATION> Stena </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tiphook </ORGANIZATION> said they may sell all or part of their 8 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION>. Temple extended the expiration date of the latest tender offer to Aug. 28. It said that under terms of its original offer, which was to have expired Monday, approximately 103,500 shares of common stock had been tendered.

 A Canadian partnership removed some conditions Tuesday on its $ 296 million hostile bid for <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts and said it would raise the offer to $ 308 million if it wins a lawsuit challenging the doughnut shop chain's anti-takeover measures. <ORGANIZATION> DD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership of <ORGANIZATION> Kingsbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said it would raise its price to $ 45 a share, from $ 43, if <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> orders <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts to rescind its employee stock ownership plan and other defenses. The Toronto-based partnership's offer originally was conditioned on obtaining 75 percent of the doughnut company's shares. That offer, which was set to expire at midnight Tuesday, was extended until Sept. 15 and is now conditioned on obtaining just 50.1 percent, or a bare majority, of the shares. `` What we are saying by dropping the minimum number of shares is that we're prepared to buy a voting control position and hang around until we get actual control, which could take a couple of years,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts, which is based in suburban <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, had no immediate response to the revised offer. The reaction on Wall Street was lukewarm; <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts shares rose 37 -LCB- cents to close at $ 37.87 -LCB- in over-the-counter trading Tuesday. <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION>, the merchant banking arm of investor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, offered a friendly merger with <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts at $ 42 a share in May When it was rebuffed, it joined with <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>, the parent company of two <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> restaurant chains, to launch the $ 43-a-share hostile offer. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts has set up a series of tough defenses, including the employee stock ownership plan, which holds about 16 percent of its outstanding common shares. It also has a shareholder rights plan, or `` poison pill,'' designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a takeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive. And it has sold $ 28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an 11 percent stake in the company, to an avowedly friendly investor, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> have filed suit in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> charging that the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> and preferred stock sale were improperly put in place solely to prevent a takeover The Canadian partners also have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to order <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts to remove its poison pill. Last week, the court refused to grant the partnership a preliminary injunction against the takeover defenses. The case has not yet been scheduled to be heard on its merits.

<TEXT>
 The government has announced new rules allowing foreign investment in the nationalized petroleum industry, hoping to attract $ 8 billion over the next five years and modernize the industry. `` This is the first time we have defined clearly what foreign investment is allowed in petrochemical products,'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference Tuesday. The commission has ruled that 15 oil-based products are now open to 40 percent private investment by foreign and domestic interests, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> said. Those products were formerly reserved exclusively for the national oil company <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>. The new rules also allow about 350 tertiary petrochemical products to be manufactured with 100 percent private investment. These include about 100 plastics products. Loosening <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>'s grip on petroleum by-products follows a May announcement that the government was allowing greater foreign ownership in Mexican companies. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s administration has been striving to increase foreign investment and make the notoriously ineffectual oil industry more efficient and less corrupt. `` It's important for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to be integrated in world commerce and that we modernize technology,'' <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> said. The Mexican Constitution reserves primary petrochemical product manufacture to the government; only secondary and tertiary products come under the new ruling. The Energy, Mines and <ORGANIZATION> Parastate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> projects <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> investments of $ 1.5 billion through 1995. The government expects to attract an additional $ 8 billion from foreign and domestic private investors, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> said. Foreign companies that have shown an interest in investing include <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, he added. The government hopes to increase petrochemical exports and decrease imports under the new scheme, he said. Investment of 40 percent will be allowed in producing vinyl acetate, acetone, acrylic acid, anhydrous acid, chlorobenzenes, ammonium phosphate, isoprene, isopropanal, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, polypropylenes and urea. These are all secondary products. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> will maintain exclusive control over 20 primary petrochemical products derived from the first refinement of crude oil. They include benzene, ethanol, methanol, propylene, N-paraffins and toluene.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, at the center of a federal investigation into allegedly fraudulent futures trading practices, on Tuesday created a permanent panel to monitor the integrity of the marketplace. The Committee on Ethics and Integrity will examine all aspects of exchange trading practices `` to ensure the utmost of integrity and ethical conduct,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. It said the committee was created by the unanimous vote of the exchange's board of directors. In addition to creating the committee, the board also added its fourth director who is not a member of the exchange. This will bring the board's membership to 25. `` Integrity is the No. 1 priority of this exchange,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>. `` We feel that the addition of another non-member director and the establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> is a natural outgrowth of this commitment.'' A federal grand jury has indicted 46 traders at the Board of Trade and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, accusing them of cheating their customers.

 The striking <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans for their first contract talks since the walkout began as strikers mourned the death Tuesday of a telephone worker injured on the picket line. But spokesmen for unions striking another of the four so-called `` Baby Bell'' companies, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said bargaining was going slowly. `` I believe this is going to be a long strike,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cremmy </PERSON>, an executive board member of Local 827 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I estimate at least a month, maybe longer.'' Nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, technicians and other workers are on strike against the four regional telephone companies in 20 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Only <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> had official contract talks in progress Tuesday. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> refused to disclose any details of the negotiations. No other talks were announced. Most customers have noticed the strike only through delays in services such as directory assistance, but strikers said a few thunderstorms knocking down telephone lines could put the companies in trouble. A <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, reported five cases of sabotage Tuesday. Lines were cut some time during the morning by axes and hacksaws, causing about 2,000 customers in four towns to lose service. Service was expected to be restored by mid-evening, officials said. The companies affected are: _ New York-based <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which serves about 50 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, a small part of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the five other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states Its companies have 60,000 workers on strike. Some 10.3 million customers are affected. _ Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, which has subsidiaries serving 12.7 million customers in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> It has 52,000 workers on strike. _ San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, whose two subsidiaries serve 13.2 million customers in parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> More than 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> members are striking. _ Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which owns companies serving 12 million customers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> It has 35,000 employees belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> on strike. An additional 12,500 employees, members of the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION>, have ratified agreements with the companies. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> announced informal contract talks for Wednesday after company president <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> appealed for calm. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>'s appeal came one day after cable splicer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, 34, was fatally injured when he mounted the hood of a car driven by a non-striking telephone employee on the service road of a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> facility in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> pounded on the windshield, but slid off and hit his head on the pavement, police said. The union disputed that, saying he fell onto the hood and the 18-year-old driver accelerated. No charges were filed. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> died of head injuries at 1:15 p.m. Tuesday, said union spokeswoman <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> said he had called <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> with his concerns, `` and he and I agreed the best way of approaching it is to try and calm the waters and try and find a way back to the negotiating table.'' In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, however, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the telephone company was negotiating at a snail's pace. `` Yesterday, the company got back to our proposal of four days ago,'' union spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlacter </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They offered shallow changes,'' <PERSON> Schlacter </PERSON> said. `` Our union was all over them because they took four days to make these small changes. We are still far apart on major issues.'' Informal negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> occurred in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday and further talks are expected Wednesday, company spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Plumb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the company was waiting for the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> to respond to its latest offer. Three other companies have reached settlements with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION>. They are Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>, Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was repairing damage by vandals that had left 8,000 customers without operator service or an emergency 911 connection in <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> counties. Also, two union members striking the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were charged with harassment in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after a company manager complained they followed his service truck to a job and screamed insults at him. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, more than 700 striking telephone workers staged a noisy rally outside <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s state headquarters Tuesday to protest the benefits package offered by the company. `` This strike is not against the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> but against the company that refuses to give benefits,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caggiano </PERSON>, an information operator in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>.
