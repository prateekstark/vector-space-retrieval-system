 Preliminary figures from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s presidential election show the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate winning, but with the lowest margin in its six decades in office <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> figures obtained from a reliable source show <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> with 47.4 percent of the 4.5 million votes counted so far. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was second with 26.7 percent and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> third with 20.7 percent. The 4.5 million votes counted are out of 11.7 million ballots reported so far to the commission. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has 38 million registered voters but no figures are available how many voted in Wednesday's election In addition to the presidency, 64 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and 500 in the newly expanded Chamber of Deputies are at stake. A final vote count is not expected until Sunday. The early leak appeared designed to counter growing speculation that the ruling party, known as the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> for its initials in Spanish, had suffered a devastating loss. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, proclaimed a party victory in at least 27 of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states and said opposition accusations of fraud were meant to confuse the electorate. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> is going to defend its legal and unobjectionable electoral triumph with all the means of the law. It is going to mobilize the force of all its organizations to combat the provocation and irresponsibility'' of the opposition, he said. A relaxed and smiling <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, meeting Friday night with foreign reporters, insisted that he was more concerned that the vote count be credible than with his margin of victory. `` Those results reflect real votes,'' he said. `` The results so far ratify this circumstance of plurality ... and a new political reality in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' He said opposition parties will be most visible in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, where presumably would have a role in approving or blocking constitutional changes that require a two-thirds majority. At a news conference earlier Friday, <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> accused the government of delaying an announcement in order to falsify results. `` They are waiting to see how to disguise the figures,'' he said. `` I believe we won, but I do n't want to boast prematurely as my adversary has,'' he said of the victory claim by <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has changed. Totally changed. ... We will never have only one party again.'' <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> met earlier in the day and agreed to share their information on voting results in order to challenge government figures. He said they also agreed not to release figures publicly for the time being, because when the government finds out what information the opposition has, then officials will know which results they can `` dress up.'' No PRI presidential candidate since the party's founding in 1929 has won less than 70 percent of the vote. The slow count also is making evident splits within the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> between the 40-year-old <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and the old-style politicians. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the vote count, is headed by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, who was among <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s chief rivals for the presidential nomination. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> has insisted throughout the campaign that he will introduce a new era in which opposition voices will be heard. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> governor in the central state of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> until his break with the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> last year, waged an unusually strong campaign that capitalized on widespread discontent with the hardships caused by six years of economic crisis. The leftist candidate is the son of the revered late President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. In renouncing his own presidential hopes and endorsing <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> last spring, <PERSON> Heberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> described the <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> movement as a `` phenomenon.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> appeared ready to concede losses to <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, the central state of <LOCATION> Morelos </LOCATION> and in the Federal District, the core of the sprawling <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> metropolitan area. A fourth <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> victory could come in the populous state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which abuts the Federal District on three sides. The vote count made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> also showed <PERSON> Gumersino </PERSON> <PERSON> Magana </PERSON> <PERSON> Negrete </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with 0.95 percent of the vote and <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> of the radical <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with 0.4 percent. Most districts recorded so far are urban, where <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> are strongest. The Salinas de Gortari percentage could be expected to rise slightly with reports from rural district where the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> is traditionally strong. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said soon after the election that technical difficulties with a new computer system delayed the returns. He later blamed bad weather. The government says the elections were peaceful and clean. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials have said charges by opposition parties that the balloting was fraudulent were a publicity move. The Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a civic watchdog group, recorded 1,100 cases of voting irregularities ranging from ballot-stuffing to tampering with voter registration rolls.

<HEAD>Aegis System Got Poor Marks In GAO Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Aegis air defense system, used by the cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> last week to track and shoot down an Iranian passenger jet, may not have been adequately tested before it was deployed, according to a classified review by a congressional watchdog agency. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study concluded that the $ 1 billion system has not proven its ability to discriminate among targets, said congressional sources who have seen the document. They spoke Friday on condition they not be named. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> review started last year and did not mention last week's destruction of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight 655 that killed all 290 people aboard The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired at the airliner after mistaking it for an Iranian F-14. Pentagon officials have said the Aegis system was not malfunctioning. A `` minor degradation'' of the Aegis radar was repaired before the ship entered the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last month, they said. Aegis, named for the shield of Zeus in Greek mythology, is a complex mix of radars and computers. It was developed as the main component of protection for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> surface ships against enemy ships and planes. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is building a fleet of Aegis cruisers, of which the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is the third. The service is also using some components of the Aegis system aboard other surface ships. The system was first deployed in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> review looked at the Aegis testing program before the system went into service, said the sources. The study criticized a series of 1984 tests in which the Aegis system tracked 11 targets and guided the firing of weapons which hit 10, the sources said. At one point, two targets were fired upon at the same time. The 1984 test program was set up specifically to answer complaints from <PERSON> Aegis </PERSON> critics who argued that the system needed more realistic tests. But the tests were set up so carefully they did not approximate a `` real-life'' combat environment, the sources quoted the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report as saying. In other developments Friday: _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the issue of whether to pay compensation for the families of those killed is `` under consideration. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there were `` still some open questions'' on the issue. _ Sen <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should adopt a new stance in the Iran-Iraq war `` equidistant'' from the two warring countries `` I do believe that we'd be much better served in trying to end the war if we were really in a position of condemning both attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and also condemning the chemical warfare being conducted against innocent people by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' he said. _ Pentagon officials said they are awaiting results of an investigation to learn why the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> missed air traffic communications and other clues indicating that the jet was a civilian plane and not an F-14 fighter, as officers aboard the ship believed Iranian officials have said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> systems should have been able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in English between the jetliner and the airport control tower in <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. But Pentagon spokesmen said they were not sure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were monitoring, or were able to monitor, air traffic control communications at the time of the incident. `` We are looking forward to an analysis of the tapes to help clarify the issue,' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

<HEAD>Order Could Hinder Prosecution On Main Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge's order giving <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> broader access to secret government documents for his defense strongly raises the possibility he wo n't be tried on the main charges of the Iran-Contra indictment. But the order issued Friday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> clears the way for the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to go to trial at least on charges he lied to cover up his activities and personally gained from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. The judge's order scheduling the trial for Sept. 20 set the stage for the proceeding to take place in the middle of the fall presidential campaign. In addition to fixing the trial date, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> North </PERSON> is entitled to use highly classified documents that might show the covert activities that are the basis of the Iran-Contra conspiracy charge were authorized by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The judge noted that some highly sensitive portions of documents in the prosecution's case that government security experts want deleted `` tended to exonerate North of guilt on certain charges.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled <PERSON> North </PERSON> was entitled to cite these passages in a public trial. If the government continues to object, those charges could be dismissed under the Classified Information Procedures Act, known as <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION>. The judge further ordered that independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and the government must provide <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> with such highly secret documents as references in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s daily intelligence briefings to covert aid to the Contras. The fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide is charged along with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> with conspiring to defraud the government by illegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. All four defendants, ordered by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to be tried separately, are also charged with theft of government property and wire fraud. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contends that the defendants corrupted the legitimate, fully authorized presidential initiative of trading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms for American hostages by funneling weapons-sale proceeds to the Contras. According to court pleadings by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, some of the documents sought are so sensitive that only the president and a handful of top officials have access to them. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he was not endorsing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense or even the admissibility of the documents as evidence. But he said the material should be made available to the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel `` to assure that the truth, whatever it ultimately proves to be, ` will out.''' The judge gave North until Aug. 1 to notify the government of his intention to use classified portions of the documents he already has as evidence. He set an Aug. 15 deadline for North to file a similar list of material turned over as a result of Friday's order `` A jury trial on those counts remaining after the <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> process takes it course is set for Sept. 20,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` It presently appears that, at a minimum, substantive charges of cover-up, falsification and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s alleged receipt of personal benefit derived from his conduct as a government employee can proceed to trial,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. In a brief statement, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said: `` We are ready to proceed as directed by the court.'' Even if the three major counts are dismissed, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> is charged with 12 other felony counts, including allegations that he: _ lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 about covert administration aid to the Contras _ shredded documents during Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s November 1986 investigation of the Iran-Contra affair _ created phony documents to obstruct an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the construction of a $ 15,000 security fence around his home _ accepted the fence as an illegal gratuity from <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. _ pocketed $ 4,300 worth of traveler's checks from $ 90,000 given to him by a Contra leader to defray expenses for helping the rebel cause.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is defending its chairman against congressional allegations that he improperly used government funds for presidential politics, personal business and to help destroy the agency.

Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on courts, civil liberties and the administration of justice, agreed that the evidence appears to show `` significant improprieties in the financial management of the corporation. `` It's very unlikely that -LRB- <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> -RRB- could explain these matters satisfactorily,'' he said. <PERSON> Durant </PERSON>, reached by telephone at his <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> law office, denied the allegations and countered that the congressional attack was motivated by political and policy disagreements over the direction of the agency, which funds legal assistance programs for the poor. The corporation said that it discovered during its examination of the records that `` Mr. <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> is entitled to approximately $ 8,800 in attendance fees, which he has not claimed.'' The agency said it was continuing to review records at the subcommittee's request The agency said the congressional investigation `` is being used by some in an attempt to derail needed reforms in the delivery of government-funded legal services to the poor and to discredit the efforts of Chairman <PERSON> Durant </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said a preliminary congressional investigation of corporation records covering an 18-month period revealed that <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> telephone credit cards to call <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> headquarters nine times and may have charged campaign-tied trips to the agency. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said there were 23 trips to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> charged to the agency that have no documentation tying them to Legal Services work. <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> also charged to the agency long-distance phone calls to high-ranking federal transportation officials, an apparent link to his private sector post as a railroad trustee, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> alleged. And the congressman said <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> is `` the man behind'' the agency's controversial move to hire lobbyists who were instructed to urge lawmakers to cut the Legal Services budget. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said last month that federal law prohibits such lobbying. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> added that documents provided by <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> at the subcommittee's request showed dozens of calls to private, conservative organizations that have advocated the abolition of Legal Services, including the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Dismantling Legal Services was an early goal of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who appointed <PERSON> Durant </PERSON>, and the chairman has been a leading critic of his own agency. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who headed a Legal Services program in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, before his election to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, estimated the cost of `` questionable'' telephone calls at more than $ 5,000 plus thousands more in air travel. <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> scoffed at the allegations. `` This is purely rooted in policy and political differences,'' he said. `` I do n't have anything to hide ...,'' he said. `` If there are any calls that are not strictly related to Legal Services, I have no objection and think the corporation should be reimbursed.'' But he said those would not come close to the dollar estimates provided by <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> said he knew of $ 2.35 in telephone calls that were mistakenly charged to the agency, and he said he knew of no travel expenses. The decision to hire the lobbyists was made by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, then president of <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> said. But the congressmen said <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> was behind the move to hire the lobbyists and then orchestrated a move to force <PERSON> Bayly </PERSON> out of his job.

<HEAD>`Visitor' Amendment Passed by House of Bishops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s policy making bodies Friday approved a resolution to let the presiding bishop name a man to perform some sacramental acts for members who object to having a female bishop. Approval of the measure was in doubt briefly Friday after a minor amendment was tacked onto it by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>, one of two bodies meeting at the church's 69th General Convention here through Monday. But the House of Bishops, the church's other legislative body, concurred later Friday. While some at the meeting saw the resolution as watering down a 1976 decision approving the ordination of women, it sets a six-year time limit on the authority to name a `` visitor,'' as the man would be called. The resolution was approved 122-94 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> and 140-28 in the House of Bishops. There are no women yet serving as bishops in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, but about 900 female priests have been ordained. `` I'm sorry that the statement was accepted. I'm glad there is a time limit, I can live with it,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, a female priest from southern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, a lay member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> said the time limit `` undermines the Episcopate in the long run. I feel that a woman bishop would hasten the day of understanding.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> of the east <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> diocese backed the proposal and its limit. `` I think the death of a belief is as painful as the death of a relationship,'' he said. `` There is a belief system dying. We need to be concerned during grieving process and reach out as often as we can.'' Also on Friday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution in response to a call by Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> to boycott American companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> The resolution goes to the House of Delegates. _ The House of Bishops unanimously approved an economic development package that passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and calls for $ 250,000 from the church over the next three years to create community land trust, cooperative housing, employee-owned businesses, and community credit unions

 <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> says his sensitivity to alcohol abuse tempered his portrayal of the lovable lush `` Arthur'' in the sequel `` Arthur 2 On The Rocks.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who won an Oscar nomination for his performance as the drunken millionaire <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>, said his approach to the character this time was different because of a heightened awareness of alcoholism. `` There was no official pressure from the studio or from any organized groups,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said recently. `` But I personally have an educated awareness of the problem.'' The producers also avoided any scenes in `` Arthur 2 On The Rocks'' of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> drinking and driving, unlike the original, in which <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> is seen cruising in his Rolls Royce swigging from a bottle. `` There's a scene in which <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> -RRB- says she never lets him drink and drive,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` And you can tell that <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> knows exactly what he should or should not do. He still gets very drunk, but that's because he feels panicked and isolated sometimes and unable to cope with the world.'' But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is quick to point out that the film does n't preach. The sequel opened Friday at theaters nationwide.

 A <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> police officer was killed and three heavily armed <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison escapees were wounded in a gun battle that erupted Friday when the officer stopped to check a suspicious vehicle, a spokesman said. The slain officer was <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, 40, said police spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiracofe </PERSON>. A former reserve officer and probation official, <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> became a full-time member of the department in December 1986. He died Friday morning from two gunshots to the chest, said <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brafford </PERSON>. Four injured people, all occupants of the car <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> had investigated, were arrested after the shooting behind a laundry several miles southwest of downtown. Police said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 33, had gone to the trunk to retrieve identification but instead pulled a pistol from the vehicle and opened fire. The three escapees were wounded by gunfire returned by backup Officer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, a member of the department for less than a year. A fourth occupant of the car, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> woman, also was wounded, apparently by gunfire from one of the other suspects, said <PERSON> Kiracofe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> `` did very well. He emptied his weapon at least once and had to reload under an awful lot of pressure. He fired a lot of rounds'' with a .357 - caliber Magnum service revolver, said The escapees were identified late Friday as <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was serving 25 years for robbery with a deadly weapon and attempted robbery; <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goins </PERSON>, 26, who was serving 12 years for rape, kidnapping and robbery with a deadly weapon; and <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 28, who was serving 45 years for assault with intent to murder. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was treated for a gunshot to the face and then released for police questioning, said <PERSON> Kiracofe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goins </PERSON> was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head, said <PERSON> Brafford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kiracofe </PERSON> said he might survive but would have brain damage. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> was listed in stable condition with a gunshot to the thigh at <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Memorial. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 39, a longtime acquaintance of <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, was in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudderman </PERSON>, assistant hospital administrator.

 Sixty-four men survived the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> oil rig fire by leaping into the burning sea in the dark, but they had to leave behind more than 100 colleagues trapped and screaming for air in the inferno. `` I am one of the lucky ones,'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said in an interview Friday. `` I am pretty sore, I am badly bruised and my hands are burned. But at least I'm alive. I have lost a lot of friends.'' Seventeen bodies have been found and 166 men are presumed dead in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil field where the rig exploded Wednesday night. At least 100 men died screaming for help, trapped in their sleeping quarters after surviving the first explosion, said <PERSON> Calder </PERSON>, a 35-year-old helicopter landing officer. The workers were in the smoke-filled galley of the platform, which was plunged into darkness when the emergency lighting failed, he said in an interview Friday. `` Windows and the emergency door were cracking under the intense heat. There must have been at least 100 men in there,'' <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said. `` Men were shouting into their radios: ` We need breathing apparatus. What's happening? Is there anybody getting out? We are all going to die.' `` It was sheer panic. A lot of guys were lying on the floor, just trying to breathe. We had towels and we were just dipping them in anything to help us breathe,'' he said. <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> and a co-worker got out through a rear door just in time, he said, `` but I do n't think the others made it. I would have perished with them if I had n't got out when I did.'' He said he was asleep when the first explosion ripped through the rig, but he and his colleague had climbed on to the roof of the helicopter deck by the time the second blast hit. They made their way to the pipe deck and lay under a steel table for protection. `` We were hardly getting any breath. It was really bad,'' he said. `` Then, all of a sudden, the floor collapsed and we found ourselves lying at an angle. We saw a clear view looking through the smoke. We said rather than burn, we can get through that and jump. `` We crawled along pipes which were scalding hot. I burned my hands,'' he said. `` We got to the edge of the platform and just jumped. It was well over 100 feet to the sea. I missed the flames in the water. `` I did n't have a life jacket,'' <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said. `` I hit the water and came up and I was OK. I started swimming and kept swimming.'' The two men got clear and <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said he held onto his co-worker's life jacket. `` Then a life jacket appeared on the water in front of me and I put it on. It was a stroke of luck. `` There was debris everywhere and a lot of guys were sitting on pieces of debris. The waves were coming over my head. `` Then I saw a supply boat. It was easily a mile away. I kept swimming and swimming and waving and shouting. I was n't sure whether I had been seen. `` I was sure the skipper had given me a flash with his lights, but the boat seemed to be going away,'' <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said. `` I thought that was going to be it _ that I was going to die. `` Then the boat went into reverse and turned round. It came to me and threw me a lifeline. They pulled me aboard. My friend was picked up by another vessel. I was told later that he was OK.'' Another survivor, 50-year-old <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, said that when he and some others tried to leave the crew's quarters, `` the flames were shooting into the doors ... For about three-quarters of an hour we were sitting inside. Nobody seemed to know what to do.'' Fire spread rapidly, turning metal girders red-hot and bringing decks crashing down in half-molten heaps. The men faced a hard choice: stay aboard and hope aid got to them before the flames, or jump into a sea that was cold enough below the burning oil to kill them. Even on a clear summer night, the water temperature was 57 degrees. Burning oil was spreading across the few bare patches of water remaining and the decision had to be made quickly. `` I decided to get myself out,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` I was n't going to sit down and get burned to death. ... You either stayed where you were and burned to death or you tried to get out.''

 President and military leader <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said a plebiscite to choose the president for 1989-97 will take place within the next 90 days. He is expected to be the only candidate. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> also said Friday he already has a platform for his next presidential term, but he refused to disclose it because the opposition `` would copy it.'' `` The plebiscite is near. There are less than 90 days left,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> told an audience of 16,000 supporters in this southern port city 330 miles from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The 72-year-old army commander has ruled this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation since a 1973 coup. His remark was the most precise indication so far of a date for the ballot. According to the 1980 military-drafted Constitution, the nation's next presiddnt will be picked in a plebiscite in which Chileans will only be able to vote yes or no on a single candidate nominated by the heads of the three armed services and the national police. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself will participate in the nomination as commander-in-chief of the army and is considered the most likely nominee. He is allowed by the Constitution to seek re-election and has clearly indicated he intends to do so. If voters approve the nominee, he will serve for eight years starting in March 1989. If rejected, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will remain in power until 1990, and an open election would take place. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> blasted opposition leaders seeking support from the international community as `` traitors.'' He said some critics who recently were given limited access to television are going too far in their broadscast remarks. `` When those bad Chileans make insults on television, because they know we are in a democracy and we wo n't do anything to them, let's tell them that our patience has limits and that they could soon discover those limits,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> warned. He predicted an overwhelming victory in the upcoming plebiscite and said of his opponents, `` We will wipe them out.''

 Falling water levels on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that have stranded barges are threatening to trigger a regional water fight on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, pitting southern senators and others against Great Lakes lawmakers. On Friday, Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., asked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for an emergency diversion of water from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and 12 other senators urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a letter to direct the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to increase the flow of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> water to the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Waterway </LOCATION> and the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> from 3,000 to 10,000 cubic feet per second for 100 days. The action triggered immediate opposition from several <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> lawmakers led by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who said it would be illegal unless approved by all the Great Lakes governors. And in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, Justice Minister <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hnatyshyn </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotlieb </PERSON>, would deliver a formal notice to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> saying that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is unalterably opposed to any diversion. <PERSON> Hnatyshyn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> can veto any diversion proposal as a result of several treaties. `` We control our resources,'' he said. `` We will continue to control our resources.'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said the drought has pushed water levels on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> three feet lower than they have been since 1872, when officials first began keeping records. As many as 3,000 barges are stranded, with the loss to the barge and towing industry possibly exceeding $ 60 million, he said. `` Communities along the river face the prospects of drinking water shortages and drinking water pollution because of the drought,'' said <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>. He said the diversion would raise the level of the river by one foot in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and six inches in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and only lower the level of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> by one inch. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said the Great Lakes states are hurting as well. He said Great Lakes water levels have fallen two feet in the past 18 months and are likely to continue to fall. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> also said any action to divert the water would be illegal because the 1986 Water Resources Development Act bars diversion unless it is approved by all of the Great Lakes governors. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has set a limit on how much water can be diverted without its permission. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said he believes the president has the authority to take the action as commander in chief in a national emergency. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said corps officials he has talked to do not believe they have the legal authority to take the action or that it would do much good He said they believe that reducing the loads of barges would be more effective. Lake levels have dropped by 30 inches in the past two years, said Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. Added Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., `` Diversion of water from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> may damage navigation, hydroelectric generation and the environment Signing the letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging the diversion were <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss., <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> John </PERSON> Others joining <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> in speaking against the action were Sens. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis

 Firefighters battling a 5-day-old, 16,500-acre blaze near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> National Memorial finally had the weather on their side Friday as they worked to reinforce existing fire lines before digging new ones. Brief late-afternoon thundershowers pelted parts of the fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, including the southwestern side considered the most serious problem area. `` This southern portion of the fire got dumped on pretty good,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>. `` We do n't think the whole fire got rained on.'' Rainfall amounts were not known, but firefighters getting ready to go on the night shift were smiling during a 30-minute thundershower and hail storm. Earlier, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the showers helped lower the temperature and raise the humidity, but also could bring stronger winds and the possibility of lightning. Lightning is believed to have started the fire Monday night in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. It spread Wednesday into the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, site of the memorial to four presidents. Friday afternoon, flames jumped a highway and 30 families were ordered to evacuate. The blaze could be contained by Sunday night if the weather holds, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Homann </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, meanwhile, 32 fires burned, four of which had consumed more than 290,000 acres. Fires also burned on in drought-parched timber and grassland in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> fire threatened <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rushmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> and the town of <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday night, but it stopped short of the tourist stops, both of which had been evacuated. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> were reopened Thursday, but Custer State Park remained off-limits. The fire had burned an estimated 16,500 acres by late Friday. Seventeen miles of fire line had been built and 64 percent of the perimeter had been contained, <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. The cost to fight the fire so far is $ 361,000, and it could cost $ 1 million when all the expenses are tallied, <PERSON> Homann </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a blaze that had come within 10 miles of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pipeline </LOCATION> was held in check for a second day. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s major fires are a 126,000-acre blaze 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Livengood </LOCATION>; a 40,000-acre fire near <LOCATION> Ambler </LOCATION>; a 53,000-acre fire northeast of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION>; and a 51,000-acre fire north of Central Elsewhere: _ In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, three fires in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> totaling nearly 1,500 acres were spreading firefighters thin in the rough terrain Although one of the fires was only three acres, officials warned that it had to potential to rapidly become a major blaze. The fire near <LOCATION> Pinedale </LOCATION>, at 1,300 acres by far the largest of the three, was declared controlled Friday morning. Firefighters working on a 1,650-acre fire in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> continued mop-up work, and state Forestry Division crews contained fires covering almost 2,000 acres in <LOCATION> Converse </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION> counties. _ A wind-whipped fire in Echo Canyon in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> doubled in size overnight to about 650 acres, but fire bosses were optimistic it would be contained late Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> Firefighters controlled both the 900-acre blaze in Zion National Park and a 3,500-acre fire near the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> border. _ A 1,000-acre timberland fire near <LOCATION> Nixonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, that jumped plowed fire lines in five places Thursday was declared contained Friday Two water bucket-equipped helicopters helped contain the blaze, which began Wednesday on land owned by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Caribbean Leaders Say US Drug Fight Should Not Interfere In Region</HEAD>
<HEAD>By HELEN J. SIMON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leaders of 13 Caribbean nations have accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of interfering in their region's affairs as it cracks down on drugs and urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to halt the meddling. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> and Common Market _ ended five days of talks Friday without agreeing on <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s coup but they agreed to work toward eliminating obstacles to regional trade by Oct. 1. The leaders drafted a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saying that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was overstepping its jurisdiction by investigating alleged drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The contents of the letter were not revealed, but <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said it would be signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION> secretary general to represent all the leaders. Bird announced it would protest what the leaders considered a `` derogation'' of their local laws and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> violations of their sovereignty as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration seeks to win favor in an election year. Some of the leaders criticized <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> for making the announcement prematurely. Prime Minister <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Grenadines </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` bad manners.'' Others stressed their traditionally close ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said it had not intervened directly in their affairs. Bird, reading from a communique drafted by the leaders, said they also `` reaffirmed their total commitment to the fight against ... all illegal trafficking in drugs.'' `` They expressed their willingness to ccoperate with other countries for the establishment of internationally acceptable mechanisms to bring offenders to justice,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> has long been a source and an important conduit for drugs coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Cocaine from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> traditionaly passes through <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> ports before entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Much marijuana is also grown in the area. From the start of the meeting Monday, it was apparent the leaders were unlikely to reach unanimous agreement, as required by <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION> rules, on what position to take on the <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> military government that ousted President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a coup June 19. They debated options ranging from revoking <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s status as an observer on four <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION> standing committees to simply issuing a strong statement denouncing the coup. The leaders were more successful when talking about intra-regional trade. The leaders agreed to remove all trade obstacles, such as stamp duties and import licenses, by Oct. 1 and to study a request by the smaller countries to protect 23 items they consider too fragile to compete with imports. Trade and industry ministers will meet before the Oct. 1 deadline to decide which items should be excluded and for how long. <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION>, established in 1973 to promote regional trade and set common positions on international events, includes <LOCATION> Antigua-Barbuda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts-Nevis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Grenadines </ORGANIZATION> and Trinidad-Tobago.

 One of two pilots of a West German army helicopter that crashed in the Alps and killed all nine people aboard was drunk at the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Five civilians, the three-man crew and another West German soldier were killed when the Bell UH-1-D helicopter smashed into a cliff in the Bavarian Alps on Sunday.

 A cruise ship officer stripped to his shorts and leapt more than 50-feet into choppy night seas to rescue a drowning woman, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The woman either fell or jumped off the Scandinavian Sky cruise ship 11 miles east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> Thursday night, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sylvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaly </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and her rescuer, Staff Capt. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Kragelund </PERSON>, were treated and released from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> following the ships return, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Mullaly </PERSON>, who works at a topless nightclub in <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, is under investigation for possible intoxication, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. An investigation of the entire incident, including the ship's safety procedures, is underway, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Mullaly </PERSON> was spotted bobbing in the water as the ship returned from a daylong cruise, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kragelund </PERSON> raced from the ship's wheelhouse, peeling off his uniform as he ran and dived from a ship's rail, he said. As he swam to the woman, the ship's crew assumed `` man overboard'' alert stations and the vessel swung in a wide circle around the couple, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. `` Apparently they were retrieved from the water via ladder. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> headed to the scene but turned back when we found out they had her'' out of the water, he said.

<HEAD>Investigators Looking Into Whether Paisley Took Bribes In Navy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Court papers have revealed for the first time that federal agents are looking at whether one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s former top officials accepted bribes while he helped direct President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense buildup. A search warrant used by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in the June 14 search of defense consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s home in nearby <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said agents sought details about `` payment from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> in the form of checks, gifts or other forms of remuneration, or to his wife, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>'' at the time he was an assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Another entry states agents wanted information about `` payments or gratuities from <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> employees to Paisley'' before he left the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> is a division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. As an assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary between 1981 and 1987, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, 63, played a key role in guiding the enhancement of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> under then-Navy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. A former executive at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> left government to become a <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has surfaced as a key figure in the investigation into allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. To date, no one has been charged in the case. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the unnamed informer referred to in an early government affidavit who helped investigators launch the probe is a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> major who is now serving a prison sentence for child molestation. The Post, quoting unnamed sources, said consultant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON> offered inside information on Marine contracts to a defense firm and later agreed to cooperate with government investigators and secretly tape his conversations with other consultants. <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON>, 45, is serving a six-year sentence at a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state prison for his 1985 conviction on charges of indecent exposure and aggravated sexual battery in cases involving two girls aged nine and 10, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s house was one of as many as 40 premises across the nation searched on June 14, the day the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> revealed the existence of the investigation of alleged massive corruption in the $ 150 billion-a-year <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> purchasing system. The search warrant, which was released by a magistrate's clerk in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also sought evidence that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> gave <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, a Western painting titled `` Lonesome Whistle.'' They also sought evidence that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> or fellow consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> provided gratuities to <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, including `` money to <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>' companies, entertainment tickets, and tires.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents showed the government is investigating <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s work as a consultant to 10 defense contractors and disclosed the names of several <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, or former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, whose contacts with <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> are being investigated. The warrant sought any document `` establishing an employee or contractual relationship'' between <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> and these 10 companies: <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION>, Pocal, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Norden </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>. Agents are looking at <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s efforts to obtain government contracts for them from 1981 through 1988. Among the people mentioned specifically in the warrant was a person identified as <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON>, the principal deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for research, engineering and systems, was <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s deputy in the Pentagon His wife, <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON>, works for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON> did not return a telephone call to his office Friday. Also mentioned was <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a former deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> who now works for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said she would have no comment. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has not commented on the probe, but his attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, has criticized leaks of information about the probe and has dismissed the allegations as `` garbage.'' Of interest to investigators is <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s involvement _ both in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and as a consultant _ in the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest procurement programs. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> are partners in the $ 4 billion program awarded last year to build the new aircraft. In another instance, the government searched for evidence that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> supported <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> for the `` JVX project and V-22 engine,'' and `` payments or gratuities from <LOCATION> Pratt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> employees to <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> during his tenure as assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s involvement with foreign concerns also was targeted in the search warrant. Investigators sought information about <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s involvement with the <ORGANIZATION> Mazlat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> company. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> awarded a $ 26 million contract to consortium comprised of <LOCATION> Mazlat </LOCATION> and the American <ORGANIZATION> AAI </ORGANIZATION> corporation to build three remotely piloted vehicles, known as drones. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sought several items dealing with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, the St. Louis-based defense contractor. The company supplies American forces with helicopters and fighter planes, and is involved in efforts to sell advanced fighter aircraft to several nations. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> list of items seized by agents at the <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s home included tax returns, bank account numbers, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s security badge from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and a `` confidential 12 pg memo re visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no reaction to the revelations. `` We have it in hand and are studying it,'' he said. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivak </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, said the company `` knows of no payment of bribes by this company or any of its people'' to <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> or his wife while <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> or in private life. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linse </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, said he could not comment because he had not seen the warrant.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser that shot down an Iranian passenger jet it mistook for a fighter plane was out of action last month because its radar malfunctioned, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. But a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the breakdown on the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> in June was only a `` minor degradation'' and had no bearing on Sunday's disaster that left 290 dead in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the billion-dollar warship's high-tech radar system received signals from the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A300 identifying it as an Iranian F-14 fighter coming in for an attack. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all 290 people aboard were killed. The breakdown was reported on June 13 by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, although gulf-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials refused then to confirm that the problem lay in the computerized system, called Aegis. The Aegis system of computer-linked radar and weapons is designed primarily for defending a naval fleet in the open ocean from air and missile attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says it can detect, identify and head off a threat developing hundreds of miles away. The 9,600-ton <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> arrived in the gulf May 27, the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Aegis cruisers to be assigned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval force in the waterway. It was assigned to patrol in the southern gulf, but by about June 10 it was anchored off <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources said it was undergoing repair work on the radar system that lies at the core of its capabilities. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in the gulf, asked about the reported breakdown at that time, said only that the ship was in port for `` maintenance upkeep,'' the result of an unspecified problem. Officials here refused comment Friday, but a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, Lt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON>, confirmed the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had been down with a `` minor degradation'' of its radar system. He said there was no connection between that and the shooting down of the Iranian jetliner. `` The problem had absolutely no bearing on the whole incident,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` It -LRB- the cruiser -RRB- was never less than 100 percent up on any mission capability, including anti-aircraft warfare.'' He said he could not confirm that the ship was out of action for 16 days, as reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON> said the problem had actually been detected during the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' 32-day voyage from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, where it arrived May 22. A necessary replacement part was flown to the ship and installed by the ship's own crew, he said, `` and the ship was back up on line by June 6.'' He said he did not know why the ship was then off the line again, spending at least three days around June 10-13 at anchor outside <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, before it returned to its duty station in the southern gulf. Some of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' crew said they were puzzled why the ship had been ordered to make a rush departure from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> after only 90 hours of port preparation, and on arrival spent five days in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, `` sailing in circles'' as one officer described it, before entering the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. Many <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships, especially those with sophisticated electronics and other equipment, have civlian experts, known as `` tech reps,'' aboard to maintain and repair the gear. Most are employees of the manufacturers. There were no such representatives aboard the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. Its officers told journalists who rode the ship into the gulf that the crew was fully capable of maintaining and repairing the ship's complicated systems The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was riding at anchor off <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> for a third day Friday, but two other warships that contributed data to the investigation of the jetliner incident, the frigate <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON>, returned to duty in the gulf. Both had been nearby when the aircraft was shot down. The disaster followed a clash involving the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and some Iranian speedboats, two of which were sunk, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. Computer tapes from the warships are being sent back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for analysis at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Surface warfare Center in <LOCATION> Dahlgren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said they could offer no indication of when a team of six military investigators sent here to investigate the incident would complete their task and return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The team, headed by Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, arrived here on Tuesday with orders to deliver a report in 15 days if possible.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Less than three weeks after he seized power in a military coup, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> shredded <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s popular Constitution and dealt a major blow to the country's move toward democracy. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said in a live television broadcast Friday night from the Presidential Palace that a new constitution will be written soon. He said the one approved by a massive voter turnout in March 1987 was `` unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and emotion.'' `` It is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which nearly 70 percent of the population in the country is vegetating,'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said. `` The future depends on what we do, or refuse to do now,'' he said, adding that the new constitution will take `` Haitian reality into account.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> pledged his government would respect freedom of speech and assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and political parties. <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> remained calm late Friday night, as it was after the June 19 coup that sent President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> into exile. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said the current constitution _ the most liberal in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 184-year history and ardently defended by civic and political groups _ introduced foreign elements to <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> traditions. The constitution, approved by 99 percent of Haitians who voted in a March 29, 1987 referendum, prohibited close <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> collaborators from running for public office for a period of 10 years. It also provided for an independent <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to organize national elections. During the 20-minute speech, <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was flanked by <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s Cabinet ministers and top aides to former dictators <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and his father <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> After <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in 1986, <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ruled until <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s inauguration last February, a period tainted by army killings of peasants, demonstrators and opposition leaders. On Nov. 29, 1987, Duvalierists shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters while soldiers looked on and in some cases escorted the gunmen. The same day <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> dissolved the independent <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, then hand-picked another council, which ran the fraud-riddled January vote resulting in <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s election. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> spoke in the same Hall of Busts where <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> had held his three monthly news conferences. The entire High Command of the Haitian military was present, including Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, indicted earlier this year by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges on drug smuggling. Sitting in the front row among the invited guests were three former presidential candidates, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillipe-Auguste </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s minister of agriculture _ and <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s adviser on constitutional law. Also present were two <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> supporters who had been rejected as presidential candidates by the former independent <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Desinor </PERSON>. Asked if he thought the new constitution would promote democracy in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philippe-Auguste </PERSON> responded: `` Democracy is one thing, a constitution is another. ... All depends on whether the law, written or unwritten, is obeyed.'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> insisted that civil liberties would be respected under the new constitution. He said he opposed the constitutional provision banning <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> suporters from running for office. `` I think it is better to let the people decide for themselves whether they want to vote for former Duvalierists,'' he said.

 He survived <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a dangerous tour as an undercover decoy cop and two bouts with cancer that cost him his legs. Now <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON> is fighting to keep a desk job that officials contend he can no longer handle. `` They say that because I use two canes, I ca n't defend myself,'' the 43-year-old <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON> said Friday. Since his first amputation in 1980, <LOCATION> Neberieza </LOCATION> has been assigned to the front desk of a local precinct. The Police Department has tried since last summer to strip away that job, either by suspending him or putting him on medical disability, claiming he is medically unfit for the post. The city told <LOCATION> Neberieza </LOCATION> on Tuesday it was suspending him without pay or insurance until the city <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rules on whether he should be put on disability pension. `` What has been filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> are specifications stating that, based on evaluations, he is not able to fully perform the functions of a police officer,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmgard </PERSON>, the city's assistant corporation counsel. But Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> ruled Thursday that <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON> is entitled to a Police Board hearing before the board rules, and extended an order he first issued in October that bars the city from taking <LOCATION> Neberieza </LOCATION> off the payroll without such a hearing. `` It makes no sense for a person who has performed his duties, is performing his duties, has a doctor's affidavit that he can do a desk job, to be denied -LRB- salary and medical insurance -RRB- without a hearing,'' the judge said. The Police Board hearing is scheduled for July 15. <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON>, who supports his wife and three children on his $ 35,000 salary, said he wants to stay on active duty another 15 years to qualify for full pension. On disability, he would receive half pay for four years, and a small annuity thereafter. `` I ca n't afford to settle for a small annuity,'' he said. `` I have a mortgage and bills like anyone else. `` I feel I fit the definition of a policeman. I've done everything they've asked me to do.'' `` He has proved he can do the job,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dineen </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Fraternal Order of Police. `` He has been doing it for seven years.'' <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON> joined the police force 15 years ago after a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> tour with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. He eventually was assigned to an undercover unit of decoys who prowled subways, acting like drunks or sleeping commuters to lure muggers. But in 1980, his right leg was removed at the hip because of cancer. That meant a limited-duty job; he was assigned to a neighborhood police station's front desk. Five years later, he developed heart trouble and had quadruple bypass surgery. It was n't until last year, when <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON> lost his left leg below the knee to cancer, that the city decided it no longer could use him. `` The two requirements to remain on the job are that they must be able to ambulate independently and be able to fire a firearm. If he ca n't protect himself, how could he protect the citizen?'' Police Commander <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holton </PERSON>, the department's personnel commander, told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON>, who walks on two artificial legs, said he is no more disabled than any number of other handicapped officers performing limited-duty jobs. His attorney, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, said the department has 600 `` light duty'' jobs and <PERSON> Neberieza </PERSON> easily could fill one of them. Except for his court appearance, she said, he has n't missed a day of work.

 Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> will withdraw from foreign lands by the end of the century, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official says a Soviet pullout may be imminent in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday that there are `` increasing indications'' of a unilateral withdrawal from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which was invaded by Soviet troops in 1956 to crush an uprising. Reports of a possible Soviet withdrawal have circulated for a year and a half. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said its information is based on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, speaking to Western reporters Friday, gave no indication that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> union </LOCATION> was preparing a unilateral withdrawal from an East bloc nation before 2000. The Soviet government chief told Western reporters such moves could come only in the context of a general withdrawal involving Western forces as well. He said his government feels no armies should be on foreign territory _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION>. `` Our proposal is this: let us take out all the armies,'' he said. `` The armies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are part of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact armies. Let us agree on a radical solution in the West and in the East.'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units are stationed in several Soviet bloc countries, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> cautioned that after announcing troop withdrawals form <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1983, the Soviets built their forces in that country back to the same levels within three years. Currently, four Soviet tank and motorized rifle divisions remain in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The troops are not on the front lines opposite <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces, however, because <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is bordered to the west by three <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations and politically neutral <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Even with a withdrawal, said <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact would hold a 2-1 advantage over the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in tanks, artillery and armored personnel vehicles. In talks with reporters, <PERSON> Ryzkhov </PERSON> also seemed to dash hopes for any rehabilitation soon of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> who is famed for his liberal policies. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> confirmed that at the recent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed the need for `` socialism with a human face.'' That phrase was used to describe <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' of 1968, which provoked a Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion in August of that year and cost <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> his job as party chief in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Western reporters asked <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who attended a three-day economic conference that ended Thursday, whether the time had not come for <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> to be rehabilitated. He replied: `` The rehabilitation of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, that is a question for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. I do not intend to deal with the internal problems of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. As far as I know the Czechoslovak party does not intend to deal with that.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, now 66, said in an Austrian Television interview broadcast Thursday that the current leadership in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> should adopt <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Most are similar to reforms <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> introduced here 20 years ago.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian jetliner has prompted airlines flying over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to seek ways to avoid military confrontations. The issue topped the agenda when technical experts from six major airlines operating passenger flights in the gulf area held a regular meeting at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday's session also was attended by an official of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that on July 13 is to consider <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s request for an investigation into the tragedy. Association officials would not comment when asked about the possibility of rerouting flights. They also declined to talk about reported complaints of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s contradicting plane instructions from civilian air controllers. `` We reviewed procedures in the gulf area to see if the airlines could help improve civil-military coordination,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, head of the group's technical department. `` We saw a number of areas where we could be helpful,'' he said in a telephone interview. He declined to elaborate. Asked whether rerouting was discussed, he said: `` Any routing changes through the gulf is a matter for <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> _ the governments.'' But the association, an industry association grouping most of the world's airlines, seemed certain to be considering the idea, too. `` We are in close touch with <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> on technical aspects,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials say they were unable to communicate with or identify <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight 655 on Sunday before blasting it out of the sky with a missile. All 290 people aboard were killed. The technical group did not discuss details of the incident because it is still under investigation, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We have no firm information to work with and see no point in speculating,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined to identify the airlines that took part in the one-day meeting or the <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> representative.

 The former top education adviser to Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received a 2 -LCB- - year prison term and was ordered to repay the $ 80,000 he admitted he helped skim from an adult education program he ran <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION> was ordered Friday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> to surrender to federal officials Aug. 5. <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> did not decide where <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> will serve his term. The sentence was half the five-year term Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gants </PERSON> had sought. `` He saw the hopes and dreams of these people for adult education to be his hopes and dreams for a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> house or a boat,'' <PERSON> Gants </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> administered an adult education program designed to help immigrants and the illiterate. He was considered the mastermind of a plan that involved paying inflated classroom rent and receiving some of the money back, taking the salaries of fictitious employees and skimming funds indended to pay for classroom renovations. He pleaded guilty in April to five charges of conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion in a scheme with three others accused of bilking the program of some $ 80,000. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> would be eligible to seek parole in 10 months, <PERSON> Gants </PERSON> said, but would likely serve between a year and 18 months. In a plea bargaining agreement, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> testified in the trial of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, whom federal prosecutors called one of the scheme's `` minor players.'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, whose trial ended in a mistrial, pleaded guilty to a single count of mail fraud in a plea bargain last month and received a suspended sentence. Before <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s sentencing, he apologized `` to the citizens who entrusted me with public responsibility because I did not live up to that.'' His case centered around activities that began between 1979 and early 1983 and ended a few weeks before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> named him as his chief education adviser. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> was the highest-ranking member of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration to face criminal indictment The Democratic presidential contender condemned <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s activities and said his administration is cooperating with all investigations, including two pending state probes. <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> also sentenced <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>'s older brother, to two years in prison on a related conviction. He also must pay a $ 22,000 fine. Sentencing was delayed for a third convicted conspirator, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrotta </PERSON>. The judge said <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> also is cooperating with a pending federal investigation, the details of which have not been revealed.

The charges include forgery, larceny, conflict of interest, tax evasion and theft.

 Torrential rains swelled rivers and sparked flooding that crushed homes and capsized boats, marooning millions of people and killing up to 115, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> warned that the flooding that has plagued the country for the past week could worsen in the next two days. The board said in a statement issued Friday that all rivers in the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> basin were rising from the rain and the onrush of waters from northeastern Indian states. The army was called out Friday to assist with rescue opertions. Press reports said as many as 5 million people were marooned in northeastern districts. `` The number of marooned people is so huge you can not bring all of them to safer places,'' said an official in the town of <LOCATION> Sunamganj </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Sunamganj </LOCATION> is 112 miles northeast of the capital at <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Nurul </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON> flew to the <LOCATION> Sunamganj </LOCATION> area by helicopter Friday to assess flood damage. The aircraft was unable to land because no suitable dry ground could be found, an aide said today on condition of anonymity. Twenty-four more deaths occurred Friday, according to local government officials and newspaper reports, raising the unofficial death toll to at least 115. The government confirmed 10 new deaths and said its official count stood at 60. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, an independent English-language daily, and <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION>, a Bengali-language daily, blamed the deaths on houses collapsing and boats capsizing. Most of the deaths were reported in the northeast, which has been hardest hit by the floods. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the poorest nations in the world with a population of more than 105 million, often suffers flooding during the annual monsoon rain season. Its low-lying land is vulnerable because not enough dams have been constructed on major rivers to control water flow. Press reports said rescue efforts were hampered by relentless rain. Thousands of people were trapped on rooftops or high ground without food, press reports said. The <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said there were reports of outbreaks of diarrhea and other water-borne diseases because of a shortage of pure drinking water. The northeastern tea-growing district of <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION> was all but cut off from the rest of the country Friday when the main highway bridge washed away. Air service to the region was suspended earlier in the week when runways flooded. In <LOCATION> Hobiganj </LOCATION>, just southwest of <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION>, a tributary of the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was flowing more than 5 feet above flood level, the highest in memory, the <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Moulvibazar </LOCATION> in the district just south of <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION>, town leaders urged residents to leave for higher ground as the town's protective embankment threatened to cave in, officials there said

<HEAD>Window Service to be Restored to Normal Levels in September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will be restoring full window service that was cut at the nation's post offices in February to save money. Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said on Friday that managers have found enough savings in other areas to re-open windows Sept. 10 to `` the same level of service that existed prior to Feb. 13.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said local managers will have the discretion to decide what changes are best for their community. For example, in some areas evening hours may be expanded, while in others an extra clerk may be put on at busy times instead of having longer hours with fewer clerks. The cuts in window service, one step to trim spending by $ 160 million, amounted to about half a day a week, and in many areas that meant closing offices on Saturdays. Other communities had their post offices closed one morning or one afternoon a week. The changes drew considerable criticism, particularly since they occurred just before an increase in postal rates. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has struggled in his four months in office to explain that the rate hike was initiated more than a year ago because of growing deficits, while the service cuts were required when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered a sudden reduction in postal spending. In a related development later Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced it was suspending all work on a controversial contract with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> computer billionaire <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, who was studying ways to improve the agency's efficiency. Under terms of the deal with <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, the initial $ 500,000 phase of the work was to be followed by a second phase in which payment would be based on a percentage of any savings realized by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. That apparently open-ended deal has generated controversy. At least two competitors of <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> complained to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which ordered the pact suspended. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, however, has argued that board has no jurisdiction over its activities. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said late Friday it believed its contract with <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> was a `` valuable and innovative approach'' to making operations more efficient, but that it suspended the contract because of <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> board's order. The dispute probably will have to be settled in federal court.

<HEAD>Assembly Passes Laws To Subpoena Ex-President</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> today passed two laws that could force former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> to testify on charges of corruption that allegedly occurred during his seven-year tenure. Government party officials said they would ask President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo to veto the laws approved by the opposition-controlled legislature. The proposals were passed 164-125, with three absentions. If vetoed, the bills likely would die because the opposition lacks the two-thirds legislative majority needed to override a presidential veto. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s three predominant opposition parties together control 166 seats in the 299-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> criticized the proposals and said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would certainly veto them. Party officials argued the bills are unconstitutional. `` It is highly regrettable that the opposition rammed the law bills through the Assembly in disregard of our repeated warnings that they would be vetoed,'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> floor leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoon-hwan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-ki </PERSON>, floor leader for the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group, said he doubted <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would veto the bills. `` I do n't think President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would veto the bills. He has repeatedly promised that there would be no sanctuary in investigating past corruption and irregularities,'' the opposition leader said. The legislation contains a provision that empowers the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to subpoena witnesses with writs of arraignment issued by courts of law. Opposition politicians said such a law is needed to compel all witnesses to testify in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s huge government corruption case. They said privately that the main targets of the laws are <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and other top government officials maintain that they would support efforts to ferret out all past corruption and irregularities under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> but the president oppose any moves to make the Chun testify or stand trial. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, whose term ended in February, has come under public fire for alleged involvement in large-scale financial scandals. One of his brothers, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, was arrested in March for embezzling millions of dollars. Several parliamentary committees were organized this week to look into alleged corruption and other problems under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. One committee is charged with probing a 1980 anti-government uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> that left nearly 200 dead and more than 800 others injured, according to official count. Opposition and dissident groups allege that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, helped mastermind the brutal suppression of the uprising.

<TEXT>
 Astronaut <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> says his two rides in an escape basket down a `` slide-for-life'' wire should give other astronauts and workers confidence that the space shuttle launch pad emergency system is safe. <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> made the first trip alone Friday, then was joined by two safety workers for the second zip down the wire from the 195-foot level of shuttle launch pad 39B. A platform at that level provides access to the crew cabin of space shuttle Discovery. `` It was not a thrill ride, it was a very gentle ride; it looks worse than it is,'' <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> told reporters. It was the first time humans had ridden the basket since it was installed several years ago for the shuttle program. Astronauts and launch pad personnel would use the system in case of a fire, fuel or gas leak or other emergency on the pad that gave them time to reach the baskets. The baskets, dropping at 50 mph, are halted abruptly at the bottom of the wire by a braking system, backed up by a rope net. There are seven baskets, each designed to hold three people. Each trip Friday took about 20 seconds, with a quick run to an underground bunker at the bottom taking another 15 seconds. Until recently, some <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials felt the swift ride would be risky and should be attempted only in an actual emergency. Earlier tests were run with sandbags substituting for humans. But with the added emphasis on safety after the loss of the shuttle Challenger and its seven crew members, the space agency decided to test the basket system with humans after making several improvements. <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> and the two safety workers volunteered for the job. `` I've always had confidence in the system, but I felt it was important to put someone in the basket to show people that it worked the way it is designed,'' <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> said. `` Maybe people were hesitant about using it before, but I think this test will give them confidence and they will have no qualms about getting in the baskets if they have to,'' he added. Among the system's improvements were the addition of two baskets; a side exit in each basket to ease exiting; added flame-protective material; and an anti-rollback brake to ensure the basket stops as quickly as possible. Discovery was moved to the launch pad on Monday to prepare for the first shuttle launch since Challenger exploded after takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986. The launch is scheduled for early September.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said today that an international peacekeeping force could prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from retaking power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after Vietnamese occupation forces leave. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> allies do not want to see a return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who killed up to 3 million people when they ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion of 1978. Previously, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which strongly backs a three-party resistance coalition that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, did not issue a strong public stand on the issue. <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> spoke at a news conference ending a three-day annual conference of foreign ministers of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> know that they can not come back because we do n't support them to come back,'' he said. `` So I think we can use a lot of pressure besides the peacekeeping force. `` They know that <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> ... is trying to support a resolution of the Cambodian problem by not supporting the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. At the same news conference, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that during his upcoming visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he plans to stress <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s main source of arms `` The Chinese attitude toward the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the nature of the continuing support to an overall Cambodian settlement will be a very important factor, and recent statements by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are encouraging in that regard,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Also important to a political settlement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s influence on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> gives <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> $ 2 billion in military aid a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion in December 1978. During that time, they killed millions of Cambodians. The group is known for its radical agrarian communism. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for a central role in any settlement for Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, a former Cambodian head of state who now leads the guerrilla coalition. The third group in the resistance is led by <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, a Western-leaning politician. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he hoped the Cambodian peace talks planned for <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> on July 25 would be successful. The talks are to involve the guerrilla groups, the Vietnamese-installed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the ASEAN countries. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will pull its estimated 140,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990 and has begun withdrawing 50,000 troops in an operation to be completed in December. Delegates said <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> ministers did not discuss the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> issue during their conference on Monday and Tuesday. Bit it became a dominant topic when the Western dialogue partners joined in consultations starting Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> groups <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has chosen his fourth government since his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a landslide electoral victory in October 1982. Government spokesman <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Solana </PERSON> said the new cabinet, which includes the first two women named to a <PERSON> Gonazalez </PERSON> government, would be sworn in on Tuesday. Seven cabinet posts changed hands and 10 others remained unchanged. The announcement of the cabinet selections Friday came after reports of conflicts among education, justice, transportation and industry ministers. The most notable change came in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, where labor activist and <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> executive committee member <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcuera </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrionuevo </PERSON>, who moved to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>.

Both unions have made strong calls for <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> to take a more left-wing approach to economic issues. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancha </PERSON>, leader of the largest opposition party, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Friday `` the new cabinet represents a very little change, and recognizes the rightness of our party's views that basic government services had collapsed.'' Police unions praised <PERSON> Barrionuevo </PERSON> on Friday. But human rights groups have criticized him for alleged reluctance to investigate charges police brutality and misconduct. A series of strikes last spring by teachers demanding higher wages and protests by students and university professors over reform programs undermined the standing of former Education Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Maravall </PERSON>.

 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> indicated today that several, but not all, of the island's old-guard leaders are to retire. Ten of the 31 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> were named to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is composed primarily of retired officials. <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> told reporters that advisory panel members will not sit on the new <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to be named Thursday at the end of the weeklong 13th party congress. The average age of current <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members is 70, with seven members more than 80 years old. More than half fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> from the Chinese mainland when his Nationalist government was routed by the Communists in 1949. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the Kuomintang, have stressed the importance of promoting younger party members who represent the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> public. Young party members have criticized old-guard conservatives from the mainland for not being enthusiastic about the liberalization policies initiated by President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> before his death in January. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, the eldest son of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, lifted martial law, allowed new political parties and eased a ban on travel to mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Still to be changed is the parliamentary system in which mainland Chinese Nationalists hold a majority of seats to back the party's claim that it remains the rightful ruler of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, who was acclaimed the first native Taiwanese party chairman Friday, has vowed to continue the process of democratic change and liberalization but has moved cautiously in past months as he has sought to consolidate power. The new members of the advisory committee, proposed by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and approved by the congress, include five of seven octagenarians on the Central Standing Committee. Three media executives on the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who have said they want to give way to a younger leadership also were named to the advisory panel. But Premier <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-hwa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-huan </PERSON>, secretary to the president, were not named to the advisory group. The two 74-year-olds are influential conservatives and liberals fear they could block reforms. `` This will be a very conservative restructuring,'' said political journalist <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>. But he added that the conservative old-guard's power base was dwindling and younger members would likely be more willing to speak up. The 1,209 congress delegates will elect a 180-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. For the first time, the vote will not be limited to candidates proposed by the party. The new <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will meet Thursday to name the new Central Standing Committee. A Cabinet overhaul is expected later.

 The drought has claimed yet another group of victims: the migrant farm workers who find their labor is unneeded as the crops they normally pick shrivel in the dusty fields of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` We want to cry,'' said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON>, who recently traveled with 14 others from her home in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` We need the money and we have come so far.

Now Ms. <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> and her family and friends are stranded in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where officials estimate 4,000 to 5,000 migrant workers are victims of the nation's worst drought since the 1930s.

But the parched summer stymied them. `` There is very little sweet corn because of the drought, and as far as I'm concerned there will be no lima bean or pumpkin harvest,'' Ms. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. Most of the workers earn the minimum wage of $ 3.35 per hour. What they make during seven months on the road must carry them to the next harvest season. `` Some have been here since June, and have worked two or three days at the most _ they're getting checks of $ 40,'' Ms. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. Many have been living in parks, she added. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Granadas </PERSON> and his family _ his wife and their five children, eight brothers, his parents, an uncle and a cousin _ have been renting a home in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, about 40 miles to the east. `` But I am worried because I have to pay the rent,'' which is $ 250 a month, said <PERSON> Granadas </PERSON>, who has been looking for work since June 20. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a support agency for migrant workers, appealed this week to Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> for emergency money for food, shelter and transportation for the itinerants who ca n't find work. The agency's $ 73,000 assistance budget for 1988 will be exhausted in a month, executive director <PERSON> Lupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s office said Friday the request was being reviewed. This time last year, Mrs. <PERSON> Zamorano </PERSON>, her husband, Justo, and two of their children worked at a cannery in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. They had full-time jobs on the assembly line and housing in the company's migrant camp. By the end of the season, they earned $ 7,000. This year, the Zamoranos have free housing but little to do. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has provided groceries and a little money for gasoline and spare parts for the 1976 pickup in which the group of 15 made the 1,500-mile, three-day trip from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. But without the money for the return trip, even giving up and going home seems impossible.

 The pilot of the Iranian jetliner the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shot down last weekend had a 5-year-old daughter who is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen, and family members say explaining the way her father died wo n't be easy. `` She was proud to be an American,'' said <PERSON> Nahy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON>, the sister of pilot <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaian </PERSON>'s wife. The child was born in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> while Mrs. <PERSON> Rezaian </PERSON> was visiting her sister. `` She always said to the other children, ` I'm the American.' How is she -LRB- the mother -RRB- going to tell her that her father was shot down by Americans when she's an American?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said Friday. The Rezaians had two other children. Mrs. <PERSON> Sagedhi </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Kamran </PERSON>, said the pilot considered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> his second home. `` He liked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> very much,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` He had a good time here,'' added <PERSON> Kamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Rezaian </PERSON> was trained in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Sadeghis </PERSON> said because of the increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, they knew their brother-in-law's job had become more dangerous. Even so, said <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON>, she considered his job routine. She was a stewardess in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from 1968 to 1973. `` I'm familiar with the flights. They are all so crowded.'' <PERSON> Kamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1971 to attend the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> and now works for the school as a computer programmer. The couple said they are n't sure who to blame for the incident Sunday, in which the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus A300, which carried 290 people. `` All Iranians do not represent the Iranian government,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` Same with the Americans and the American government. They are following their own policies. I blame the situation. It's the war that made the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to be there.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said her sister has been living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for 10 months because of the fighting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Sadeghis had a strong reaction to early reports that the downed flight was a `` suicide mission,'' with orders to crash into the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. `` No, no. If you had known him, if you could talk to him once, you would never imagine that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` It's not even possible. He was a very good human being. He valued people. He valued people's lives. `` He loved his family, he loved his kids,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` He was very responsible and would never do anything to jeopardize his own life.'' Now, Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said, her concerns lie with her sister, and how she `` can survive this with her children.'' She said the children had not been told yet how their father died. The couple said that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offers to provide financial help, the payment should go directly to the families. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays them money, I do n't want them to pay the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` If they do, they should pay the victims directly. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs money. Without it, maybe it would stop the war.''

<HEAD>Government Proposes Regional Black Councils</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has proposed the creation of regional legislative councils to address matters related solely to blacks. Anti-apartheid activists condemned the proposal. Blacks would elect members to the regional councils under the proposed Extension of Political Participation Bill, which was published Friday in the official Government Gazette. The bill did not specify how many councils would be established. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would have the power to veto bills passed by the councils. Presently, blacks can vote only in municipal elections and in 10 homelands. Elected black officials are widely viewed in their communities as collaborators with the white-led government. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no representation in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and can not vote in national elections. Its 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The proposed councils would have authority over regional matters concerning blacks such as education, welfare, local government and community development. `` It is the government's viewpoint that all communities should participate in the government process on the different levels,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, minister of constitutional development and planning. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal was `` one of those hopeless efforts to avoid the realities of the South African situation.'' `` The duplication of -LRB- government -RRB- structures to run this country has become totally absurd,'' she said. Anti-apartheid activists have rejected all the government's major political reform proposals in recent years, saying they entrench white domination and continue to divide political participation by race The government is seeking comment on the latest proposal before deciding whether it will be introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Malaysian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> today urged acting Lord President Justice <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, the country's highest ranking judge, to resign and said it would begin contempt of court proceedings against him The unprecedented action by the <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 2,500 lawyers in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, was the latest move in a battle between Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> and the judiciary, the only branch of government still independent of his control. The battle began May 26 when the government suspended the previous Lord President, <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Salleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abas </PERSON>, and accused him of `` lack of dignity, judicial propriety and impartiality.'' <PERSON> Salleh </PERSON> had written to King <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> <PERSON> Iskandar </PERSON> and complained that <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> had been attacking the judiciary. Last Saturday, five <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges ordered a tribunal hearing the charges against <PERSON> Salleh </PERSON> not to advise the king on whether to remove <PERSON> Salleh </PERSON> permanently until it received further orders. On Wednesday, the king suspended the five judges and ordered them to face a tribunal that will decide whether they will be removed permanently. He acted on a request from <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, who alleged that the five were guilty of misbehavior. `` By his recent actions ... <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> has shown himself as unfit for judicial office,'' the council said. `` The Malaysian Bar calls for immediate revocation of the suspension of the five judges of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, as the suspensions are totally inconsistent with the independence of the judiciary and will lead to the destruction of the judiciary as an independent branch of government,'' the council said. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Baba </PERSON> denied on Friday that politicians were undermining the independence of the judiciary. In February, the high court ruled that <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON>'s party, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, was illegal because it had branches that were not registered with the authorities as required by law. Since then, <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> has set up a new party called `` New UMNO'' and has been busy recruiting old members.

 An 11-year-old aviator who plans to emulate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a bit of a scare. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> was piloting his <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> 252 two-seater toward busy <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Friday evening when the plane's electrical power _ and radio _ went dead `` I thought we might get in trouble if we ca n't call the tower,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> said later. But the power outage lasted only about 10 seconds and he landed safely. `` I thought it was neat to land at a big airport,'' the <LOCATION> Oceano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, boy said. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who is accompanied by a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, hopped across the country from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kerrville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Today _ if the plane's electrical problems are sorted out _ he and his companion planned to head toward <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. His flight plan calls for stops in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. `` I want to show all other kids across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that if I can do this trip, they can do this trip,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> said Friday at <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> before taking off for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, the son of a commercial pilot, first took the controls of a plane at age 4, and began flying with an instructor at 7. <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before completing his 33 -LCB- - hour, non-stop solo flight across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1927 Last year, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> became the youngest flier to cross the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON>, a 9-year-old from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, broke the record in April by making a California-to-Massachusetts round trip. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who will be a fifth-grader this fall, said this trip would make him the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot. He is accompanied by <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> `` Duke'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 46, a retired commander at <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War pilot. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> has done all of the flying, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. The two flew to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in a borrowed plane, then traded it for a new aircraft that was built for the trans-Atlantic journey. Because <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> is limiting the boy's flying time to less than eight hours at a time, the flight will be stretched out over five days. `` He's doing good; he's a tiger,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. `` He was sick on the flight from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but he flew right through it. He's got around 270 hours of flying time in and he's very responsive Tell him to do something and he does it.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, founded a company that raised money to pay for the flight.

 A pilot who crash landed in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> while making a charity flight to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> battlefield where he was shot and partially paralyzed during World War II says he will leave his plane behind as a historical marker. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who is paralyzed from the chest down, said Friday he was abandoning the trip to Stolberg, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He made the emergency landing Thursday after his single-engine, hand-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> ran out of gas about 40 miles north of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Air Base at Sondrestrom, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. The 63-year-old <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> businessman suffered a cut and some bruises in the crash. He said he would take a military flight to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a commercial flight home tonight. `` We've decided to leave it up there,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said of his airplane during a telephone interview from the base. `` It's going to be a historical marker,'' he added, half in jest. Although the plane was not badly damaged, Col. Guy Sumter, commander of the supply base at <LOCATION> Sondrestrom </LOCATION>, said it may not be possible to remove the aircraft, which is nose down in a ditch next to a pond. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> left <LOCATION> DeKalb-Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> on July 1 but was delayed in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by bad weather. He finally resumed the flight Thursday morning, three days after he had planned to reach <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. But he ran into more harsh weather off the coast of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and his 19-year-old plane was blown off course. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> put in an emergency call and was shocked when it was answered by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Epps </PERSON>, the owner of <ORGANIZATION> Epps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> DeKalb-Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, who was in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> on business. `` I felt God was answering,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said of hearing his old friend's voice. <PERSON> Epps </PERSON> notified the base that <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was lost and almost out of fuel. On <PERSON> Epps </PERSON>' advice, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> climbed to 7,000 feet so the base could locate him on radar. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said he got his bearings when the clouds cleared as he approached the coast of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and saw an island he recognized from his maps as being north of his plotted course. As he turned south toward the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base, the plane ran out of fuel. `` All I saw was mountains and rocks. I looked down and I saw a little lake and it had a little green next to it and I said, ` That looks better than anything else,''' he said. `` I was pretty sure I was n't going to be in this life when I got on the ground,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` I realized the plane had stopped and I was on the ground, but I could n't remember where I was and what I was doing there.'' He was rescued a short time later. `` We knew when he got to the coast -LRB- by tracking him on radar -RRB- and we knew where he should have been,'' Sumter said. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s trip was planned as a fund-raising project for the <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and its Center for Independent Living. Supporters pledged up to $ 1 for each mile covered by <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a founding director of the 13-year-old medical facility for spinal-cord-injured patients. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> had planned to complete the 4,669-mile flight to <LOCATION> Aachen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on Monday. City officials from nearby Stolberg, site of the World War II battlefield where he was shot by a German sniper in 1945, had planned a reception at historic <LOCATION> Stolberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> in his honor.

<TEXT>
 Rain drenched parts of the Midwest today while triple-digit, record-setting temperatures were forecast for many Eastern states in a continuing heat wave that contributed to the death of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> infant. Much of the central Plains reported heavy rains Friday night and early today from thunderstorms extending across western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Severe thunderstorm activity diminished early Friday evening after touching off almost a dozen tornadoes over northeast <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. No major damage was reported. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a 3 -LCB- - month-old girl died Thursday of dehydration and exposure to extreme heat after her mother apparently left her in a closed car for four hours At <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 30 miles to the west, Friday's high of 99 broke the record of 97 set in 1876. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> broiled under a second straight day of 100-degree heat Friday. Triple-digit record highs were reported in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the South Bend high of 97 on Friday broke the record of 96 set in 1985. Other <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> cities sweltered under even hotter conditions, including 102 at <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>; 101 at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>; and 100 at Terre Haute. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the state issued an ozone advisory for parts of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> counties and some adjacent territory Friday after levels of the pollutant reached up to 127 parts per billion. A level of 120 parts per billion is considered `` unhealthful,'' said an agency spokesman. Ozone is created when heat and the sun react with other pollutants such as hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, state officials said brook trout and other fish were dying as water temperatures in southern streams and rivers rose to more than 80 degrees. `` They're cold-water animals and they die of heat stroke,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a Fish and Game Department district manager. Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms from northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> across the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the central and southern Plains and the central and southern Rockies to portions of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>; and showers and thunderstorms over the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, central and southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states. Most of the nation was forecast to have high temperatures between 85 and 95 degrees; record temperatures of around 100 degrees were forecast through the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> valleys, across <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and over portions of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>; in the lower 80s over northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and across the western <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>; the upper 60s and 70s along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>; over 100 through interior valleys of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; and near 110 in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Authorities Lift Curfew Imposed After Riots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities today lifted a dusk-to-dawn curfew that was imposed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> after thousands of students rioted in the streets on June 21, state radio said. A ban on public gatherings also was lifted, the broadcast said. According to the government, six policemen and three civilians were killed in the rioting. The violence erupted after university students pressed demands, including release of colleagues detained in earlier protests, and the government responded by closing the schools. The government said that on Thursday and Friday, it freed all 784 people detained in connection with last month's riots and other rioting in March. Of those, 288 were students, it said. The government also for the first time made a concession to student demands, announcing on Friday that students expelled from schools for the March-June demonstrations will be readmitted.

<HEAD>Government Drafts Regulations To Protect Women Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has drafted comprehensive rules for women workers, barring them from hard physical labor and lengthening their maternity leaves, a report said today. The regulations also ban discrimination against women, but only if the work is deemed `` suitable for women workers,'' according to the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. It said the regulations stipulate the kind and intensity of work suitable to women and bar them from labor-intensive jobs such as mining and leather-making. The criteria used in determining what jobs were suitable was not given. The regulations were drafted by the ministries of labor and public health, the <ORGANIZATION> All-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> All-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, and have been approved in principle by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the top executive body, the report said The rules guarantee women the right to refuse job assignments that could harm their health; allow one year of maternity leave with 90 paid days, up from the current 56; and guarantee rest periods for pregnant and menstruating women and those who have just had abortions. The newspaper did not comment on the possibility that the regulations would discourage employers from hiring women, who according to official reports already face greater difficulty than men in finding urban jobs. In the countryside most women do farmwork, although growing numbers of male peasants are leaving the land to work in small factories. The traditional belief that women are inferior to men is still deeply ingrained in Chinese society. The Guangming Daily reported last year that dozens of women graduates of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were rejected by the work units to which the state had assigned them. Some units said they did not employ women. Now that factory managers have been given the power to fire workers in recent years, women have been dismissed in larger numbers than men, official reports have said. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said the new regulations `` contain clear stipulations that all working units suitable for women workers should not reject female job applicants on any pretext.'' It did not say what sanctions, if any, would be applied against employers found guilty of discrimination. Chinese law already bars women from working in mines, but thousands are estimated to do so because mining often is the best-paid work in rural areas. Despite the egalitarian ideology of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> and the equality still promised in the Constitution, women have always been treated as second-class citizens in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. During <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s rule, when government and party committees on various levels were handpicked, one or two women would be put on them. Now there is limited choice in elections for such committees, and women are getting voted out.

 Two white men pleaded innocent to charges that they helped batter down the door of a black family's home, yelled racial slurs and hurled cinder blocks before they were driven away at knifepoint The two _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterhouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchette </PERSON>, 29 _ were arraigned Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges of assault and battery, malicious destruction of real property, threats, assault in a dwelling, and violation of civil rights. Waterhouse and <PERSON> Blanchette </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, were held on $ 300,000 double surety bonds, or $ 30,000 cash bail. The two men were indicted last week in the June 19 attack on the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> family, along with two other white men from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> and a white woman from nearby <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>. Both towns are suburbs of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` This is considered a serious serious matter and is being prosecuted as a priority,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Samoluk </PERSON>, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. `` The DA is making it clear that it will not be tolerated.'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in court that Waterhouse was the `` leader of the pack'' that battered down the door of <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyston </PERSON>'s home, entered yelling racial slurs and forced 32-year-old <PERSON> Moyston </PERSON> from the livingroom into the kitchen. `` They came in yelling, ` We want you, nigger! We want a piece of you, nigger!''' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Hiller </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moyston </PERSON> grabbed a knife in the kitchen and drove the attackers back out the front door, where he was joined by a relative, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> McNichols </PERSON>. Waterhouse struck <ORGANIZATION> McNichols </ORGANIZATION> in the mouth, knocking him unconscious and opening a wound that took 18 stitches to close, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. The five attackers left the property after hurling cinder blocks at the house and breaking windows, authorities said. `` When they were leaving, they said, ` We're going to take care of you, niggers, we're going to come back,''' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. The prosecutor had asked <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> to hold Waterhouse on $ 500,000 double surety and <PERSON> Blanchette </PERSON> on $ 200,000. During the hearing, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said he requested a higher bail for Waterhouse because of the suspect's record of violent behavior and because Waterhouse is currently the target of a grand jury probe into the stabbing death of a black man whose body was found in <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION> last month. He refused to elaborate after the hearing. The co-defendants, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soda </PERSON>, both 18, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmartin </PERSON>, 20, are scheduled to be arraigned July 15.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said today that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian airliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> was dramatic proof of what an American policy of building up tensions can lead to. It was the highest-level official Soviet comment to date on Sunday's disaster, in which the cruiser USS Vincennes shot down an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said he crew mistook the plane for an F-14 fighter. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all 290 people aboard were killed. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> at <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>'s request to discuss various regional issues, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. It provided a brief report on the meeting. Commenting on the airliner's destruction, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` This was not an accident, but dramatic evidence showing what a policy from positions of strength and of building up tensions can lead to.'' <PERSON> Shevaradnadze </PERSON> also repeated the Kremlin's demand that all foreign warships withdraw from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The Soviets contend such a concentration of military might increases the danger of conflict. Since the airliner's destruction, Soviet officials have issued relatively mild criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, apparently because of reluctance to cause any chill in improved superpower relations. State-run media have carried much tougher remarks, including accusations that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship committed `` deliberate mass murder in cold blood.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, a member of the 13-man ruling Politburo, was the highest-level <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> official to comment publicly on the Iranian airliner disaster. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet foreign minister and <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> also discussed the Nicaraguan conflict and that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> criticized `` the anti-Nicaraguan policy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the Soviets firmly intend to keep providing aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government, which is fighting U.S.-backed Contra rebels. He said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government `` is fighting for the independence and sovereignty of its country, for the right of its people to have a free choice,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 Five people, including three Britons, died in raging forest fires on the western resort islands of Cephalonia and <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION>, police said today. The officials said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a 32-year-old mother of three, died from burns on Friday while being airlifted by helicopter to a hospital in the town of <LOCATION> Argostoli </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cephalonia </LOCATION>. Two of <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' daughters, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, 3, also died in the fire that broke out early Friday near the village of <LOCATION> Lakithra </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Ionian </LOCATION> island. The officials, who declined to be identified in accordance with Greek practice, said 14-year-old <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> survived the flames but was listed in critical condition in an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> hospital. They said five other Greeks were also hospitalized with burns. A police spokesman on Cephalonia said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, of Greek origin, had been vacationing on the island without her husband, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. He said the <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> family lived in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The spokesman said two hotels on the island were evacuated and some tourists spent the night on a beach. A Greek woman, <PERSON> Eleni </PERSON> <PERSON> Konstantatou </PERSON>, 82, also died in the fire on Cephalonia, according to the officials. The officials said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Efthimiades </PERSON>, 60, died while battling the flames with teams of firefighters on <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION>. High winds gusting up to 25 miles were hampering firefighters' efforts to put out the blazes on both resort islands, forestry officials said Another fire was raging out of control through the forests of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olympus </LOCATION>, home of the legendary Greek gods in northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alekos </PERSON> <PERSON> Voutsaras </PERSON>, a forestry official at the agriculture ministry said. `` We've got hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and nine firefighting planes battling all three blazes but the strong winds are really hampering us,'' <PERSON> Voutsaras </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The forestry official said it still was n't clear how any of the three fires started or how much damage they had caused. The blazes on both islands broke out on the seventh day of a heat wave that has sent temperatures soaring past 104 degrees Fahrenheit range and has left more than 30 dead. More than 3,000 people have been admitted to hospitals because of the blistering temperatures.

 Oil troubleshooter `` Red'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> boarded the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> oil platform today to try to stop fires still raging on the twisted wreckage, where 166 people died in the world's worst oilfield disaster. <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> was lowered by crane onto the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> rig from the nearby support vessel Tharos in a personnel basket, said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, the rig's American owner. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> hired the 73-year-old Texan to make the platform safe, seal gas leaks and determine whether he can save the oil wells to which the rig is connected. <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has gained fame for capping out-of-control oil wells. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> says it believes a gas leak caused an explosion last Wednesday night that turned the 34,000-ton rig into a fireball. Sixty-four workers escaped and survived. Eighteen remained in <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infirmary </ORGANIZATION>, one in serious condition and the rest stable, the hospital said today. <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> and two assistants flew to the disaster site, 120 miles off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s east coast, on Friday. They have been using the Tharos, a semi-submersible support vessel that <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> helped design, as a temporary base. On Friday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> agreed that the explosion shows major design changes are needed on offshore oil platforms. Hammer, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> met some of the survivors and families of the dead on Friday. The royal couple brought skin graft equipment from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to treat survivors' burns Hammer said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> was donating $ 1.7 million to a trust fund for the injured and the bereaved. The government matched the figure and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> added $ 952,000. The 90-year-old oil magnate told a news conference after meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in this east Scottish port city Friday night: `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> thinks, and we think, that when we complete our inquiry and the government completes theirs, it may very well be that the living quarters for the men may have to be removed from the precarious position they are in.'' Survivor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON>, 35, said 100 men died screaming for help, trapped in the living quarters after they survived the initial explosion. The quarters were directly above the rig's gas compression chamber, where <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> officials say they think a gas leak caused the blast. Hammer said living quarters and production facilities probably would remain on the same platform, but would be separated instead of adjacent as at present. In a statement released in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> confirmed <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> news reports that the rig's gas compression chamber had previous problems, including a gas leak and a fire. But it said the problems were minor, they were corrected and they had no bearing on Wednesday's disaster. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the throne, and his wife, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, were driven to the emergency entrance of the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infirmary </ORGANIZATION> and spoke briefly with doctors before going to visit the injured. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> brought with him skin graft equipment for the infirmary's burn unit to replace a machine that was not working properly. `` It was much needed,'' said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON>, a plastic surgeon. `` We were having to shuttle the only one working effectively round the operating theaters.'' Flags flew at half-staff in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil industry, when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Royal Infirmary. `` I'm amazed at how well they are in themselves,'' she said. `` Even though they have burns and internal burns, their morale is very high. These are people with great inner strength and great capacity to tackle the disaster.'' Hammer said the six <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> employees who survived and the families of 31 who died would receive compensation worth about $ 170,000 each, plus lifetime pensions, and <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> will fix compensation later for the employees of 25 contractors. About 120 workers on British Petroleum's West Sole gas platform in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resigned Friday, saying they were concerned about safety. They said access from the living quarters to evacuation positions on one platform was difficult. But British Petroleum said in a statement: `` We are regularly inspected and have to meet the regulations. If we did not come up to standard we would not be able to continue producing.''

<TEXT>
 An opposition candidate in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s presidential elections said today the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was seeking to steal victory with its demand for a recount of votes in the capital <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> told a news conference that the governing party had petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to nullify voting in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> because thousands of voters had used differing party symbols to cast ballots for <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> is listed on the ballots as the presidential candidate of three different parties. Those parties subsequently merged as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to back his candidacy. The Commission had rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> request before the election that ballots be reprinted to list <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> only once. The governing party's recount request is `` absurd,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said. `` Our information shows we have won in nearly all, if not all, 40 districts of the Federal District. `` I call upon the president of the Republic -LRB- and governing party -RRB- candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to comply with their word and their commitment to preserve the legality of this electoral process,'' he said. Early and partial returns released by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Friday showed <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> with 47.4 percent of the 4.5 million votes tabulated. The commission said <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> had 26.7 percent of the vote and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 20.7 percent. Final results for the presidential election and for the 64-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 500-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are to be released Sunday. The governing party has won every presidential election since it was created in 1929, but this year's presidential and congressional balloting was expected to be the closest in years. The Commission did not say how many of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 38 million registered voters actually cast ballots on Wednesday. The governing party's chairman, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, earlier had proclaimed victory in at least 27 of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states and said opposition accusations of fraud were meant to confuse the electorate. <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledo </PERSON>, a Front <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, charged that the governing party was printing extra ballots to replace those it was seeking to annul. The new ballots would be marked with <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> votes, he said. `` Just Friday morning everyone in the government knew we had won'' the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> race, <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledo </PERSON> said. `` Now they are de-legitimizing everything.'' <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledo </PERSON> also indicated the Front was leading in the states of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morelos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION>. On Friday, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> appeared to be preparing supporters for the party's first federal losses since it was founded in 1929. `` The results so far ratify this circumstance of plurality ... and a new political reality in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said today the election commission had promised not to release any returns until the vote count was completed and charged the figures included results from voting stations where the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it won 100 percent of the votes or did not permit opposition poll-watchers to be present. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary broke the commitments he gave'' not to publish incomplete results and `` released these data without consulting the various parties,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said Friday the governing party may have to concede that <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> won in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morelos </LOCATION> and the capital.

The chamber traditionally has been little more than a rubber stamp for the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` There we're going to see intensely this new reality,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said.

 The governors of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> declared drought emergencies in their states while unhealthy air warnings were issued in the East because of pollution trapped by stiffling heat. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> received approval Friday to spend $ 3.4 million to try to slow the advance of salt water up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and clear salt-tainted drinking water, while a <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said a plan of diverting Great Lakes water to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> might not be much help. Dairy farmers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> were selling off herds at record clips. Farmers in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> made plans to airlift hay to stricken farmers in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Even law enforcements officers had their problems with <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s billion - dollar marijuana crop _ they're having trouble finding it because the stunted plants are difficult to spot from the And the heat rolled on. The national weather service reoported that more than two dozen high temperature records were broken or tied Friday. Temperatures reaching 100 degrees were common over the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valleys </LOCATION> and lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Triple-digit, record-setting temperatures were forecast today for many Eastern states. Much of the central Plains reported heavy rains Friday night and early today from thunderstorms extending across western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The White House said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will go to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on Thursday to talk to farmers, and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, who declared the entire state a disaster area Friday, said he will meet next week with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and push for drought-relief measures. A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators Friday asked the president to send more water from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> into the record-low <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a plan Canadian Justice Minister <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hnatyshyn </PERSON> said that country would oppose. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, chief of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, said while diverting water from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> could raise the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> by 4 to 6 inches, towboats still would be hindered by barge groundings and dredgings. The air quality in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> reached `` unhealthful levels'' Friday afternoon because of ozone, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> said. People with heart or respiratory problems were advised to limit outdoor activity. The problem was expected to continue through the weekend. In metropolitan areas of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and three areas of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> similar warnings were issued Friday as well as in five major urban areas of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> declared a state of emergency in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Friday and put into motion the apparatus that could allow the state to take over water distribution systems. Under one measure, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> is planning to buy more than 10,000 tons of hay in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> so farmers with dried-up pastures can feed their livestock. A 100-car train loaded with several hundred tons of hay will leave <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> within a month, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agreed to fly 300 tons to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> next week free, said <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> `` Butch'' <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>. The hay will be sold to farmers for $ 80 to $ 90 a ton. <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> said brokers seeking to take advantage of the drought have quoted him prices as high as $ 240 a ton. In northeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, hay has been selling at auction for $ 350 a ton, said auction manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprunger </PERSON>, adding `` That's like buying gold.'' Also in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, residents of seven counties announced they had raised $ 70,000 of the $ 125,000 needed to bring <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, Calif.-based Atmospherics, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to the area to seed the clouds with chemicals in hopes of increasing rainfall. Seeding could begin as early as next week, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> official. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the shortage of livestock feed is forcing dairy farmers to cull their herds, a trend that could raise milk prices. If the number of cows in the state decreases 25 percent as some observers predict, the milk shortage by autumn could mean an increase of 8 to 10 cents a gallon at the supermarket, said <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> farm economics professor. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a 16-hour auction in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Thursday and Friday, 1,274 head of cattle and calves were put on the block, double what the auction usually handles, said <PERSON> Sprunger </PERSON>.

 Divers retrieved 13 more bodies today from a train that derailed on a bridge and tumbled into a lake, raising the death toll to 103, government and navy officials said. The divers used gas torches to cut open a last passenger car that could not be searched immediately after the accident on Friday. There had been fears that as many as 50 passengers were trapped in the car when it plunged into the water. But Vice Admiral <PERSON> Laxminarayan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramdas </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed most victims had been found. `` We have searched the entire lot,'' he said after returning from the accident scene. `` It is most unlikely that we will find any more bodies, though there may be odd ones stuck somewhere.'' However, teams of <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> divers kept looking for bodies in the 20-to 30-foot water as far as 400 yards from the sunken wreckage. Railway Minister <PERSON> Madhav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> <PERSON> Scindia </PERSON> today ordered a formal inquiry into the derailment. He told a news conference after visiting the crash site that families of victims would be compensated, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. Nine cars of the 14-car <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> derailed Friday on a bridge over <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asthamudi </LOCATION> near the town of <LOCATION> Quilon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> state, about 1,200 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON>, additional district magistrate in <LOCATION> Quilon </LOCATION>, said most victims died of drowning. At least 167 people remained hospitalized today, he said. Officials had said after the train wrecked that 500 people were injured, but most of the injured were treated for minor injuries and released. Efforts to recover the bodies continued into the night under floodlights, but had to be called off at 10 p.m. because of rain and poor visibility. The search resumed this morning. Six of the brick-red cars were partly or fully submerged in the water, and three hung from the bridge, which is about 15 feet above the lake. The engine and the following luggage car crossed the bridge safely, and the last four cars did not go off the trestle. Fishermen in long, narrow boats were the first to reach the scene, and the rescue official said they saved more than 200 people from drowning. The rescue official said 36 divers from the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Cochin </LOCATION>, 70 miles northwest of the accident site, continued the rescue effort. The railway administration still does not know how many people were aboard the train bound from <LOCATION> Bangalore </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> state to <LOCATION> Trivandrum </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> and about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Quilon </LOCATION>. Government television and Indian news agencies reported that a cave-in on the 540-foot bridge caused the derailment, but <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said the cause had yet to be determined. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a railway safety official, said two spans of the bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as the train cars plunged into the water. Witnesses told Indian news agencies that the train engineer jammed on the brakes just before the derailment. But <PERSON> Subramaniam </PERSON> said, `` It would n't cause a disaster of this magnitude.'' The Indian railway system, second largest in the world and carrying 9 million passengers daily, has been plagued with accidents. According to a report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in February, 227 people were killed in 613 train accidents during 1987. The world's worst train accident occurred in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. More than 800 people were killed when a train plunged into a flood-swollen river in the eastern state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> in June 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> says.

 The pilot of the Iranian jetliner the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shot down last weekend had a 5-year-old daughter who is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen, and family members say explaining the way her father died wo n't be easy. `` She was proud to be an American,'' said <PERSON> Nahy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON>, the sister of pilot <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaian </PERSON>'s wife. The child was born in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> while Mrs. <PERSON> Rezaian </PERSON> was visiting her sister. `` She always said to the other children, ` I'm the American.' How is she -LRB- the mother -RRB- going to tell her that her father was shot down by Americans when she's an American?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said Friday. The Rezaians had two other children. Mrs. <PERSON> Sagedhi </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Kamran </PERSON>, said the pilot considered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> his second home. `` He liked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> very much,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` He had a good time here,'' added <PERSON> Kamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Rezaian </PERSON> was trained in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Sadeghis </PERSON> said because of the increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, they knew their brother-in-law's job had become more dangerous. Even so, said <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON>, she considered his job routine. She was a stewardess in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from 1968 to 1973. `` I'm familiar with the flights. They are all so crowded.'' <PERSON> Kamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1971 to attend the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> and now works for the school as a computer programmer. The couple said they are n't sure who to blame for the incident Sunday, in which the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus A300, which carried 290 people. `` All Iranians do not represent the Iranian government,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` Same with the Americans and the American government. They are following their own policies. I blame the situation. It's the war that made the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to be there.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said her sister has been living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for 10 months because of the fighting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Sadeghis had a strong reaction to early reports that the downed flight was a `` suicide mission,'' with orders to crash into the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. `` No, no. If you had known him, if you could talk to him once, you would never imagine that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` It's not even possible. He was a very good human being. He valued people. He valued people's lives. `` He loved his family, he loved his kids,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` He was very responsible and would never do anything to jeopardize his own life.'' Now, Mrs. <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said, her concerns lie with her sister, and how she `` can survive this with her children.'' She said the children had not been told yet how their father died. The couple said that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offers to provide financial help, the payment should go directly to the families. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays them money, I do n't want them to pay the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sadeghi </PERSON> said. `` If they do, they should pay the victims directly. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs money. Without it, maybe it would stop the war.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official today called for a Sept. 1 cease-fire in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and establishment of an interim Afghan government that would exclude guerrillas or officials under Marxist President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, making his comments a a news conference after returning from the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said the proposed government would consist of `` recognized independent and impartial'' Afghans. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said the new government would be effective Sept. 1, when a cease-fire would go into effect, and that it would convene a grand council of leaders no later than March 1. The grand council is a traditional Afghan decision-making body whose leaders were chosen according to the country's tribal structure. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said he believes such a council would be able to establish a government with broad-based support, while <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s national reconciliation plan and attempts by supporters of the guerrillas to generate mass support have failed The guerrillas did not immediately comment on <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>' peace plan, but a spokesman for a moderate guerrilla group opposed any negotiations with the communist Afghan government. `` We will not have anything to do with communists, any kind of communists,'' said <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He also called for a `` cooling-off'' period in the fighting before Sept. 1, during which the interim government would be chosen. Afghan guerrilla leaders, backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have insisted that they will continue to fight until Soviet troops are out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government is toppled. `` I doubt whether there could be a cooling-off period,'' said <PERSON> Ikram </PERSON> <PERSON> Gran </PERSON>, spokesman for the seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s northwestern city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gran </PERSON> said, however, that he and Nasser-Zia both supported the selection of the `` independent and impartial'' representatives. They suggested the new leaders could be chosen among former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and officials now living in exile. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> Friday from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, where he met with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, other Afghan leaders and Soviet Gen. <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Verenikov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> negotiated the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords which provide for the phased withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin sent troops and tanks into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back the Communist government. In the April pact, the Soviets agreed to pull out the more than 100,000 troops they deployed. Half of the troops are to be out of the country by Aug. 15 and the remainder by Feb. 15. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said 32,000 Soviet troops have already left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said Soviet military representatives assured him the withdrawal was proceeding as planned.

 Faced with its toughest opposition in years, the machine that runs <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is torn between adapting to a changing political climate or clinging to a formula that has kept it in power for six decades. The <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been beset by infighting between old-guard operatives who want to keep the system intact and a new breed led by presidential candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who want to modernize the party machine. The political system now is made up of a huge network of patronage and pork-barrel projects that can create or eliminate jobs, and which provide a raft of favors to loyal party members. Corruption has been a key ingredient in its succes. Under the system, the outgoing president usually names his successor, subject to approval by the party. Other candidates are chosen in closed conventions, and the party machinery makes sure they get elected. The system has kept the party in power under various names since it was formed in 1929. Its presidential candidate always has won with at least 70 percent of the vote. It has held the governors' offices in all of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states and lost only one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, to a coalition that included the party. In the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, it has tolerated a weak opposition. Opponents or opposition groups who became to powerful often were bought off with plush jobs, or gradually swallowed by the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` For years it worked slowly, like an amoeba, assimilating and incorporating opposition groups,'' one old <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> hand, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said recently. As long as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> remained even relatively prosperous, it could finance the party's system and the party kept <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> politically stable and generally content. The bubble burst in 1982, when prices of oil _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s principal export _ plunged, bringing on one of the severest economic crises in half a century Jobs suddenly were not plentiful. Real income plunged by at least 40 percent. One of the engineers of the austerity program was <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, 40, a Harvard-educated economist who served for five years as President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>'s budget and planning secretary. The crisis also brought widespread discontent, and this strengthened the parties both on the right and the left of the governing party. The tensions between the old guard and the technocrats became more visible after <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' nomination for president last year. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> educated technocrat himself, ignored objections from powerful groups and selected <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> as his successor. Many favored <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, and others backed then-Energy and Mines Secretary <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON>, 88, general secretary of the party's power <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the old guard, made no bones of his displeasure when <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> was proclaimed by the party as its presidential candidate. Preliminary election figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> show the party won the presidency by its slimmest margin yet. Early returns indicate <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> won an estimated 47.4 percent, while <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had 26.7 percent and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 20.7 percent. Even before Wednesday's elections, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said in his speeches the party should be modernized to meet the growing challenge of the opposition. The left's apparent success in the elections was spurred by <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who broke with the governing party last year after his push for reforms was rebuffed. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' aides now speak of a `` multi-party system'' for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would occupy an expandable center. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> campaigned for democratic reforms, less state intervention in the economy and the need for `` clean elections.'' Aides said throughout the campaign that he was prepared to sacrifice ideology to practicality in a bid not just to get to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pinos </LOCATION>, the presidential residence, but to get there with some of his party's credibility intact. The major question for him in his first months of office will be how much resistance the `` old guard'' puts up to his proposed changes.

<HEAD>Rebels Vow Revenge For Death Squad Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist rebels on Saturday blamed President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> for the upsurge in attacks by right-wing deaths squads on leftists and human rights activists, and they pledged reprisals. Government troops killed at least 15 rebels in separate clashes on the main island of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and on southern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, the military said. `` The Aquino government and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backers can not escape their full responsibility for the crimes committed by forces of state terrorism against the people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement sent to news agencies. `` At the same time, unofficial death squads have killed a mounting number of prominent individuals who had courageously made common cause with their suffering countrymen.'' it said. The Front, the political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>, said it is futile for victims of right-wing extremists to expect justice from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government. It urged them to support the 19-year-old communist insurgency instead. On July 2, gunmen believed to be right-wing extremists assassinated human rights lawyer <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> was the third human rights lawyer to be killed in two weeks in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. On June 30, <PERSON> Nemesio </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>, a leftist university president, was seriously wounded in an ambush. The ambush, the second on Prudente in seven months, left three of his security aides dead and five others wounded. Police have arrested five <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> policemen and an anti-communist vigilante in connection with <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>'s second attack. `` By its declared total war policy and refusal to heed popular clamor against state-sponsored terrorism, the U.S.-Aquino regime is called to account for these crimes,'' the Front said. The rebels pledged `` that revolutionary justice will be done _ fascist criminals will be punished, the people will be defended _ firmly and judiciously.'' In <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province, government troops backed by artillery fire and four helicopter gunships have killed at least 10 communist rebels since Friday in a bid to rescue five officers held captive by the guerrillas, Col. <PERSON> Hernani </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said Saturday. <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luzon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the clash occured on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tayabas </LOCATION> town in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, about 55 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Soldiers were pursuing rebels believed to be holding five military officers they captured June 1 at a guerrilla checkpoint in a nearby town, he said. In <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province, soldiers killed five rebels Friday in a battle on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> city, 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Calida </PERSON> said. He said 15 rebels were wounded but were able to escape. In <LOCATION> Pangasinan </LOCATION> province, the military reported that it uncovered two mass graves Friday with 20 bodies in the village of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>, about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The victims were believed to have been executed by communist rebels. At least 65 soldiers, policemen and civilian informers have been killed in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> this year in attacks blamed on the rebels, police say.

 The wife of the deposed president of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> sat in the VIP lounge of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s international airport for the fifth straight day Saturday after being barred from traveling to <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> to see her children. The <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> government, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, claimed former leader <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> was orchestrating the protest from <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. He has lived there intermittently since being ousted in a bloodless coup Sept. 3. <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, has been living in the lounge at <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kenyatta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> since arriving from <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> on Tuesday, when she was refused permission to board <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> Airway's flight to <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> authorities advised Kenyan authorities they would refuse landing permission to any plane carrying her. Mrs. <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> refused <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s invitation to stay at a hotel in the capital, <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, and continue her negotiations with <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> officials from there, the <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> statement said. <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> has made several attempts to return home since his ouster, which occurred while he was on official business in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Each time, <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s new leader, army Maj. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON>, has closed the airport. <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON>'s wife was with him at the time of the coup, but their four daughters, ages 9 to 13, were in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nteturuye </PERSON>, reiterated <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s offer to send <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON>'s children to him if he supplied his address and told the government who should supervise the children during the trip. `` The government of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> has waited and is still waiting for an emissary to come to take the children,'' the government statement said. `` <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON>, instead of making a formal request to the government of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, has chosen this sensational method in sending his wife to go on a hunger strike in the <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> airport lounge.'' Authorities refused to allow reporters into the airport to interview Mrs. <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON>. The African Lawyers Association has charged the <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> children are living under bad conditions in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> denies that.

<TEXT>
 Officials today reopened beaches along the south shore of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> that were closed for as many as three days after needles, blood vials and other debris washed up on shore. Federal and state investigators said Friday that the debris that had closed 25 miles of beaches did not appear to be hospital wastes as originally thought, but instead looked like household and boating garbage. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> State </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> and beaches on <LOCATION> Fire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> were reopened today to weekend beachgoers. City Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said Friday that the waste that washed up on a seven-mile beach in the city's borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, causing officials to close it Friday, did appear to be medical in origin But <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said today that the debris seemed to be of `` local origin'' _ or syringes used by drug addicts. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parks </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said the evening tide Friday and the morning tide today brought nothing new and the beach was reopened. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> regional director for state parks, said officials searched <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which was reopened Friday afternoon, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> this morning and found no other waste. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he believed the problem with the waste washing ashore is over. Debris that collected since Wednesday on the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches included fewer than three dozen syringes of the type used for insulin injections, three blood vials, vials associated with the drug crack and some plastic tubing of an uncertain source, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't believe this is the result of illegally dumped hospital waste,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> worker who examined the ocean water from a helicopter. Ice cream sticks were mistaken for tongue-depressors, a carpenter's mask was thought to be a surgical mask and a pair of household rubber gloves used by a lifeguard to pick up wastes from the beach were taken for surgical gloves, said <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellitto </PERSON>, an assistant to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION>, who has been investigating the episode. Eight miles of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches in the town of <LOCATION> Bablyon </LOCATION> were closed Friday for the first time. In addition, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tobay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and six small beaches on <LOCATION> Fire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> were closed for the second day.

 Firefighters dug with picks and shovels today to finish the last three miles of fire line around a 16,500-acre forest fire near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> that stopped growing after thundershowers dampened the area. `` We're looking at 90 percent containment this morning,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>, fire information officer. `` We got some good work done last night.'' Today's forecast was for warmer, drier weather, he said. But on Friday thundershowers lifted the spirits of the estimated 1,200 people fighting the fire south of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> National Memorial. About 100 of the men and women concentrated on finishing the fire line today. `` With the combination of the lower temperature, lower wind speeds, higher relative humidity and the rain, I'd say we got a significant amount of help on the fire,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. Lightning is believed to have started the fire Monday night in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. It spread Wednesday into the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and briefly threatened <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> and the town of <LOCATION> Keystone </LOCATION>. Twenty-seven miles of fire line were complete this morning, <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> said. Smoke from the fire was no longer visible in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION>, about four miles away. <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said one drawback to the thunderstorms was lightning that could cause new fires, but he added: `` If we get some moisture along with the lightning, I think we'll be hitting it pretty good.'' Thirty families living along <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> outside the west boundary of the park were allowed to return home at their own risk today, but the area remained closed to the public. Residents were ordered to evacuate Friday after flames jumped a highway on the southwest edge of the fire. Officials said the flames had burned within 1 -LCB- miles of some of the homes. <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> remained closed to the public with police stationed at the entrances. <ORGANIZATION> Crews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> returned to the park Friday to restore electrical service. Electricity was shut off Wednesday night to prevent any live lines from falling on fire crews, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovere </PERSON>, a company spokesman. He said at least 30 utility poles would have to be replaced.

<TEXT>
 Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> admits he is no expert on the high technology of the Iranian airliner crisis but, after more than 15 years in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, neither is he any stranger to dealing with reporters in times of trouble. For nearly 2 -LCB- hours during the past week, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> fielded questions in the cramped <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing room about such things as transponders, air corridors, black boxes and the differences between Mode 2 and Mode 3 electronic signals. He had been a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> public affairs officer dealing with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> when President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was forced from office. He had been spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> gunmen seized a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner and killed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. He had been expelled from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for his contacts with Polish intellectuals after the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government declared martial law in 1981. He had been a stand-in spokesman at the White House at the height of the Iran-Contra crisis. But nothing in his career had been quite like this. `` It's a very different environment from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in an interview. `` Everybody has an opinion and a point of view, and the place is so big, there are so many points of view, there are so many kinds of experts, and not all those experts agree. ...

<HEAD>Heat Wave Boosting Ozone Levels Over Big Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The heat wave in much of the country is pushing up concentrations of ozone, a major air pollutant, over big cities to levels sometimes not seen for a decade. `` We are having an absolutely horrendous summer,'' commented <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday. Ozone prompted air pollution advisories in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> every day last week and caused standards to be violated in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> for the first time in recent memory. Several states and cities warned people with lung problems to curtail activities and stay inside during the afternoon. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had a statewide advisory on Friday. The new peaks come at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether new ozone standards are needed because of unexpected lung damage under certain conditions. They also coincide with warnings from some scientists that the long-predicted `` greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth has begun, and hot, dry ozone-prone summers are going to become more frequent. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a climatologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, says hot summers _ with `` hot'' defined as the warmest one-third of all summers in 1951-1980 _ could occur half the time in the mid-1990s. Heat speeds up ozone formation. Temperature inversions may trap ozone near the ground and keep it from dispersing. Though in the stratosphere ozone protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun, at ground level <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has defined it as unhealthy in concentrations over 0.12 parts per million for an hour. Ozone constricts the air passages in the lung. It is the chemical than makes your chest feel tight in smog. Three things make ozone: sunlight, oxides of nitrogen from burning fossil fuels and compounds like those found in unburned gasoline vapor, which react with the nitrogen oxides. Concentrations peak in the afternoon and decline at night. The chief weapon for fighting ozone is reduction of gasoline vapors through controls on cars. Some areas require auto inspections and vapor recovery at service stations. The junking of older, dirtier cars has brought cleaner air to many cities, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> lists 68 cities and rural areas as violating ozone standards. The latest research, part of a wave of new findings that started about two years ago, could mean an additional standard covering a longer period like six or eight hours, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, head of the standards section in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s air program. That could take 18 months to develop, he said. Most ozone research has concentrated on peak exposure, but new work shows that several hours of exposure at elevated levels means it takes less exercise to bring on restricted breathing. `` We've seen an effect at 0.08 ppm for 6.6 hours,'' said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> `` Our real concern is multiple hits -LRB- of peaks and valleys of exposure -RRB- ... you seem to get more damage than with a constant exposure.'' Animal studies show that lung damage from high concentrations tends to persist, something the agency hopes to confirm or rule out through human autopsy studies. Some reports from the field: _ At <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> in the southwest corner of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, a monitor recorded ozone concentrations of 0.125 ppm on two days in June `` I'm not prepared to say what the origin is, but the majority has to be interstate transport,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In other words, pollutants emitted in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other upwind points early in the day were still forming ozone after having been blown into <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. He said no one could remember the last violation, but he believed it was three or four years ago. _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, as of Friday had seen 15 days in which the standard had been violated, compared with six expected in a normal year The peak reading, 0.19 ppm on Thursday, has not been matched in nine years. _ <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has had nine days over the standard, compared with an estimated seven in a normal year The city issued its first `` yellow alert'' in a decade, the first step up from an advisory, for readings at three monitors over 0.20 ppm last Thursday, with a peak of 0.223 ppm. _ <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, has had seven days over the limit vs. six in all of 1987 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, technical services supervisor, said, `` My only comment is, Lord, send us some rain.'' But the long-range forecast, he said, is `` dismal,'' with the same weather pattern expected for all of July. _ Five cities in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scanton-Wilkes </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, Reading, <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION> and Erie _ have had readings high enough this year alone to win them official designation as `` non-attainment areas,'' something <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> does after averaging data for three years _ <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, has had nine days above the standard this year, tying the 1983 record _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has had 11 days over, compared with 16 in all of last year

<HEAD>New Rules Tightening Immigration To Britain Start Aug. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new law making it harder for some <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> citizens to immigrate to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> takes effect Aug. 1 over objections from critics who say it is discriminatory and will break up families. Under the law, male <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> citizens living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will have to prove they can financially support their families before relatives living abroad are allowed to join them. The law will require proof that the families have somewhere to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and that a marriage was not entered into primarily for immigration reasons. The Aug. 1 start-up date for the new law, written by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government, was announced Friday by the Home Office, which is responsible for immigration. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposed the law as it proceeded through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but failed to stop it. The bill formally became law on May 10 but left it up to the government to announce when the new measures would come into force. `` This is a shameful betrayal of the promises given by successive Home Secretaries and will cause great misery and hardship,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>, the deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said Labor would fight for immigration controls that respect family unity. The government said the new law was necessary because it was being left with the responsibility of supporting families of immigrants who could n't afford to do so themselves. The government also charged that in some cases, marriages were entered into solely to permit people who would not otherwise be allowed in to come to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON>, a junior minister of state at the Home Office, said: `` The changes ... will improve our ability to carry through the government's commitment to a system of immigration control which is both firm and fair.'' Of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 56 million people, an estimated 2.4 million are non-white, mostly immigrants who arrived after World War II from the so-called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Commonwealth </LOCATION> countries of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION> and their descendants. The Commonwealth is a 48-member organization of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies. Critics said the new measures unfairly target Bangladeshis in particular, the last wave of immigrants of the Commonwealth. In 1961, the annual number of immigrants coming to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> countries reached 136,000. The next year, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> introduced its first controls on immigration by <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> citizens. More curbs introduced by successive governments followed, and the annual number of immigrants admitted to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> now stands at under 47,000, the lowest level 1962.

 Nearly 40,000 people have applied for political asylum in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the first six months of 1988, and the number could top 100,000 by the end of the year, Interior Minister <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said Saturday.

<TEXT>
 In the aftermath of labor unrest this past spring, the government is moving to hasten economic reform, increase supplies of consumer goods and legalize some independent groups in hopes of heading off more outbursts. But some opposition quarters doubt the government will succeed and that more strikes are inevitable. An unknown factor, however, is <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the reformist Soviet leader who is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> sometime soon. Five strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from April 25 to May 10, and brief stoppages or strike threats in 25 more workplaces, constituted the worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law crackdown on the Solidarity independent trade union. The spring strikers demanded the legalization of Solidarity and wage increases to counter price increases of 45 percent so far this year. The rising prices are part of the government's multifaceted program to reform the moribund economy. The program calls for introducing market equilibrium through higher prices, encouraging private and managerial enterprise and reducing central economic controls _ all similar to what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is attempting in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The recent events produced an impulse to think deeper and move faster,'' said one senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist, speaking only on condition of anonymity. `` There is no way back. The only way is forward and forward with much bigger steps.'' The Polish leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, emphasized the need for quick improvements in production in an unusual, eight-hour meeting June 5 with the directors of the country's 41 largest enterprises. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkowski </PERSON>, spokesman for the economic reform program, said the government plans to introduce some steps ahead of schedule. Long-awaited laws on setting up private businesses and easing limits on foreign investment were approved by the government shortly after the strikes and are expected to be enacted by the Sejm -LRB- parliament -RRB-. In one of the first uses of new special economic powers, the government cut off tax benefits for companies that increase exports at the expense of supplies for the domestic market, <PERSON> Malkowski </PERSON> said. On the political front, the government has signaled that it will grant legal status to several independent groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> whose aim is to promote and aid private businesses, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> political discussion club and the dormant Polish chapter of the PEN writers' club. But authorities remain firmly opposed to legalizing Solidarity, an issue that many in the opposition regard as the litmus test of officials' sincerity in reaching an accord. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist said legalizing Solidarity would lead to an escalation of pay demands in the factories, which he maintained <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can not afford in its current economic condition. When the economy improves, he argued, authorities can then think of allowing union pluralism. The answer does not satisfy Solidarity activists. `` The basic question at the moment is whether, on the part of the authorities, there is political willingness for deep changes in the system,'' said <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a historian and leading adviser to Solidarity. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at the moment needs a spectacular change so that it could create a psychological shock.'' Otherwise, he added, `` there is no possibility of launching political and economic changes.'' Legalizing groups like <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> would have been signs `` of extraordinary political significance'' a year ago, before the strikes, said <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>. But now they are `` too little, too late'' because they are addressed to a limited circle of intellectuals and do not try to answer worker frustrations, he said. <PERSON> Malkowski </PERSON> acknowledges that the average Pole has seen very few benefits of the economic reform program so far and contends that is hindering public support. `` Obviously one does not convince people by rhetoric and words, but by facts. This is why I say this year the problem is that we have too few facts.'' The situation should be better next year when, he said, people will see the effects of a freer marketplace and greater competition and supplies. `` Now we have the paradoxical situation in which an item is more expensive and not available,'' he added. `` I think this is one of the more significant factors arousing social frustration. As long as the warehouses and stores do not get filled with goods, society will question the sense of price increases.''

 Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> admits he is no expert on the high technology of the Iranian airliner crisis but, after more than 15 years in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, neither is he any stranger to dealing with reporters in times of trouble. For nearly 2 -LCB- hours during the past week, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> fielded questions in the cramped <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing room about such things as transponders, air corridors, black boxes and the differences between Mode 2 and Mode 3 electronic signals. He had been a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> public affairs officer dealing with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> when President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was forced from office. He had been spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> gunmen seized a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner and killed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. He had been expelled from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for his contacts with Polish intellectuals after the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government declared martial law in 1981. He had been a stand-in spokesman at the White House at the height of the Iran-Contra crisis. But nothing in his career had been quite like this. `` It's a very different environment from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in an interview. `` Everybody has an opinion and a point of view, and the place is so big, there are so many points of view, there are so many kinds of experts, and not all those experts agree. ...

<HEAD>Bush's Vice Presidential, Campaign Staffs Sometimes At Odds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Because he is vice president as well as the certain Republican presidential nominee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must contend with twin staffs. And insiders say the two sometimes-feuding factions have produced an ongoing tug-of-war over policy. A sharing of responsibility for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s daily activity between chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is causing tensions within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> operation, according to campaign officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a committee of six trusted advisers to oversee the broad strokes of his campaign, advisers claim that turf battles are likely to continue until the vacant seat at the end of the table is occupied. That's the chair reserved for the still-unfilled post of campaign chairman, presumably being left open for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` At this point, with all due respect to everybody who's down there, the final decision-maker is not in the room,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign adviser. Although officials in recent days have made efforts to smooth over differences _ including a well-publicized strategy session last week among President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and top <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and campaign aides _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign workers still report some rough going in the coordination department. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is in charge of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign staff and oversees all political activity. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who works out of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential office in the Old Executive Office Building and is on the public payroll, deals with the official vice presidential side of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s routine, including scheduling. However, insiders said that <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> has far more input over the entire <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> operation, including all details of campaign appearances and policy, than organizational charts might suggest. `` Fuller has got the keys,'' said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign adviser familiar with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign operations. The adviser said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> has enormous say on all matters dealing with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule. And these days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule, not surprisingly, is mostly political. `` Often, it gets to be a real bureaucratic problem,'' said the adviser, who declined to be identified by name. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said no frictions exist and suggested that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is well oiled. But officials in both offices claim privately that while <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> make a show of working together, there are many times when one side of the operation does n't know what the other side is doing. Frustrations about a lack of such coordination prompted the former campaign communications director, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, to quit his job in May. For one thing, until recently <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had two separate press staffs _ one answerable to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the other to <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. Now, all campaign-related inquiries are fielded through the office of <PERSON> Shelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new press secretary, who said she has `` unbridled input and access'' to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. One of her first acts was to put a halt to the mailing of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign speeches to news organizations by the office of the vice president _ at taxpayers' expense. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s senior communications adviser, said there still may be glitches, but fewer than before. `` Sometimes, the campaign may seem top heavy. But that's what's required if it's going to work. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant, said that fragmented jurisdiction is not new with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign had a lot of factions. I'm sure it's frustrating for everybody involved, but they both -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Atwater </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> -RRB- have valid perspectives.'' However, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should `` leave the campaigning to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and the scheduling to <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. Then they'll be in good shape.'' The campaign is overseen by a sort of board of directors, composed of <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, media consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> and two close friends of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossbacher </PERSON>. The group meets, sometimes as frequently as once a week, to discuss strategy. According to <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, general concepts of the vice president's schedule are discussed at these meetings, but not the details, which he said are worked out between himself and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, deputy to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said that `` we've done all right so far'' in seeking to coordinate the different roles of the office of vice president and the campaign office. In the meetings of the six campaign officials, `` everybody brings a unique set of responsibilities to the table,'' he said. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is expected to join the campaign around the time of the Republican convention Aug. 15-18. Meanwhile, friction between an official staff and a campaign staff `` come with the territory'' when an incumbent is running either for re-election or for higher office, said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>. `` There are going to be misunderstandings, there is going to be confusion, there are going to be personality battles, there are going to be ego wars,'' <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> said. `` But it will never be as brutal as it is to deal with an incumbent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. Because at least here, the two staffs may be in different buildings but the buildings are only four blocks apart. When you've got an omnipotent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator's staff and a poor campaign staff out in the state someplace, then you have real double grief.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rules out paying reparations to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s government but says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is considering compensating families of the 290 people killed when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shot down an Iranian jetliner. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says `` some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be appropriate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee-to-be, said Friday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> he feels `` terribly sad for the families of those people'' who died in the downing of the Iranian passenger plane by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last Sunday. `` I would never, ever under any circumstances offer reparations to the Iranian government,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He added that he understands payments to the victims' families are being considered by the administration. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said the question of compensating the families is among matters `` under consideration.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there were `` still some open questions'' on the compensation issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> indicated Friday in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that he favors payments to the families. `` I think some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be appropriate,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and likely Democratic presidential nominee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Republicans today via a telephone hookup that polls showing people think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is more conservative than he is are `` crazy, nutty.'' Speaking from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to more than 300 delegates of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a `` card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>,'' while `` I am a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scheduled a meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with supporters of his Democratic presidential campaign. Republicans were continuing their unity rally today in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, scene of the Democratic National Convention July 18-25, and prepared to hear from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former rivals <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader, and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Addressing the Republican rally Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed national defense policy and said `` multilateralism seems to be my opponent's answer to Soviet aggression. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> generally depending on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to maintain peace in the world. At a news conference before the rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, questioned at length about whether his campaign was properly repaying the government for the cost of his campaign trips on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> planes, maintained `` we are not abusing the public trust.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have used tax money on campaign trips, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said Friday at a news conference in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where he questioned whether the vice president can travel in the next month without violating spending limits. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s allegation `` an outrageous charge.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, was still searching for a vice presidential choice and campaigned in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with one potential running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm pondering,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at a rally Friday in <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>. When asked if he wanted the job, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> seemed to play down the possibility. `` I do n't think we have to worry about that,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Friday that his campaign does not have any veto power in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hunt for someone to share the Democratic ticket and does not `` choose to exercise the appearance as though we have a veto over anyone in the process.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, responding to news from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the nation's civilian unemployment rate dropped in June to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent, said the figures masked economic suffering `` National unemployment rates do n't tell you a great deal about what is happening in communities and neighborhoods and regions across this country,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` For one thing, a great many of these jobs are low-wage jobs, many of them paying no more than $ 7,000, $ 7,500 a year. They do n't have health insurance,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of workers clearing debris from the collapse of a department store reached the first floor of the three-story building today but had little hope of finding any more survivors in the massive pile of rubble. Authorities said at least 16 people were killed and 47 injured in the disaster, but six survivors _ four of them children _ were pulled from the debris of the <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` By this time tomorrow morning, the building wo n't be there anymore,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a construction foreman who was leading the digging effort, said this morning. `` We're no longer allowing any tunneling. We're in the process of taking apart the building layer by layer.'' Police Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said rescuers using sensitive equipment thought they heard noises, including tapping sounds, from within the rubble and were encouraged. But later today, <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said the workers believed they would not find any more survivors. `` It does n't sound like we'll find anybody else alive,'' <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said, adding the city had asked for more volunteers to help in the clean-up. `` The crews here are a little bit tired and we need some help,'' <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, an official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that clogged drainage holes allowed rain to collect on the store's flat roof, possibly overloading it. The roof collapsed during a torrential rain Thursday afternoon. `` The roof is not designed to carry all that weight,'' said <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> building inspector <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. `` It's a tragedy and one that may happen again at any time.'' A seven-member unit of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, Pa.-based Special Medical Response Team, which works in mine disasters, arrived late Friday and burrowed through tunnels dug into the concrete, broken cinderblocks, shattered glass and twisted steel. `` Things like this are always tough,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for the team of six paramedics and a physician. `` The process is to shore up the tunnels to make sure that no one else is hurt while we are trying to rescue other people.'' The collapse of the three-story store trapped an undetermined number of people, many of whom were seeking shelter from the rain. The cause of the collapse remained unknown. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said investigations were being launched by the city, the building's insurance company and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said the rainstorm, which poured 2 inches in less than 30 minutes, may have been a factor, but that other factors also may have played a role. `` We have a report from witnesses that a bolt of lightning struck behind the building and hit some transformers and perhaps knocked them down,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. Minimal construction standards and inconsistent inspections also contributed to the tragedy, other officials charged. `` That old store was nothing more than a stack of blocks,'' said <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s tax assessor-collector. `` This was bound to happen sooner or later.'' A 2-year-old girl who was pulled from the rubble Friday after she was buried nearly a day `` appeared to have been protected by some other people around her who are believed dead,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. A 14-year-old girl also rescued was wedged between two concrete slabs. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> of the city's public utilities board called the girl a `` miracle child'' for having survived. Cries from the children, feedback from microphones and seismic tools, and dogs trained to search for humans led the rescue crews to the survivors. Cheers and wild applause erupted from 300 onlookers as each survivor was lifted from the tangle of concrete. A <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> maintenance worker, <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 34, took advantage of his 4-foot-8 frame to snake his way through the heaps of concrete, widening a path for two workers who followed in the 90-degree heat. `` The people were running out of oxygen,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` We ran a little tube through a small hole. Then we made a bigger hole and put in a bigger pipe'' to get air to the victims. Other rescuers dug a makeshift 17-foot tunnel to reach some of those trapped.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> officials and said he discussed human rights with Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> today during his last official trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> and other officials about informal talks scheduled July 25 in the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> capital aimed at a political settlement of the Cambodian war. Earlier today, in the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> for three hours and said the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> leader assured him prisoners detained without trial in <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> jails would be accorded their full rights. Twenty-eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen, the Washington-based Asia Watch human rights group and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to bring up concerns over detentions under <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s Internal Security Act in his talks with <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON>, the two human rights groups said. The act allows the government to arrest and detain people without trial indefinitely. Last fall, the prime minister ordered the arrest of 106 people critical of his government _ including the leader of the opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Lim Kit Siang. He said then that their arrests were necessary because they had instigated racial clashes between the country's Malays and ethnic Chinese. `` The subject was discussed ... fundamentally in a satisfactory way,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, speaking to a news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. `` We took note that 71 people have been released and that the prime minister and foreign minister assured me that that those remaining under detention would be accorded full statutory and constitutional rights and as time went on we would see them dealt with properly,'' said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. But on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Malaysian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> voted to strengthen the security act so that detainees can no longer challenge in court the reasons for their detention in court. When <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> became prime minister in July 1981, about 550 people were held without trial in Malaysian prisons. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where he held talks with the foreign ministers of the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, he was met at the military airport by the defense minister, Gen.

 The butler did n't do it, ruled 12 jurors who deliberated the fate of a man accused by his wealthy ex-employer of stealing two paintings worth more than $ 500,000. <PERSON> Rune </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> `` Roy'' <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON>, a Swedish butler who had been jailed in lieu of $ 500,000 bail since his arrest last September, was freed Friday after a jury found him innocent of two counts of grand theft. `` In other words, the butler did n't do it,'' said <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON>, 62, had worked for <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keck </PERSON> for 15 years, but quit about three months before she discovered a 19th-century English painting missing from her <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home.

<HEAD>Democrats To Convene For Southern-Style Coronation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats will convene in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next week in a spirit of unity and optimism unseen in a dozen years, assuming that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can find a way to have <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on his side without placing him on the ticket. As the Democrats' 1988 nominee-in-waiting, the 54-year-old <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> unquestionably will command center stage in the convention city in the heart of <LOCATION> Dixie </LOCATION>. And a southern-style political coronation it will be for the man from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, from the convention site itself to the selection of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> as keynote speaker and the decision to have <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> place <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' name in nomination a week from Wednesday night. All this from a political party hoping to reclaim at least a portion of the South that has become a political desert in recent presidential elections, with the exception of Georgian <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s Southern success in 1976 en route to the White House. Judging from the public opinion polls, the South remains a difficult hurdle to overcome for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Overall, Democrats have n't enjoyed this much of a chance to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s narrow victory of a dozen years ago, even though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' double-digit lead of late spring has all but evaporated in the wake of persistent attacks by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hold on a nominating majority of the delegates is unquestioned and the convention's nightly two-hour prime time program has been designed to convey his campaign themes, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has reserved a starring role. He'll arrive at the confab at the head of a `` Jackson Action'' three-day bus tour but denies his pre-arranged fanfare will steal the thunder from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` It has nothing to do with thunder. Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no intention of bringing any thunder to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday. The runner-up in the primary season will have the support of more than 1,100 delegates at the convention and almost certainly will have his name placed in nomination on Wednesday night, providing a symbolic challenge to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nomination. A noisy floor demonstration will ensue. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign is organizing a series of events outside the convention hall to maintain enthusiasm. In addition, Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate, holds a police permit for a demonstration outside the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION>, which is expected to urge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to name <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as his running mate. And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s response to the nomination of the vice presidential candidate on the final night of the convention has the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign on edge. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is widely expected to turn elsewhere for his running mate, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides are concerned that rebellious <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces may place their man in nomination and force a prime-time showdown on the final night of the convention, or perhaps even stage a public walkout. `` I think he has been and will be positive no matter what happens,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, a one-time primary rival and one of the contenders to be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides concede they need support from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the millions who voted fo him during the primaries to defeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the fall campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself has provided conflicting clues of his intentions in the five weeks since the primaries. He has criticized the platform, campaigned publicly for the vice presidential nomination and dismissed the other contenders as `` unknown quantities.'' Yet he has spoken consistently of expanding the Democratic party, and when he left <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> earlier this week after spending the Fourth of July with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, `` our interests converge.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he hopes to settle on a running mate and perhaps squeeze in a little campaigning time before flying to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next weekend. The leading contenders are believed to be Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as well as <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> have ruled themselves out, as has <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The vice presidenial issue aside, Democrats say there is little controversy that could seriously mar the four-day spectacle that party officials hope will speed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on his way to the White House. Disputes over party rules and delegate credentials _ forums for nasty disputes in conventions of the recent past _ have been ironed out between the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns. The two sides are expected to continue meeting over their platform disagreements. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides seem to welcome a floor vote to reject an expected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> call to raise taxes on the wealthy and to freeze <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. Unlike the conventions of 1980 or 1984, there has been little question that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a majority of the delegates, and no talk of a convention showdown that might loosen his grip. Aside from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, nearly all of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> one-time rivals have not only warmly endorsed him but campaigned by his side in recent days. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wrapped up the nomination early and also has benefitted from the lack of animosity that has accompanied recent Democratic races. In 1980, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> waged a last-ditch floor fight in an unsuccessful attempt to wrest the nomination from <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. And in 1984, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> struggled to win his nominating majority on the final day of the primary season, while fending off repeated challenges from <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. However harmonious the proceedings are inside the hall, the Democrats will attract the normal complement of street demonstrators, ranging from white supremacists to gay rights activists to animal rights groups. Not to mention a group of Georgians opposed to a four-lane highway to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s presidential library. Republicans will try to grab their share of media attention at the Democratic meeting. They will send several well-known officials to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to make themelves available for newspaper and television interviews. But one group's protest is another's opportunity. Local leaders figure the convention will be worth roughly $ 60 million to the economy. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Tourist Division has sent each of the 4,000-plus delegates a can of state-grown popcorn with the words `` <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Popping. The hope is to entice some convention goers _ and their convention dollars _ out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and into other regions of the state.

<HEAD>Zoning Error Leads 2 Couples To Build Modern Houses In Historic
District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One couple say they will fight an order to tear down their nearly complete modern house that was built in the town's historic district after the town mistakenly said the property was zoned residential. A second couple are considering a similar fight. The zoning board voted unanimously Thursday to deny <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sallah </PERSON> an exception to the zoning ordinance because the shape and vertical siding of their silo-shaped house are not compatible with other buildings in the district. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, lawyer for the couple, said she would seek a second hearing, and will go to court if the board does not change its mind. She said state law says such zoning decisions can only be made by historic district commissioners, and <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> has none. Another couple, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmarais </PERSON>, said they were considering a suit against the town after they were told they would have to modify the ranch house they are building. Their house also is nearly complete. Both couples applied for building permits earlier this year, and the building inspector told them the property was zoned residential. Later, members of the zoning board later acknowledged that the town zoning map was erroneous, but maintained that the historic district and its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> style of architecture should be preserved. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinter </PERSON>, chairman of the planning board who wanted to halt the building, and building inspector <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who favored allowing the building, both resigned over the dispute. The Sallahs paid $ 75,000 for their 3.7 acres less than one mile from the center of the town of about 1,500, and are building the house from a kit valued at $ 50,000. The circular part is two stories with a more conventional one-story attachment. Board member <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brillhart </PERSON> said compensation may be the only solution. Board Chairman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Halla </PERSON> said a decision on compensation would be left to the town selectmen. Selectman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said he did n't think the Sallahs should pay for the town's mistake, but he did not offer compensation. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> expressed frustration with the town's architectural conservatism. `` If everybody had built houses that look exactly alike, we'd still be living in wigwams,'' she said `` You need to allow for change and variety.''

<TEXT>
 The Communist Party has readmitted <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, a major Bolshevik theorist, and more than a dozen others shot during purges under <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> a half-century ago, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> had been cleared in February of trumped-up spying charges for which he was shot in 1938. But the second step in his rehabilitation, restoration to party rolls, was not taken until now. Political rehabilitation had been expected, because <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>'s moderate economic program contains elements similar to those being implemented by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikahil </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> But in today's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announcement, the official news agency said a special commission of the party's ruling Politburo found that <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and an associate, <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON>, had made mistakes. `` However, their mistakes and dissenting positions are not of an anti-party character,'' the commission said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch did not detail the mistakes <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> had made. In the 1920s, <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> favored a continuation of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s New Economic Policy, which permitted some private enterprise and left farms in the hands of the peasants. <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> hoped to encourage farmers to combine property voluntarily and move onto collective farms. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms also allow some private enterprise and families to lease farmland from their collective and state farms and till the soil themselves. Last November, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced that the drive to rehabilitate the millions of victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges would resume. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ruled from 1924 to his death in 1953. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Politburo commission heard a report from the party control committee saying <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON>, expelled from the party in March 1937, were readmitted June 21. The news agency did not explain why it took 2 -LCB- weeks to announce the action. Fourteen other victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges who had been tried along with <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> were also restored to party rolls, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday he sees eight possible explanations for why the cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> shot down an Iranian passenger jetliner a week ago. There is evidence that both supports and discredits each of the explanations, according to Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis. `` The bottom line is that we do not yet have a bottom line,'' he said Pentagon officials are reviewing last Sunday's incident in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, when the cruiser fired a missile and knocked down the airliner and killed all 290 people aboard in the mistaken belief that it was an Iranian F-14 fighter. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, along with other legislators, have received a series of classified briefings on Pentagon efforts to determine the sequence of events and why the missiles were fired. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said the main question centers around <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> claims that the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was receiving signals from the jet on a frequency reserved for military transmissions. Those transmissions led to the belief than an F-14 jet fighter was approaching the cruiser, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials say. According to <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, the possible explanations for the attack are: _ There were no military signals That would mean the ship's Aegis air defense system that detected the signals malfunctioned Aegis has problems, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted, but those problems do n't include picking up signals that are n't there. _ Human error aboard the cruiser in reading the signals <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted that although the crew members were experienced in reading Aegis information, they had n't spent much time in the volatile gulf. _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intended to fire at a civilian plane <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted that argument is made by <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials and he gave it no credence. _ The Iranian plane was carrying a military transponder on purpose, which would have sent the fighter-like signals, because it sometimes used the plane to ferry troops to combat _ The jetliner was carrying a military transponder that was unknowingly turned on <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted that a transponder may have been taken from military stockpiles, but he also noted that there is no previous evidence that such a move occurred. _ The jet was carrying a transponder that was activated on purpose in hopes of causing the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to attack _ The military-type signals were sent from an F-14 that was flying elsewhere in the gulf _ The military-type signals were sent from an F-14 that was flying in extremely close vicinity to the Airbus

 Divers working under 30 feet of water used blowtorches Saturday to cut open a railway car and found 13 more victims of a train wreck in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, bringing the death toll to 103, officials said. The massive rescue operation stretched into Saturday night as divers searched for more bodies beneath the sunken coaches in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asthamudi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> state. At least 103 bodies were recovered, and 167 people were hospitalized, said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON>, a senior official in <LOCATION> Quilon </LOCATION>, a town near the accident site. At least 1,000 police and navy personnel were involved in the search. Nine cars of the crowded 14-car <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> tumbled toward the lake Friday after the train derailed crossing a bridge. Six coaches were partly or fully submerged, and three hung into the water from the bridge 15 feet above. It was n't known how many people were on the train, which crashed at about 1:15 p.m.. At least 500 people were treated for injuries The train had a capacity of 1,700 people, but survivors said it was extremely crowded. Vice Admiral <PERSON> Laxminarayan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramdas </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone, `` It's a ghastly disaster. Today, the relatives have managed to accept their miserable fate, but yesterday it was terrible.'' `` The scenes in hospitals are reminiscent of casualties from a battlefield ... Bruises, wounds, cuts all over,'' he said. Railway Minister <PERSON> Madhav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> <PERSON> Scindia </PERSON> ordered a formal inquiry into the accident. He announced that victims' families would be given 100,000 rupees, or $ 7,142, in compensation. During a news conference in <LOCATION> Quilon </LOCATION>, he refused to comment on the cause of the accident. <PERSON> Latif </PERSON>, a magistrate in <LOCATION> Quilon </LOCATION> district, said train engineer <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> reported that the train developed mechanical trouble. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was not hurt. <PERSON> Latif </PERSON>, reached by telephone, quoted <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as saying that the fast-moving train suddenly braked before the derailment. `` At this stage, we can not be sure if it was human error or mechanical failure,'' <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> said. Several survivors told Indian news agencies that they believed the crew applied the brakes just before the train derailed. Government television and Indian news agencies reported that a cave-in on the 540-foot bridge caused the derailment. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a railway safety official, said two spans of the bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as the train cars plunged into the water. Most of the victims died from drowning, <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> said. The line of grieving relatives outside hospitals in <LOCATION> Quilon </LOCATION> stretched for a mile, news agency reports said. The crash was <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION>'s worst train accident, but both witnesses and officials said fatalities could have been worse without quick rescue work by fishermen and farmers. Paddling dozens of long, narrow fishing boats, they rushed to the wreckage and pulled out more than 200 passengers before rescue workers could make it though the jungle to the lake. The Indian railway system is the second largest in the world, carrying more than 9 million passengers daily. But train accidents are common and claim hundreds of lives Last year, 227 people died in 613 train accidents in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The world's worst train accident occurred in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, according to the Guinness Book of Records. More than 800 people were killed when a train plunged into a flood-swollen river in the eastern state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> in June 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>US Says Soviets Preparing Troop Pullout From Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Intelligence reports indicate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be ready to withdraw up to 65,000 troops from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, according to a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. A pullout from the East European country has long been a subject of speculation here and in Western allied capitals. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has already begun pulling back in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> while Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has announced a troop withdrawal in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who briefed reporters Friday under rules of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would welcome the <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> pullout. He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have already passed the word about it to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders. Last year <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> set the stage for a nuclear missile reduction treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by announcing Soviet short-range rockets would be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The prospective move on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> could be a preliminary step to a Soviet acceptance of Western terms for holding wide-ranging negotiations to reduce conventional troops and armor concentrations in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At the same time, the Soviet leader is faced with growing unrest in several Eastern countries, including <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where economic conditions are falling short of workers' expectations. A recent change in government in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> seemed to indicate <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, in some ways the most liberalized of the communist states, was about to embark on a reform program matching <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika policies at home In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Friday, Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> repeated a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> proposal to withdraw the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from all foreign territory by the year 2000. But the Soviet government chief told Western reporters that such moves could come only in the context of a general withdrawal _ involving other nations as well as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Our proposal is this: let us take out all the armies,'' he said. `` The armies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are part of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact armies. Let us agree on a radical solution in the West and in the East.''

 Fire raced through an old, two-story wood-frame hotel early today, killing three people, as nearly a dozen other fires broke out in this small city in south-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, officials said. Fire officials said arson was to blame for all of the fires except the one that destroyed the hotel which was used as apartments for low-income residents. In addition to the three dead, Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> said one person was seriously burned. Firemen searched the rubble for other possible victims; 20 to 25 people were reported to have lived in the building. <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> said the four victims were males, but added that their identities and ages were not available. Firefighters were kept busy chasing from fire to fire, Fire Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. About 10 fires broke out in garbage bins, brush along fence lines and in another apartment 20 blocks from the destroyed hotel. The fires at the second apartment building were set in a garbage can and a laundry room, but were quickly extinguished, said fire officials. A state fire marshall was called in to investigate the fatal fire, <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Nuclear Power Plants May Have Bought Used Circuit Breakers Listed
As New</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nuclear power plants across the nation may have bought used circuit breakers that were falsely labeled as new, according to documents filed in federal court by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is investigating five southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies for their alleged role in supplying the circuit breakers, which serve the same function as fuses in shutting off power to prevent short circuits or fires. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is unsure where the breakers are being used or what dangers they present, except that they appear prone to failure, officials said. After seizing documents during searches at the companies' offices Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> sent notices Friday to nuclear power plants across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` We are advising plant operators of what we are doing, but we are not asking them to do anything at this time,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingham </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It is too early to determine the extent of the potential problem, <PERSON> Ingham </PERSON> said. Federal officials said the used breakers were first discovered at the <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> nuclear power plant near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> when they failed tests there four months ago. According to court documents, the breakers that failed at Diablo Canyon were purchased for use in non-safety-related areas, or areas that are separate from a plant's nuclear reactor. However, an examination of breakers seized from the five companies showed that it would be possible for power plant workers to believe that a breaker was new and to `` upgrade a circuit breaker to a safety-system use,'' wrote <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director of investigations According to a warrant filed in federal court, the following companies were searched: <ORGANIZATION> ATS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breakers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breakers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnetics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Breaker-Electrical Supply.

 Israeli security forces clashed with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters in six towns and cities today as Palestinians heeded underground uprising leaders and shut down the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. At least 32 Palestinians reportedly suffered injuries from beatings, rubber bullets, and tear gas, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army put the injured figure at 11, saying it included an Arab teen-ager who suffered a bullet wound after a clash in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and a soldier who was hit in the shoulder by a large rock. The violence broke out a day after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched a crackdown on the uprising by ordering 10 Palestinians deported after accusing them of planning a series of anti-Israeli attacks and riots. Today's strikes paralyzed commercial life by shutting shops and halting public transportation in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In one clash, soldiers opened fire at the Aida refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> after several Palestinians tried to grab a gun from one of the troops and one of them threw stones, an army spokesman said. Six Arabs were injured by rubber bullets, the spokesman said. Troops also confronted rioters outside the villages of <LOCATION> Abwein </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, beating and injuring three, including a woman, the radio said. The army confirmed the incident saying soldiers used `` reasonable force'' to detain <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters after several dozen of the demonstrators blocked roads near the villages and pelted troops with large blocks. One soldier was hit in the shoulder by a block and taken for medical treatment, the army said. Troops also injured three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters during a 90-minute clash in <LOCATION> Bani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naim </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. Among the casualties was a 45-year-old woman identified as <PERSON> Itimad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Manasra </PERSON>, 45, who was hit by three rubber bullets and two Arabs treated after inhaling tear gas, the reports said. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers detained 20 Palestinians and beat one of them after a stoning incident in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said an Arab reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity. The reporter said <PERSON> Shawki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON>, 22, told him from his bed at <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> that soldiers detained him at his home after the stoning incident, beat him about the head and kicked him. Soldiers also maintained curfews for a second day on four refugee camps and part of a fifth in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. On Friday, one Arab youth was killed and five were wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The fatality raised to 216 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Four Israelis also have been killed. Underground leaders, apparently from rival factions, issued conflicting leaflets calling for a complete commercial shutdown. Each leaflet called for strikes, but differed on when they would begin. One leaflet distributed this week by an underground Islamic group known as <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> said today should be `` a day of escalation and striking at Jews.'' The army said Friday it would deport six men from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and four from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and accused them of planning and carrying out recent anti-Israeli riots and attacks. The men, aged 23 to 45, all have served prison terms on charges ranging from armed assault to membership in either <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> or the Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, the army said. Both are factions of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> outlaws as a terrorist organization. In a statement, the army gave no date for the deportations and said the men could appeal the orders to a military advisory board or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 21 Palestinians since the start of the uprising despite repeated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protests that the expulsions violate human rights. Friday's fatality was in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tubas </LOCATION>. Troops opened fire, apparently during a protest, and wounded <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kader </PERSON> <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>, who later died of his wounds, a hospital official said. The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the circumstances.

 Republican leaders on Saturday took turns assailing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a rally just nine days before Democrats gather in the same city nominate the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Governor for president. `` If you're undertaxed, vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. If you're overtaxed ... we want you in our party,'' proclaimed Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of several of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former challengers for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., another former contender, said, `` We're not going to run around this country and try to bloody up the But let's contain -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' The rally was the third in a series designed to raise money and demonstrate Republican solidarity. The first two were in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The theme of this weekend's meeting was winning the South. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kicked off the weekend with a speech to a Friday night rally, predicting the South would be solid for Republicans in November. Playing on a theme the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> will use repeatedly in the South, he attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' national defense policy as too reliant on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies and not strong enough on nuclear arms and the Star Wars missile defense system. ` We do n't want to rain on the Democrats' parade, they'll do it by themselves, ` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, evoking cheers and laughter from the partisan crowd. Some of the South's top elected Republicans joined in the rally with appearances Saturday, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, also from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` a mere midget compared to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the differences in experience between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> amounted to `` the tale of the tall and the short,'' using the same analogy as <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, referring to the difference in height between the two candidates. `` Can you imagine the folly of them coming down South and holding their convention?'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national campaign manager and a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native, in his speech Saturday. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said the convention would serve to highlight issues where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record would cost him votes in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, including that as governor he has been `` dumb enough to raise taxes in the middle of a campaign.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support of gun control, opposition to the death penalty, and the problems with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' prison furlough program also would make <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> unpalatable to Southernors, he said. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' indecision on a running mate was `` making <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> look like the rock of <LOCATION> Gibralter </LOCATION>.'' `` After the rest of the public gets to know him -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, this guy could n't get elected dog catcher down here,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` simply embarrassed by American power.'' `` Have you heard him say one kind word about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arms control triumph in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>? he said, referring to implementation of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not attend Saturday's sessions, flying off late Friday for his home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Despite the rhetoric, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> predicted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would fall in the polls following the Democratic National Convention because of all the media attention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will receive. He said most voters would not decide until the final weeks of the campaign, and then voters will move to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when they find out `` what an honest, decent fellow he is.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying that `` the time for excuses and delays is long past,'' appealed to Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today to appoint members to a task force aimed at stripping politics from the national drug debate. In his weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office, the president also disclosed that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> employes were given notice on Friday that random drug testing will begin in 60 days. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recounted the formation of `` Just Say No'' clubs as part of first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-drug campaign among youth, and said, `` I figure if young people across the country can come together against illegal drugs, then why should n't the grown-ups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> be able to do the same?'' `` In May, I proposed that both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, both sides of the aisle, join together with our administration in a bipartisan executive-legislative task force to advance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s uniform anti-drug policy.'' `` If we are going to get the drugs out of schools, we need to get the politics out of drugs,'' he said. `` I believe that partisan bickering or seeking political advantage can only impede our progress in seeking to achieve a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` I hope that the Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will now join in this united effort,'' he said. `` The time for excuses and delays is long past.''

 Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prodded Democrats to get on board his joint executive-legislative task force, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> voiced hope that the appointments would still be made. Asked why Democrats had not yet done so, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Well, we believe they will ... because they've expressed interest in the drug issue, they have said they care about it and would like to develop some initiative. ... `` They're waiting to get reports from their committee chairmen and others who are advising them. I just ca n't imagine, after all the talk they've made around the country on drugs, that they would n't want to participate.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said May 16 in a speech to the graduating class of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> that the national drug policy debate had become too politicized. At the time, he called on Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to join the executive branch on a task force to recommend solutions. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., named members of their chambers to the task force some time But House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, have not named their <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> address that little headway could be made in the effort to combat drug abuse and drug trafficking so long as national debate on the issue took on partisan tones. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did direct the members of the task force to concentrate on strategies aimed at attacking demand for illegal narcotics. The president had said in the past that interdiction efforts would be futile so long as demand continued unabated. The president sent his marching orders to the executive-legislative task force as <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators unveiled a $ 1.5-billion-a-year anti-drug plan that would install a top drug enforcement officer in the president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, deny federal benefits to users and allow the death penalty for convicted dealers. The measure, sponsored by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and 10 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, also would boost the drug-enforcement authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, launch a federal initiative against gangs and crack down on illegal use of firearms. In his statement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` Much has already been done, but there is much more to do. The task force offers us the rare opportunity to lift the battle above politics, to make broad progress with bipartisan policy. ... We must not rest until the message to every drug user is clear: We mean business. No more drugs.''

 The House of Representatives voted to strengthen the Internal Security Act, which allows the government to arrest and detain people without trial indefinitely. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the law Friday and sent it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> today and said he discussed human rights issues with Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON>. Last fall, the prime minister ordered the arrest of 106 people critical of his government _ including the leader of the opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Lim Kit Siang. <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> said then that their arrests were necessary because they had instigated racial clashes between the country's Malays and ethnic Chinese. `` The subject was discussed ... fundamentally in a satisfactory way,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at a news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. `` We took note that 71 people have been released and that the prime minister and foreign minister assured me that that those remaining under detention would be accorded full statutory and constitutional rights and as time went on we would see them dealt with properly,'' said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Twenty-eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen, the Washington-based Asia Watch human rights group and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> had asked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to bring up American concerns over the detentions with <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON>, according to the two human rights groups. The official <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that the amendments passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, among other things, `` prohibited any action, suit, prosecution, or any other legal proceedings from being brought, instituted or maintained in respect of any detention.'' Forty-seven representatives supported the amendments and 18 were opposed. The amendments will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for approval later this month and then to the king before they become law. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is dominated by government appointees, and the king, like <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, is a constitutional head and normally signs all laws passed by the legislature. `` By completely depriving the right of the people to seek legal redress in court, the situation is worse than during the colonial days,'' former foreign minister <PERSON> Rais </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatim </PERSON>, a governing party member who opposes <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON>, said during the parliamentary debate. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1957 and inherited the Internal Security Act from the days of colonial rule. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> Thai, acting leader of the parliamentary opposition, said the amendments would prohibit anyone who has been improperly detained from asking a court to secure his release. Deputy Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Megat </PERSON> <PERSON> Junid </PERSON> <PERSON> Megat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayub </PERSON> said during the debate the government would not abuse its powers and that the Internal Security Act was necessary for the security of the country. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen and human rights groups have called for the detainees to be brought to trial or released. About 80 people now are being held under the act. When <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> became prime minister in July 1981, more than 500 people were under detention.

 Police used mine detectors Saturday to check cars arriving at a <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> rugby stadium as part of tightened security measures following a series of bombings. A mine attached to a telephone pole exploded outside the clubhouse of a field hockey team in a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> suburb. No serious injuries were reported. At a rugby match in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a police helicopter circled the stadium. Last weekend, a car bomb exploded outside a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> stadium as spectators left a rugby match. Two people died and 35 were injured. Other recent targets included a video game arcade and a beachfront restaurant. On Saturday, a large police contingent was on duty at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s main rugby stadium Spectators arriving for the game were searched as they entered the grounds, and mine detectors were used to scan underneath vehicles entering parking lots. Police have blamed the recent bombings on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, which has neither claimed nor denied responsibility. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main group fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government. Authorities across the country have launched a `` bomb awareness campaign'' to encourage greater public vigilance. City officials in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> are publicizing a special emergency telephone number to be used for reporting suspected bombs, and the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has published a set of security guidelines to shopowners. Even before the bombings intensified over the past four months, posters were on display in many government buildings to help the public identify limpet mines, one of the devices most commonly used in the bomb attacks.

 Teddy bears are the newest tool of street-savvy police in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, whose officers routinely deal with armed drug smugglers and other criminals. `` I think these teddy bears will be a great tool in working with children. We plan to stock at least two teddy bears in each patrol car, and we'll start using them sometime next week in 50 of our patrol cars in the <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area to see how it works out,'' said Metro-Dade Cmdr. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diecidue </PERSON>. `` When a child sees a police officer in a negative situation like an accident or maybe a child abuse case, that child is usually very frightened,'' <PERSON> Diecidue </PERSON> said. `` We hope that offering these teddy bears will ease a lot of that initial pain and fright they experience.'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said all three shifts of his patrol units will carry the bears and distribute them among poor children throughout the city. `` We think this is a great idea, and we hope it will bridge the gap sometimes existing between a small child and a police officer,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> radio station WPOW-FM is working with area <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> department stores to collect at least 5,000 teddy bears for donation to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheriff </LOCATION>'s police agencies <ORGANIZATION> WPOW </ORGANIZATION> assistant promotions director <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Alterman </PERSON> said the idea came from a magazine article mentioning that <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> patrol officers carry teddy bears. `` We felt that if the officers approaching a crime scene where a child is involved offer that child a teddy bear to hug and hold and keep for his own, it would help ease a lot of the fear and anxiety that the child experiences at that moment,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alterman </PERSON> said. `` We see it as a stranger offering the child something that's not so strange.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded outgoing Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> today as a `` public servant of dedication and integrity'' whose `` name has been cleared.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office, coincided with a published report that independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation of the attorney general shows that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> initially indicated he may have had knowledge about possibly illegal payments to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in connection with a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced his upcoming resignation Tuesday, the day <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report, which has not been made public, was filed in court. The attorney general said the independent counsel's investigation vindicates him. `` With the announcement by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, now that his name has been cleared, that he will be returning to private life this summer, I would like to take a minute to recognize a public servant of dedication and integrity who has been a close friend for over 20 years,'' the president said. `` As counselor at the White House and as attorney general, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement and to fight organized crime,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which obtained portions of the independent counsel's report, reported today that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was asked in November 1987 by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> about his understanding of a memorandum from longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on the pipeline. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> asked whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> understood when he received the memo in September 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would go directly to the political party. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> asked, `` Was that your understanding in September 1985 that was the arrangement?'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> replied, `` Again, I ca n't recall specifically, but that certainly would be consistent with my understanding and would explain why Mr. -LRB- then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon -RRB- <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was personally interested.'' However, two months later, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> submitted a clarification of his testimony, saying he did n't recall that part of the memo. The clarification came a few weeks after the first news accounts reported that the memo from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> mentioned planned payments to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, constituting a possible violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had been consistent in his statements about his knowledge of the plan to make payments to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> does not recall reading the portion of the memo dealing with payments to the political party and that is what <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> meant to say when he gave the statement to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> in November 1987. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of a bribery plan and that the available evidence is therefore insufficient to conclude <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities on behalf of the pipeline violated the corrupt practices act. The independent counsel said his pipeline investigation was hampered because <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, including <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, were unavailable to be questioned and several American witnesses invoked their right not to incriminate themselves. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also said a sensitive <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about the pipeline was missing from his department files. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had testified he had received the memo and might have shared it with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, said the report. The memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for the financial and security guarantees for the pipeline, according to the report. The memo from a department attorney and written at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s urging recommended a possible solution to the legal problem Department officials were unable to locate it in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s files, said the report. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was `` closely involved'' in 1985 in discussions about building the pipeline. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said the project was of limited interest to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government until <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> made a `` highly unusual'' phone call to the White House in 1985 at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s request. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was representing one of the project's partners, Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> repeatedly has characterized his involvement in the project as limited. The McKay report also said Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> he was `` astonished'' because <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told him that an offer of a high <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> job to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was still pending even after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> learned that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was the subject of a criminal investigation. The report says <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> learned from his subordinates on April 6, 1987, that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who currently is under indictment on racketeering charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, was the subject of a federal criminal probe of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> immediately recused himself from all involvement in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> matters, but subsequently told <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> he `` had offered Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> the position of counselor to the attorney general'' and `` that the offer was still open.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s office he was `` astonished'' to hear this from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> but `` maintained a ` poker face' and responded by saying, ` oh,''' the report said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, head of the department's civil rights division, eventually got the job instead of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday: My fellow Americans, today I want to tell you about some new anti-drug initiatives. But first, with the announcement by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, now that his name has been cleared, that he'll be returning to private life this summer, I'd like to take a minute to recognize a public servant of dedication and integrity who has been a close friend for over 20 years. As counselor at the White House, and as attorney general, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement and to fight organized crime. And, in a system usually focused on the criminal, he never forgot the victims of crime or their rights. As attorney general, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> led our effort to appoint highly qualified federal judges who would crack down on crime and also faithfully interpret the Constitution. He led our <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as it aggressively defended civil rights. In fact, this administration has achieved more convictions for civil rights violations than any previous administration. In fighting terrorism, Attorney General <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> worked closely with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecute those who wage war on innocent members of free societies. And in our campaign against the menace of illegal drugs, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been a central figure, serving as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Now, let me turn to our anti-drug efforts. I believe that drug testing is a key tool to help promote public safety and a drug-free work force. In fact, to set a good example, White House employees were informed yesterday that random drug testing would begin in 60 days. I hope the White House program will encourage increased testing programs in the private sector. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, I have just approved a new set of drug abuse policy recommendations. These proposals send a strong message to drug traffickers and illegal drug users that we have zero tolerance for those who sell or use illegal drugs. For example, we would require businesses and colleges that receive federal funds to adopt effective, anti-drug programs. For pregnant women who use illegal drugs, there should be priority treatment to help them and their unborn children. We would give the military a greater role in coordination with our drug enforcement agencies. Criminals on probation or parole would be drug-tested and testing positive might send them right back to jail. And yes, for for those who commit drug-related murders or kill law officers, we we favor a federal death penalty. Since 1981 when Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I took office, we have better than tripled total federal spending for drug enforcement, prevention and treatment. And we've requested a further 13 percent increase that will put nearly $ 4 billion into the federal effort next year. And we're beginning to see results. Arrests are up, seizures are up, and use in some categories is coming down. But by far the most important development is the change in attitude in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. You can feel it. People are angry about illegal drugs. We're a patient people, but we've lost our patience and this is good news because more needs to be done. And as never before, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are doing it _ in their neighborhoods, through their churches, at their schools and workplaces. For example, today 28 percent of our largest corporations have drug testing programs. Communities are working with police to get rid of drug dealers, and in thousands of schools throughout American, there are now `` Just Say No'' clubs. I have to tell you that whole movement began when a young girl asked <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> what to do if someone offered her drugs. And <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> told her, `` Just say no.'' Well I figure if young people across the country can come together against illegal drugs, then why should n't the grown-ups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> be able to do the same In May I proposed that both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, both sides of the aisle, join together with our administration in a bipartisan executive-legislative task force to advance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unified anti-drug policy. I proposed this task force for a simple reason _ if we're going to get the drugs out of our schools, we need to get the politics out of drugs. And fortunately on the drug issue, there is near unanimous agreement. I can tell you that was not the case seven years ago. But it is today. This is my final year in office, and I believe that partisan bickering or seeking political advantage can only delay our progress in working to achieve a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Yesterday I gave a set of policy proposals to my representatives to the executive-legislative task force. I hope that the Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will now join in this united effort. The time for excuses and delays is long past. I hope that through this task force we can all come together and work in good faith for the good of this country. Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

The search warrant of the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> office sought the same documents. The bidding information, if obtained by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> through <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> during the contract competition, would have given the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company an enormous advantage over <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. Federal investigators are looking into allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. No one has been charged in the case. Tallia and other company officials have refused to comment on the investigation. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that `` since the investigation is ongoing and all of the relevant facts are n't known, we simply are n't in a position to comment further.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> added that company officials are cooperating with investigators and that <PERSON> Tallia </PERSON> remains in his post. The contract to build engines for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-18 fighter jets had been held exclusively by GE. But in 1984, then-Navy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> decided to have the two contractors compete _ a move that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who was then assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary, supported. GE and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lawmakers complained at the time about the dual-sourcing move and <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s decision to give <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> a GE engine to help <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> build its own F-404. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s actions followed <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s loss of its longtime monopoly on engines for the F-15 and F-16 fighters. Last year, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> began winning about a third of the F-18 engine contracts. Union officials have charged that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s loss of some F-18 contracts cost up to 500 jobs at <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s engine-building plant in <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The newly released search warrant also reveals for the first time the government's belief that unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> officials paid <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> during his tenure as assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary in connection with information regarding another contract that the two companies competed for. The document said that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents sought `` information pertaining to <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s support on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>'' for engines to power the V-22 Osprey, a helicopter-airplane hybrid designed for vertical takeoffs. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> was chosen over <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to be the second contractor on that engine. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> resigned from his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> post in March 1987 and set up a lucrative consulting firm. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, one of major defense contractors to hire <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, paid him $ 200,000 a year to consult for the two engine programs, according to unidentified sources quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tallia </PERSON>, 52, a company vice president, has headed <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office since 1979. Before that he worked for 25 years at <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, another operating division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Dog Trainer Barbara Woodhouse Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dog trainer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>, whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died Saturday at the age of 78, relatives said. Her family said she died in a hospital in <LOCATION> Buckinghamshire </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after suffering a stroke a month ago. She suffered a first stroke in 1984. Mrs. <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, said: `` We shall miss her very much but she had been very ill for some time.'' In the 1970s and early 1980s, millions of dog owners in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> watched Mrs. <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON> schooling pets on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television program `` Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way.'' Before long, loyal viewers were telling their dogs, `` Walkies!'' as her byword caught on. Mrs. <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>'s book, `` No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was a bestseller in 1982. She insisted no dog was untrainable and showed they could be taught within minutes with `` tone of voice, telepathy and a little bit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was to breathe into its nose. Mrs. <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>'s smiling, bespectacled face, framed by short gray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In 1980, she was `` flabbergasted'' to be named female TV personality of the year in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON>, said. The Woodhouses lived in <LOCATION> Croxley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hertfordshire </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON> developed her knack with animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learned she could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice. She trained dogs as her three children were growing up and at one time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners. She made her first dog training film, `` Love Me, Love My Dog,'' in 1955 using her Great Dane, <PERSON> Juno </PERSON>. It was shown in movie theaters around the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advance sales of 25,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Woodhouse </PERSON> said she received 400 letters a day when the television program was running. She once told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that because of the television appearances, she could not go out in public without being asked for her advice, but she said she did n't mind. The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, going through passport control at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> airport, the inspector said `` Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday: My fellow Americans, today I want to tell you about some new anti-drug initiatives. But first, with the announcement by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, now that his name has been cleared, that he'll be returning to private life this summer, I'd like to take a minute to recognize a public servant of dedication and integrity who has been a close friend for over 20 years. As counselor at the White House, and as attorney general, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement and to fight organized crime. And, in a system usually focused on the criminal, he never forgot the victims of crime or their rights. As attorney general, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> led our effort to appoint highly qualified federal judges who would crack down on crime and also faithfully interpret the Constitution. He led our <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as it aggressively defended civil rights. In fact, this administration has achieved more convictions for civil rights violations than any previous administration. In fighting terrorism, Attorney General <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> worked closely with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecute those who wage war on innocent members of free societies. And in our campaign against the menace of illegal drugs, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been a central figure, serving as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Now, let me turn to our anti-drug efforts. I believe that drug testing is a key tool to help promote public safety and a drug-free work force. In fact, to set a good example, White House employees were informed yesterday that random drug testing would begin in 60 days. I hope the White House program will encourage increased testing programs in the private sector. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, I have just approved a new set of drug abuse policy recommendations. These proposals send a strong message to drug traffickers and illegal drug users that we have zero tolerance for those who sell or use illegal drugs. For example, we would require businesses and colleges that receive federal funds to adopt effective, anti-drug programs. For pregnant women who use illegal drugs, there should be priority treatment to help them and their unborn children. We would give the military a greater role in coordination with our drug enforcement agencies. Criminals on probation or parole would be drug-tested and testing positive might send them right back to jail. And yes, for for those who commit drug-related murders or kill law officers, we we favor a federal death penalty. Since 1981 when Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I took office, we have better than tripled total federal spending for drug enforcement, prevention and treatment. And we've requested a further 13 percent increase that will put nearly $ 4 billion into the federal effort next year. And we're beginning to see results. Arrests are up, seizures are up, and use in some categories is coming down. But by far the most important development is the change in attitude in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. You can feel it. People are angry about illegal drugs. We're a patient people, but we've lost our patience and this is good news because more needs to be done. And as never before, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are doing it _ in their neighborhoods, through their churches, at their schools and workplaces. For example, today 28 percent of our largest corporations have drug testing programs. Communities are working with police to get rid of drug dealers, and in thousands of schools throughout American, there are now `` Just Say No'' clubs. I have to tell you that whole movement began when a young girl asked <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> what to do if someone offered her drugs. And <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> told her, `` Just say no.'' Well I figure if young people across the country can come together against illegal drugs, then why should n't the grown-ups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> be able to do the same In May I proposed that both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, both sides of the aisle, join together with our administration in a bipartisan executive-legislative task force to advance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unified anti-drug policy. I proposed this task force for a simple reason _ if we're going to get the drugs out of our schools, we need to get the politics out of drugs. And fortunately on the drug issue, there is near unanimous agreement. I can tell you that was not the case seven years ago. But it is today. This is my final year in office, and I believe that partisan bickering or seeking political advantage can only delay our progress in working to achieve a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Yesterday I gave a set of policy proposals to my representatives to the executive-legislative task force. I hope that the Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will now join in this united effort. The time for excuses and delays is long past. I hope that through this task force we can all come together and work in good faith for the good of this country. Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s `` name has been cleared'' by an independent counsel investigation, but a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` failed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, in the regular <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio message, urged appointment of `` someone that can restore the dignity and integrity to this great office'' and lead the fight against illegal drugs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced Tuesday that he would resign next month, saying he had been vindicated by the investigation of his affairs by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report has been filed in court, but not made public. The White House has said the president hopes to nominate a successor to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> during the coming week. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking from the Oval Office, said, `` With the announcement by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, now that his name has been cleared, that he will be returning to private life this summer, I would like to take a minute to recognize a public servant of dedication and integrity who has been a close friend for over 20 years.'' `` As counselor at the White House and as attorney general, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement and to fight organized crime,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

The president lauded <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s anti-terrorism efforts, saying he `` worked closely with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecute those who wage war on innocent members of free societies.'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, speaking for the Democrats, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had failed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> both as a friend and as the member of his Cabinet who should have led a broad-based anti-drug effort. `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, now that the attorney general has finally resigned, I sincerely hope that you will take the initiative to appoint someone that can restore the dignity and the integrity to this great office that it deserves,'' <PERSON> Rangle </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat, who is chairman of a special <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on drugs, said one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s failures was `` not putting together the type of Cabinet team necessary to start the fight in the war on drugs.'' After enumerating what he said were other shortcomings of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said, `` Loyalty is one thing, but when you list those failures of this personal friend, the attorney general, you can not overlook how he has failed to bring together this team to be engaged in the war on drugs.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also spoke about the drug issues in his speech, announcing that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> employes were told on Friday that random drug testing will begin in 60 days. He also renewed his appeal to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appoint members to an executive-legislative drug task force, recounting first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Just Say No'' campaign among youth and saying, `` I figure if young people across the country can come together against illegal drugs, then why should n't the grownups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> be able to do the same?'' `` If we are going to get the drugs out of schools, we need to get the politics out of drugs,'' he said. `` I believe that partisan bickering or seeking political advantage can only impede our progress in seeking to achieve a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I hope that the Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will now join in this united effort. The time for excuses and delays is long past.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said May 16 in a speech to the graduating class of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> that the national drug policy debate had become too politicized. At the time, he called on Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to join the executive branch on a task force to recommend solutions.

<HEAD>Report: Meese Gave Differing Accounts of Knowledge Of Alleged
Bribe Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was `` closely involved'' in discussions about a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline and gave conflicting accounts about whether he knew of an alleged bribery scheme connected with the project, according to an independent counsel's report. The sealed report, portions of which were obtained by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, also calls `` highly unusual'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s 1985 call to the White House about the pipeline, and reveals that a sensitive memo discussing financial guarantees for the project is missing from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s files. The report makes no recommendation that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> be prosecuted but is said to raise numerous instances of questionable conduct and to provide indications that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> may have known about the plan to pay off <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to prevent <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from attacking the pipeline. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has previously said that his involvement in the pipeline was `` limited'' and `` totally lawful.'' The attorney general announced last week that he will step down later this summer, saying the report by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> had `` vindicated'' him because it recommended no criminal prosecution. In an interview aired Saturday, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he could n't comment on the specifics of the document. He was asked about a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> report that said that <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded in another aspect of his investigation that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> could have been charged in connection with his holdings of $ 14,000 in regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock. `` I think it's very unfair, quite frankly, for anyone to leak information that is purportedly in a report that I ca n't even comment on,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> show, `` <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> submitted the report last week to a three-judge federal appeals court panel. Portions were also given to individuals mentioned in it so they could make rebuttal comments before it is made public. The Times published a story on the report in Saturday's editions but did not identify its source. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the portions obtained by the newspaper were made available to <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former lawyer and confidant Executives of the Times have declined comment. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is awaiting trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on a racketeering indictment accusing him and two others of taking illegal payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contracting firm, to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other government officials. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> issued a statement Friday saying he would `` seek sanctions against the person or persons responsible'' for leaking material in violation of a court order. His office refused to elaborate further Saturday. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> did not returned a reporter's telephone calls. His lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said by telephone Saturday from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that he could not comment on the McKay report because it was under seal. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he did not know who leaked the report but added: `` If the order indicates that the document can not be released, then obviously <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> would have a right to request sanctions to anyone who did that. Other than that, I do n't want to speculate as to who may or may not have done it.'' According to the Times account, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was asked in November 1987 by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> about his understanding of a memorandum from <LOCATION> Wallach </LOCATION> on the pipeline, which was to take <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> asked whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> understood when he received the memo in September 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would go directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> replied that he could n't `` recall specifically, but that certainly would be consistent with my understanding and would explain why Mr. -LRB- then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon -RRB- <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was personally interested.'' However, two months later, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> submitted a clarification of his testimony, saying he did n't recall that part of the memo. The clarification came a few weeks after news accounts reported that the memo from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> mentioned planned payments to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, constituting a possible violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had been consistent in his statements about his knowledge of the plan to make payments to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> does not recall reading the portion of the memo dealing with payments to the political party and that is what <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> meant to say when he gave the statement to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> in November 1987. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of a bribery plan and that the available evidence was therefore insufficient to conclude <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities violated the corrupt practices act. Israeli officials were unavailable to be questioned and several American witnesses invoked their right not to incriminate themselves. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was `` closely involved'' in 1985 in discussions about building the pipeline. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said the project was of limited interest to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government until <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> called <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, then national security adviser, at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to set up a meeting for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, one of the pipeline project's partners. `` It was highly unusual for a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officer to request Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officer's friend about a matter of commercial interest to the friend,'' the report said. Before <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s phone call, the pipeline project was being monitored in a limited way by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies. Afterward, members of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff worked diligently, sometimes outside normal government channels, to try and get <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for the financial and security guarantees for the pipeline, the Times quoted the report as saying. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also said a sensitive <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about the pipeline was missing from his files. The memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for the financial and security guarantees for the pipeline, according to the report. The memo was written at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s urging by a department attorney, whom <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had recommended that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> hire for the position, and recommended a possible solution to the legal problem, the Times reported. The pipeline project was never built. It was scuttled in 1986 by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Shaken by the first schism in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in more than a century, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has moved with unusual speed to try to win back followers of renegade Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>. But it is showing no leniency for those who intend to follow the 82-year-old Frenchman, who consecrated four bishops without papal approval June 30 and was excommunicated. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> contends the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has broken with true Catholicism by adopting Mass in languages other than Latin and by taking other modernist steps. Within days of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s defiant act, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> firmly stated that it would not tolerate <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> sympathizers, but it made clear that it hoped to persuade them to be loyal to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> rather than follow <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> out of it. It warned that excommunication awaited those who followed <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and the bishops he consecrated, who also were excommunicated. An excommunicated <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> can not participate in the life and sacraments of the church. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said Catholics would be committing `` a grave offense to God'' by joining the archbishop and sympathizing with the traditionalist views of his followers. The renegade movement claims to have millions of sympathizers worldwide, but the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> says only about 500,000 Catholics turn to <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s priests for various church functions. In an attempt to win back <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s sympathizers, the pope announced the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would permit wider use of the 16th century Latin Mass. Its suppression by the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s was challenged by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and his supporters. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also appointed a special commission to help meet the `` spiritual and liturgical'' needs of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s followers, while keeping them in the mainstream church. Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> acted on the pope's words July 3, celebrating the Tridentine Mass in Latin at Notre Dame Cathedral and announcing that <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION> in Latin would be said in three churches in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> each Sunday. The Tridentine Mass was decreed by Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON> in 1570 and is used by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and his sympathizers. In this Mass, unlike the so-called New Mass that followed <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> II, the priest has his back to the congregation. `` If 12 years ago the church of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> had allowed <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> to celebrate Mass in Latin, in the Pius V rite, surely today we would n't have come to a schism,'' said Cardinal <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Oddi </PERSON>, a conservative Italian prelate. But others view <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s differences with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> as going well beyond the Mass and reflecting the tensions in the church created by the modernizing reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> has accused the church of accepting `` modernism, liberalism, communism, Sillonism,'' referring to a Roman Catholic movement called `` Le Sillon'' that was condemned by Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> in 1910 for its modernist concepts. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> objects, among other things, to the church's openness to other denominations and faiths. The Second Vatican Council formally recognized that other faiths have elements of truth and that their members stand in the love of God. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and his followers in the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION> see <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> II as generating the `` cancer of liberalism'' in the church. Other groups have waved the flag of the council to challenge <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on issues ranging from papal authority to the ban on women becoming priests. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had offered concessions to <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, but the Frenchman reneged to assure what he called the `` survival of tradition'' by his consecration of bishops. Church law allows only bishops to perform ordinations so, <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> says, his movement would be `` orphaned'' unless he acted before dying. `` Those who worked very hard for an agreement are very disappointed,'' said a senior <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The fact that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, a conservative himself, sought reconciliation with the group `` could possibly encourage other groups to push for independence in a different sort of way,'' said the official. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> -RRB- has opened the gates to many who would say the progressives were right and the position of traditionalists in the church will be weakened.'' On the other hand, the schism has produced a wave of support for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, whose papacy now has been scarred by the first major rupture in the church since the Old Catholics split from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1870 to protest the dogma of papal infallibility decreed by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Bishops from around the world have rallied around the pope, stressing the need for unity in a church whose history has been marked by division _ from the 11th century break with the patriarch of Constantinople and his Orthodox church, to the excommunication of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformation </ORGANIZATION> in the 16th century.

 As New Yorkers sweltered through temperatures in the 90s last week, some of their favorite beaches were vacant _ except for a few men and women who picked through tidal debris. The beachcombers were not looking for shells. Syringes, blood vials and other waste had washed up at <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and other locations along 25 miles of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> shore. The workers were enlisted to comb the closed beaches for additional items of waste. Although at first the debris was thought to be hospital waste, federal and state officials concluded on Friday the debris resembled household and boating garbage. Most of the beaches were reopened on Saturday. `` We do n't believe this is a medical or hospital-type washup,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muszynski </PERSON>, the deputy regional administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. He suggested that fears had been raised by the discovery of 145 vials of blood a few days earlier on the shore in industrial <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; five of the vials were contaminated with the AIDS virus. A month ago, five vials of blood were found farther south, in <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The debris on the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches focused attention on the issue of medical-waste disposal, commonly called red-bag trash because of the color of the bags in which it is put to distinguish it from regular garbage. Those bags often contain lab waste, body parts, disposable medical supplies, blood vials, needles, syringes, intravenous tubing and any other material used to puncture the skin. A 500-bed hospital will spend an average of $ 120,000 annually to a specially licensed carter to haul it away, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Raske </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Larger hospitals which treat many AIDS patients often pay twice as much. <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> then must take the trash to high-tech incinerators capable of burning the waste at temperatures of more than 2,000 degrees and up and pay anywhere from 50 cents to 90 cents a pound to burn it. Most of these incinerators are far from the trash's point of origin, some as far away as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, resulting in added trucking costs. This, state environmentalist spokesman R.W. <PERSON> Groneman </PERSON> says, is an invitation to the `` midnight dumper.'' Carters can either undercut their competition or raise profits by promising to abide by the law, then dumping the refuse at sea or on land. `` As we apply tighter and tighter standards on managing garbage, we're also making it more costly and as a result we're getting a lot of illegal dumping,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> assistant administrator of solid waste. Though the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has seen isolated incidents elsewhere, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> says it's `` nothing like what we've seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which have very stringent laws concerning garbage.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, all potentially infectious waste must be burned in special incinerators. Outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, all other medical waste can be buried in landfills. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, however, all medical waste must be burned. If medical trash is traced back to a particular hospital, they face fines of up to $ 25,000, even if it was illegally dumped by the carter. Though <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> laws are less definitive, a bill is currently pending in that state's <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to monitor how hospitals and haulers dispose of potentially infectious waste. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said environmental advocates have been pushing for a national law committing red-bag haulers and facilities to a `` cradle-to-grave paper trail'' like the manifest system used in hauling hazardous waste. Proponents argue it would stem illegal dumping, but <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said it would be inefficient to impose a nationwide law when it's generally a two-state problem

 The Iranian airliner shot down a week ago was a victim of confusion that arises in modern regional wars about the right of passage in battle zones. The problem led many airlines to shift routes away from the busy <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> air corridors years ago. Some that still fly over the gulf have altered their flight paths since a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> down last Sunday, killing all 290 people aboard. <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> must continue flying over the gulf, but its planes are taking routes that avoid the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, where missiles fired by the cruiser USS Vincennes destroyed Flight 655. It left the military-civilian airport at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> on the short flight to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and USS <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> sank two Iranian attack boats and damaged another in a skirmish in the narrow strait. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 fighter. `` The particular problem is the commingling of civil traffic and a war zone; when you put these two factors together, you're creating a time bomb from the safety standpoint,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, a cargo pilot who flies the gulf How civilian aircraft can avoid military confrontations was the main topic at a weekend meeting of technical experts from six major airlines operating passenger flights in the gulf region. It was held at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. In their efforts to protect the sea lanes, naval vessels sometimes disrupt those in the air. Charter pilots and journalists who monitor gulf radio traffic say <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels often urge aircraft to leave assigned flight paths to avoid the warships, and declare no-go areas of up to several miles for light aircraft. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> air controller as saying one such order would have put two aircraft on a collision course but that the jetliner told to alter its path ignored the order. <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has no legal right to order pilots off courses assigned by air controllers. But he said if a military vessel warned him to change course, `` I'm going to do what the warship tells me to do. I have great respect for the air traffic controllers, but the air traffic controllers do n't control any missiles. The warships do.'' He added, however: `` For the most part, its is possible to go out in the gulf and fly down the airways and not see any -LRB- war -RRB- ships.'' The cargo pilot noted that the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired when the Iranian airliner was only minutes away. Pentagon officials said the ship detected military radar responses from the Airbus, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denies it carried a military transponder. `` They have a difficult mission,'' <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> said of warships trying to protect themselves and commercial shipping, but `` it's largely incompatible with the needs of civil aviation transportion in the region.'' The Khaleej Times in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION> said in an editorial Friday that air traffic authorities `` should meet on an emergency basis and work out a system that lessens the strain on pilots and the possibility of error.'' On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the tragedy. He said the Iranian boats `` began the shooting.'' It is not clear whether Iranian air officials were aware of the battle in the strait below the airliner's flight path. Diplomats and military observers say the speedboats sometimes appear to operate under local command. The gulf, a transit point for flights from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is one of the world's busiest air traffic regions. More than 4 million passengers used <ORGANIZATION> Dubai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> last year. Flight 655 was following a route most international carriers abandoned years ago because of the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmadyan </PERSON>, deputy senior air traffic controller at <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, said only <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air still uses the route. Most other airlines now avoid the war zone by flying up the gulf around <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or bypassing the tense Strait of Hormuz and approaching <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> across the horn of land occupied by <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> did not announce a route change for flights from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, but British journalist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> was on the first one after the Sunday flight. He said it took a circuitous route and approached <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> from the west.

 The expansion of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval power in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> has failed to curtail attacks on merchant shipping or to promote negotiations to end the bloody eight-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Leading members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are restive, their concern heightened by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destruction of an Iranian commercial jetliner last Sunday that killed all 290 people aboard. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has unilaterally assumed the role of policeman in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our naval forces are protecting shipping in some of the world's most congested waterways, and under heavily trafficked skies.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, after initially calling the disaster an `` act of murder,'' toned down its rhetoric but renewed its demand for the immediate withdrawal of the 18 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships that now patrol the Gulf, with license to open fire on Iranian planes and helicopters that threaten 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers or any other neutral shipping. A number of Arab countries normally hostile to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have condemned the downing of the plane despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurances that it was an accident. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has persisted in defining as his main aim in the gulf protecting `` the right of navigation in international waters,'' and his policy has the support of a number of allies and prominent Americans. `` I happen to think it's correct,'' said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s national security adviser. `` It's designed to keep the Russians out and to keep the Iranians from winning That's the purpose of the policy and that has not been altered by the tragedy.'' The 18 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships keeping an eye on the 7.7 million barrels a day of oil that pass through the tense <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> are backed up by the carrier <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON> and seven other American vessels, including the cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which shot down the Iranian Airbus. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has fired on Iranian helicopters and destroyed oil installations and been the victim of collisions with mines and a tragedy second in scope only to the Airbus disaster: the May 17, 1987, misdirected attack by an Iraqi war plane that killed 37 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors aboard the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark. Ironically, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s presence tilts in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s favor even though the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's stated policy is one of neutrality between the gulf combatants. By protecting the Kuwaiti and other merchant ships, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeks to curb <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s ability to conduct a `` tanker war'' as a pressure tactic against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and its Arab allies In the meantime, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has not bowed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that it enter negotiations and attacks on ships in the volatile gulf region have increased. According to the Center for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group, there have been 184 attacks on commercial vessels in the area since last July 22, when the first convoy of Kuwaiti tankers carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags moved through the gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> carried out 104 of the attacks and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 80, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarten </PERSON> of the Center said. Over the same period a year earlier, there were 115 attacks: 52 by the Iranians and 63 by the Iraqis. Sen. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> urged consideration of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval peace-keeping force to protect nonbelligerent shipping in the gulf. `` It could enhance gulf security while reducing risk of future tragedies,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. The proposal has the endorsement of <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, secretary of state in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, and <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former undersecretary. Another former undersecretary of state, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> called the reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers an example of `` the vice of unilateralism'' and said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should have accepted a Soviet proposal for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval forces. The proposal was rejected `` and now we see the consequences of that,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., a member of the Foreign Relations committee, suggested a varied approach He said in an interview Friday <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships should protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> merchant vessels, British warships protect their nation's cargoes, and so on. `` What we've had is a great escalation, and we only get 10 percent of our oil from the gulf, and a tilt toward <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. With the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admittedly in a combat zone, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should formally invoke the War Powers Act giving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the power to decide whether the warships should remain there. This concern was clearly heightened by the downing of the Iranian jetliner. But even last November, the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> warned: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seriously risks being drawn into war in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Although the stated purpose of the large American fleet in the region is narrowly defined _ to escort U.S.-flagged vessels through the gulf _ this mission, given the circumstances, is dangerously nebulous.'' On the diplomatic front, a year ago Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> led a successful drive in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for adoption of a cease-fire resolution. But he has failed to persuade the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to promise not to use their veto powers to block a follow-up resolution to impose an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for refusing to negotiate with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. As a result, the cease-fire resolution is an empty statement of principle. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has sent a number of `` probes'' to the administration, and in the wake of last Sunday's disaster the White House and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revealed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> entreaties to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to talk about ending the war and freeing the nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> held by pro-Iranian forces. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should now take advantage of whatever diplomatic opportunities the situation may present `` Ironically, this is the kind of event that may offer some possibilities for a push toward settlement,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Saturday'' program Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> sent a message last April through <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> expressing hopes for a meeting. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was unable to confirm that the probes were `` authoritative'' and had the support of the entire Iranian government. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s message last Sunday of `` deep regret'' contained an offer to work jointly to end the war. So far, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has not replied.

 Computer whiz <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON>, whose divorce was finalized this month, is suing his former wife for slander following the exchange of numerous bitter accusations between the couple. <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON>, 37, co-founder of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, seeks unspecified damages from <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON> Diddo </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, in the lawsuit filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He complains in the suit that his former wife's widely reported allegations about his behavior on two occasions accused him of `` committing the crime of assault and battery'' and of `` being an unfit father and one who had treated his own baby son with a callous disregard.'' `` I do n't know why he hates so much, but that's what it sounds like,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON> said after the suit was filed. `` Maybe it's guilt because he left his pregnant wife. Divorce papers in the couple's seven-year marriage were finalized earlier in the week, although custody and property arrangements have still to be worked out, according to <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON>. Weeks after <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON> filed for divorce in April 1987, his wife announced that she was pregnant with their third child. One of the issues in their break-up was that he wanted more children.

<HEAD>Unions Point To Firings, Suspensions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> union leaders say a new safety agreement with the carrier could be a sign of progress, but add that tense labor-management relations will improve more if the high number of firings and suspensions is reduced. `` We've had five terminations this week, so nothing has abated,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Currier </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> local representing 7,000 flight attendants. The rate of firings `` is far higher than it was last year, and far higher than it was before -LRB- Frank -RRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. `` It would be one of the most meaningful areas for improvement.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took over Eastern more than two years ago, inheriting some $ 2.5 billion in debts and a recent history of labor-management conflict. At the district office of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest with 12,000 mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp workers, union officials keep detailed charts tracing the steady rise of disciplinary measures, particularly firings, since the takeover `` Our big concern is the unjust terminations. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> talks about mending fences, but I do n't think the word has filtered down to his front-line management, who keep burning bridges,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacino </PERSON>, a Machinists general chairman. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would n't comment on the safety agreement announced Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> beyond a statement from President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>. While Bakes praised the agreement as important to separating safety from other issues, he said a `` missing link'' remains until contract negotiations are completed with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who have been in federal mediation for seven months, and the pilots, with whom talks started about a month ago. Former Labor Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, who brought the two sides together in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said battling between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management and its union leadership threatens the carrier's survival. `` It is the commitment of labor and management leaders which will make or break this effort,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, this presents some cause for concern.'' `` All observers have said when looking at this that they've never seen anything this severe and such shrill treatment between management and labor _ maybe going back to the'40s and the coal miners,'' said veteran Machinists leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> The agreement calls for more outside, impartial scrutiny, increased communications between labor and management, and promises no reprisals against employees who point out safety problems. The Machinists claim that employees who balked at hurry-up work have been disciplined; in addition, workers have been fired for insubordination, refusing to work excessive overtime or for union activities. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union has had 41 shop stewards fired in the last two years. This year, 129 Machinists have been fired so far, compared to 157 in the first six months of 1987, the union says. The Machinists say they have fared well in grievances, winning back pay and reinstatement in a majority of cases. But the grievance procedures are backlogged more than a year, they say. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing 3,500 Eastern pilots, has had a different problem: many of its pilots have gone to other airlines or left the industry entirely because of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s tense situation and uncertain future. Pilots spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said nearly 1,000 pilots will have left <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> since 1986 by the end of this summer, according to projections. `` You're talking about 25 percent. Without the pilots, these planes are taco stands,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. Pilots last year launched a MaxSafety program in which they highlighted alleged safety laxity and took their complaints into congressional hearings. Eastern has said toughened absenteeism policies and increased discipline are part of efforts to correct years of worker abuses that have driven up costs. Management has indicated it still believes cuts in labor costs are essential. This spring, federal officials conducted special inspections of aircraft flown by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. They also examined <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s management and finances. They said that they found no unsafe conditions but warned of possible safety problems because of the labor-management battles.

 Here is the text of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address, given by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. I'm Representative <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Mr. President, now that <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has finally resigned as acting attorney general, you now have the opportunity to appoint a person that can restore the dignity and integrity that the office rightfully deserves. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> not only let you down as a personal friend, Mr. President, but when you made him your personal coordinator in the war against drugs, there was no strategy, there was no policy. In short, there was no war. You appointed <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to head up your Drug Policy Abuse Board composed of your highest ranking Cabinet officials. And yet, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, he let us down. With every major drug-producing country having bumper crops year after year, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has never been able to persuade our Secretary of State to even place drugs on our foreign policy agenda. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, communism, terrorism, arm controls _ we've all heard the eloquence of our outspoken secretary of state But even today, we've yet to hear one word from Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on narcotics control, as we see drug-traffickers assassinate international leaders, plunder and corrupt governments, and even hold fragile democracies in our own hemisphere hostage. Even when you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, admitted that narcotic abuse and trafficking was a threat to our national security, it was n't enough to get former Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> or now Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to pitch in and lend their support with the multi-trillion dollar technology we've invested in our military to back up and to support our Border Patrol, our <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, and Customs officials. Surely Mr. President, the protection of our borders and shores against the intrusion of this deadly epidemic-causing poison warrants the support of our sophisticated military leadership. Mr. President, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and your Drug Policy Board has never been able to get Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> _ <ORGANIZATION> Secretary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bennett </ORGANIZATION> _ to get beyond `` just saying no.'' `` No'' to preventive program, `` no'' to educational programs, and even `` no'' to our local and state governments as we try to give assistance to formulate their own programs. Today we have no health programs designed for drug abusers from the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. We do n't have any health policy that encourages research and treatment modalities to share with private and public health providers. And throughout these great <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in this possession, we do n't even have one federal rehabilitation center to serve as a model for our nation. As Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was conducting a war against drugs, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, he certainly needed more than a Drug Enforcement Agency that although these are hard-working, dedicated agents that we only have 2,800 agents to cover the entire <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the foreign countries that allow their presence. Mr. President, the local and state law enforcement officials know that the federal government ca n't do this job alone. They have been in the trenches for nearly eight years, outnumbered, outarmed, but always on the job. But they've never been invited as full-time partners in this so-called war against drugs. Every budget that has been projected by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide for federal assistance to these dedicated officials have been rejected or resisted by you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, your <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, and yes, your attorney general. Now Mr. President, even after seven-and-a-half years, we can start anew. You can now appoint an attorney general that will work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to help us to prepare legislation that can truly make a national war against drugs, and that can make all Americans proud. The ever-mounting increase of narcotics that's entering our classrooms and even our boardrooms indicate that this is not a local issue, and certainly it ca n't be considered a Democratic or Republican issue. Let us know, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, now that as late as it is, we can appoint an attorney general that will work with Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislative team headed by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, and Republican Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michels </PERSON> that can fashion a bill and a policy that makes some sense. For those of us that are faint at heart and who believe that we can win this war by legalizing drugs, let them be on notice, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, that this battle can and shall be won. We ca n't do it just by slogans. We ca n't do it by throwing up our hands in frustration and despair, but we can begin to get started by stop blaming each other and coming together and working together in a joint effort. With your new attorney general we can start a new relationship. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ca n't do this job alone. It's not too late for us together to provide the resources, the programs, but most of all, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the leadership to get the job done. Thank you.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> restored <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>'s membership Saturday, completing the rehabilitation of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s old comrade 50 years after <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had him shot as a spy for opposing the dictator's policies Retrieving <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>'s memory from disgrace is part of the effort by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to clear the names of dozens of people who became <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims after helping lead the 1917 Bolshevik revolution and form the Soviet state. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> policy-making </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> readmitted <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, another old <ORGANIZATION> Bolshevik </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON>, and 14 other people. Millions of Soviet citizens heard the announcement on state television's evening news program. The rehabilitations began Feb. 4, when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cleared <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and the others of the charges for which they were executed or imprisoned. Many articles examining <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and his policies have appeared in the Soviet press. In <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>'s case, rehabilitation has special significance because it implies endorsement of his opposition to the harsh policies with which <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> forced the industrialization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the collectivization of agriculture. It answers an emotional plea he made for rehabilitation before he was shot in 1938. In it, he said: ` Know, comrades, that on the banner which you will carry in your victorious march to communism, there is a drop of my blood.'' <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> also incurred <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s displeasure by advocating a greater role for voluntary work cooperatives, more individual enterprise and other policies resembling reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promoted. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> noted in a speech Nov. 2, however, that <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> regarded <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> as not `` fully Marxist'' and said rapid develolpment of Soviet industry and agriculture had been necessary. Saturday's announcement praised <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> for helping build communism. It said they took `` dissenting positions in the determination of courses and methods of socialist construction'' but added that the `` mistakes and dissenting positions are not of an anti-party character.'' Since gaining power in March 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has attacked <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for his `` cult of personality,'' tried to dismantle much of the central bureaucratic structure <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> built and acknowledged that innocent people suffered under the dictator's terror. In the November speech, he announced a resumption of the effort begun by <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> 30 years ago to rehabilitate the millions of victims. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference July 1, in a reference to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges, that it is important to `` restore justice with regard to the victims of lawlessness'' and it is the party's `` political and moral duty'' to do so He endorsed building a monument to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> restored the party memberships June 21, but the agency did not explain why the action was not announced for more than two weeks. <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> were allies in 1926, two years after <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s death, in the power struggle with <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>. Two years later, with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> firmly in control, <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> were branded leaders of a `` rightist deviation'' in the party and <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> was labeled a `` falsifier of Marxism.'' They were stripped of their party posts in the ensuing years. On June 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed the convictions of three other <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> who perished under Stalin: <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Radek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> has not been rehabilitated. He was accused of leading an anti-Soviet plot and murdered in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1940, apparently on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s orders. On June 17, Soviet historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> be exonerated of criminal charges and his writings be published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports 2,000 More Cuban Troops In Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Portuguese newspaper reported Saturday that 2,000 Cuban troops have been sent to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to bolster government defenses near the border with <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The independent weekly Expresso quoted unidentified reliable sources as saying the Cubans, described as experts in mounting and firing missiles, landed in the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony in June. The newspaper said the reinforcements were sent to strengthen the position of the Marxist Angolan government and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in negotiations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end the 13-year civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The reinforcements arrived shortly before a second round of peace negotiations between the four countries in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Lower level delegations scheduled more talks Monday and Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a separate story, Expresso quoted unidentified diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> as saying <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> forces had mounted a defensive line involving 26,000 men in the south of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, close to South African-administered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have acknowledged that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> began sending reinforcements of elite troops to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in November to help the 35,000 Cuban soldiers already stationed there contain South African advances in the south. Western analysts believe those reinforcements brought the number of Cubans in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to about 46,000. Expresso claimed the Cuban reinforcements were creating differences between the Angolan government and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Last week, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON>, the chief Cuban negotiator at the peace talks, strongly denied any rift. He told a news conference in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> all military decisions were made by the Angolan government. South African troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> support guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, also backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who have been fighting since 1975 to force the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> - and Cuban-supported government to share power A peace settlement turns on securing a withdrawal of foreign troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and implementing a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution to make <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independent.

<TEXT>
 The death toll from a weeklong heat wave rose to 56 Saturday, officials said. Forest fires blamed in part on the heat raged across <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and killed four people, including three British tourists. Temperatures topped 104 degrees Saturday in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and hit 109 degrees in the northern Greek city of <LOCATION> Larissa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> said more than 3,600 people have been admitted to hospitals, and hospital officials reported 25 more heat-related deaths Saturday. `` In the past 24 hours, we've had six heat-related deaths in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>,'' said a center spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. Nineteen other deaths were reported in other parts of the country. On the western resort island of Cephalonia, a forest fire burned out of control for a second day, leaving four people dead, including a woman from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and her two daughters, police said. <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 32, and daughters <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, 3, died of burns Friday after the fire broke out near the village of <LOCATION> Lakithra </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. A 82-year-old Greek woman, <PERSON> Eleni </PERSON> <PERSON> Konstantatou </PERSON>, also died in the blaze and eight people were injured, the spokesman said. `` The fire's now burning on five fronts and has destroyed thousands of acres of pine forest and olive orchards,'' the spokesman said. Other fires broke out across central and southern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and on the islands of <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION> and Chios, forestry officials said. Blistering temperatures sent thousands of Athenians fleeing to beaches surrounding the capital. Several hundred people camped in an air-conditioned stadium in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' port of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> to escape the heat. The weather service predicted temperatures would fall into the 90s Sunday. `` Our forecasts show that from tomorrow we'll have normal temperatures for this time of year and we'll be able to forget this nightmare,'' a weather bureau spokesman said.

<HEAD>Lockheed Closing Plant Opened in Wake of 1965 Watts Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The closing of a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant will end one of the few successful efforts by a major employer to create jobs in the impoverished <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> neighborhood following the 1965 riots. The Watts-Willowbrook plant, which makes parts for the C-5 cargo plane, will close by October when work on the C-5 is completed, the company said Friday. The plant is on the city's south side, about 8 miles from downtown. Of the plant's 117 workers, 78 have enough seniority to qualify for transfers to the company's <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> plant, about 20 miles away. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> said it will attempt to find employment for the rest with other aerospace firms. A <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company had expected to use the plant for other work after the completion of the C-5 program, but <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft business has been dwindling and no suitable projects could be found. `` We had hoped that <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> would be able to feed more work to Watts-Willowbrook,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Molli </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` We want to see that the workers are taken care of. Former <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotchian </PERSON> recalled in a recent interview that the company's decision to open the plant four years after the devastating riot was considered controversial. `` I had my own people take issue with me,'' <PERSON> Kotchian </PERSON> said. `` They said I was going to spend a lot of money and the place was going to be run down and there was going to be thievery and muggings at the plant. None of it came to pass.'' Instead, the plant matched the productivity and efficiency of most Lockheed factories, he said. The arrest of a black man by a state highway patrol officer on Aug. 11, 1965, touched off a week of rioting that turned <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> into a national symbol of racial strife. Thirty-four people died in the riot and 4,000 people were arrested. Damage from the six days of looting, fires and shooting reached $ 40 million. <ORGANIZATION> DV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a smaller aerospace company that has operated in <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> for 30 years, plans to take over <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s 25-year lease on the factory, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group formed after the riot. The company expects to double its 55-person work force over the next year and will give hiring preference to former <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> workers, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>, DV's executive vice president. <ORGANIZATION> DV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held company with sales under $ 10 million per year, inspects and paints aircraft parts for <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and other aerospace firms.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opposition's strong showing in presidential elections marks a watershed in Mexican politics _ a transition from 59 years of a one-party system and the awakening of a long passive electorate, political analysts say. Early returns indicated that <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, would finish with no more than 52 percent of the vote, party officials say. That is far below the 70 percent the party had considered the minimum. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> has not lost a presidential, gubernatorial or senate race since it was founded in 1929. Partial returns have shown <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> leading with 47.8 percent of the vote. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials appeared willing to concede that <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would finish better than original polls indicated. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, conceded <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> had likely lost in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, the Federal District, and adjoining <LOCATION> Morelos </LOCATION> state and probably in the state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> metropolitan area accounts for about 20 percent of the 38 million registered voters. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s parties said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> lost, and they claimed widespread fraud. The voter turnout and final results were not expected until Sunday, but partial results were leaked in an attempt to defuse allegations of manipulation of the vote. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> insisted on a small but credible margin of victory rather than the frequently fraud-tainted results the party is known for. But the almost certain loss of congressional seats and the opposition entry into the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the first time is hard for the party's old guard. `` Psychologically, it means a big blow,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, a Mexican economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` Politically, just imagine the slice of people they have to cut. This chunk of votes means many <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> candidates. It's going to be disastrous for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>.'' Political analyst <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> did much better than expected, particularly in urban areas. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who has said he wants to modernize <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, will owe his vote `` to the poorest, most backward peasantry of the country,'' <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> said. In a victory proclamation before any results were released, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> acknowledged the opposition would have more congressional representation than in the past and said, `` The times of virtually having a single party are over, and we now enter a new political stage in the country's life, with a majority party and a very intense competition by the opposition.'' Clear-cut opposition from both the left, united for the first time, and the right swept away decades of apathy, and voters turned out in what officials say were record numbers. `` Young people turned out not just to vote but also as polling place officials to protect the cleanliness of the election,'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamente </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, said. `` The country is changing ... very broad sectors went to vote even though they knew'' there would be the traditional fraud, something that kept them away in the past, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON>, a political analyst who wrote a book on the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` They went to vote for another system.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, academic director of the <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank and graduate school, said the change was long in coming. `` From 1940 to 1988 you ca n't see many political changes,'' he said. But in the same half century, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> evolved from a sparsely inhabited rural country whose people had little education to a fast-growing urban nation with schools and well developed communications. A <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> official says the answer in the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration will be to `` play by clean rules, and on economic issues you deliver.'' <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON>, reflecting a view expressed by others, said the election `` means the end of the one-party system and also the end of a situation where the government could do what it wanted.'' But <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON> said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s assurance of a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would keep the opposition from influencing the government and still allow <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> to carry out his programs. `` I do n't think it necessarily means more pluralism,'' he said. He said that would come when there is the opposition's `` same right to govern is recognized.'' Others interviewed said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> would have to take the opposition into consideration and negotiate. Much also will depend on the credibility of the final election tally and the elections themselves. A critical factor will be whether the long-splintered left's fragile unity for the campaign continues after the election <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> has emerged as the leader the left lacked. `` It's him or nobody,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said, but he warned, `` consolidating it -LRB- the left -RRB- in a party is a formidable task.''

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday appointed an eight-member commission to seek ways to persuade followers of excommunicated Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> to remain loyal to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The pope warned on July 2 that <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> sympathizers will be excommunicated if they remain with the rebel prelate. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also promised to try to meet their traditionalist needs _ including <PERSON> Mass </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> _ if they follow the pope. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> created the first church schism in 118 years when he consecrated four traditionalist bishops on June 30 without papal permission. The act caused the automatic excommunication of the five, as well as of <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, a Brazilian prelate who assisted <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in the ceremony. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the special <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> commission will seek to preserve the `` spiritual and liturgical traditions'' of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> followers, such as the 16th century Tridentine Mass in Latin. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and his followers reject many modernizing reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council, including the replacement of the Latin Mass with a simplified liturgy in the local language. The 82-year-old French prelate's defiant act has produced the first major rupture in the church since the Old Catholics split from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1870 to protest the dogma of papal infallibility decreed by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The commission will be headed by West German Cardinal <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, who until recently was prefect of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Congregation for the Sacraments and of the Congregation for the Divine Cult Other commission members are <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tere </PERSON> <PERSON> Tena </PERSON> <PERSON> Garriga </PERSON>, undersecretary of the Congregation for the Divine Cult; Monsignor <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcic </PERSON> of the Congregation for the Clergy; Monsignor <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <PERSON> Llorente </PERSON> of the Congregation for the Religious; <PERSON> Tarcisio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertone </PERSON>, an expert in canon law; Monsignor <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Rypar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION> theologian <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Duroux </PERSON>; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocariz </PERSON> for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

<BYLINE>Changes In Robeson County: Are They Real Or Cosmetic?
^By ERICA JOHNSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five months after two American Indians took hostages at a newspaper to protest local conditions, changes have been made to address their concerns, but some say it remains to be seen whether the reforms will bring lasting change. Others say the real change is that residents of <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have realized `` that they can control their lives.'' `` It's truly cosmetic,'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said last week of the changes, which include a second superior court judgeship and a task force named by Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to investigate alleged corruption in the county. `` It's nothing more than to douse the fire, hoping it will go out,'' said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, one of two Lumbee Indian men who entered the offices of The Robesonian newspaper Feb. 1, allegedly armed, in what they said was a protest of local corruption and discrimination against minorities. The daylong siege ended when the governor agreed to appoint the task force. The county's population of about 100,000 is 37 percent Indian, 37 percent white and 26 percent black. The Rev. <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Legerton </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, also was cautious. `` The policy changes which have occurred relate to the administration of the law,'' he said. `` Hopefully, these changes will provide better treatment under the law. But they will not ensure justice throughout <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' Other residents were more optimistic. `` From my point of view, we got the second judgeship, and we're going to get a public defender,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, a Lumbee community leader who led <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s campaign for superior court judge `` That's pretty good,'' <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said. `` But we're making sure that people do n't forget and do n't let up. We're taking care of business.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a Lumbee who was running against District Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s superior court judgeship, was shot to death in March in what initially was called an assassination but was later termed a domestic dispute. That left the post to <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, who has sent more people to death row than any other prosecutor in the nation. After it became apparent that the judgeship would go to <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, the state agreed to create a second judgeship, which would go to a member of a minority group. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said the second judgeship `` was just to appease the people of <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, hoping that the people will die down.'' Because <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> is expected to be the county's senior judge, he `` will be able to set the -LRB- judicial -RRB- calendar, pick a magistrate, and set the bail-bond policy,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said. `` What have we gained? Nothing.'' But <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said real change has come in the minds of Lumbee Indians and blacks. `` The people have seen changes in themselves because they have realized that they can control their lives,'' he said. `` Now it's not just me and -LRB- fellow accused hostage-taker <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> -RRB- speaking out,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said. `` Now it's the poor farmer, it's the grass-roots people. They're realizing they can do something. They're unaccustomed to politically fighting back. But they're beginning to.'' He cited a referendum vote to unite the county's five-school system that passed by a razor-thin margin this spring. Supporters say it will lessen economic and educational disparities among schools in the system and foster a sense of common purpose. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> agreed that many people in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who previously have felt powerless now feel differently. `` People are angry, but the point is, they realize that they can do something about it,'' he said. `` I think people are going to take advantage of that, especially the younger people.'' `` It used to be we were just lost,'' said <PERSON> Georgeanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>, 66. `` Now, it seems that we are coming out.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON> also said she thought whites have treated her better in recent months. `` Maybe they feel that we're trying to pull ourselves out of where we were,'' she said. `` It's like white people are saying ` We do n't see why they waited so long.''' Would those changes have come about without the protest <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> staged? `` I think they certainly can be given credit,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a leader of Concerned Citizens and vice-chairman of the county's human-relations commission. `` We do n't approve of their means. But I think they gave us the impetus for change in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Nationalists Turning To Younger Leadership</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> began Saturday to partially dismantle its old-guard leadership, but it has yet to decide how much new blood to inject into its top ranks. The party removed 10 of the 31 members of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including five who are in their 80s. The 10 were named to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an honorary supervisory group of mostly retired officials. Nationalist leaders have stressed the importance of promoting younger members of the party, known as the Kuomingtang, which was formed 94 years ago on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> mainland and has for four decades claimed to be the sole rightful ruler of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Party spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> told reporters that the new <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will be named Thursday at the end of the weeklong 13th party congress. A Cabinet overhaul is expected later. Most of the aging leaders in the current <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ whose members' average age is 70 _ fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from the Chinese mainland in 1949, when <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> and his Nationalist government were routed by the Communists. These older Nationalists still hold a majority of seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and support the party's claim that it has the right to govern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The personnel changes are likely to determine the pace for continuing the liberalization program started by President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> before his death in January. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, the eldest son of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, lifted martial law, allowed new political parties and eased a ban on travel to mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, who Friday was elected the first native Taiwanese party chairman, has vowed to continue the democratic changes, but he has moved cautiously in the past months in order to consolidate his power. The new members of the advisory committee were proposed by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and approved by the party congress. Three media executives on the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who have said they want to give way to a younger leadership also were named to the advisory panel. But two influential 74-year-old conservatives on the policy-making committee _ Premier <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-hwa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-huan </PERSON>, secretary to the president _ were not reassigned The Independence Evening Post newspaper said Saturday that <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> and four other elder statesmen will remain a major force as `` the old generals lead the team while the young officials intern.'' `` This will be a very conservative restructuring,'' wrote political commentator <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>. He added that as the older politicians' power base diminishes, younger members of the party may be more willing to speak out. The 1,209 delegates to the party congress will elect a 180-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. For the first time, the vote will not be limited to candidates proposed by the party. Discussions among congress delegates on topics ranging from agriculture to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reportedly became heated Saturday. `` The atmosphere of this congress is different'' from previous ones, said spokesman <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>. `` There was serious debate and discussions, and delegates made candid suggestions to party leaders.''

<TEXT>
 With the first lady out of town and the president looking for a good time, invitations went out to some of the best storytellers on Capitol Hill for an evening of `` yarn swapping'' at the White House. `` He just wanted to have the boys come in, have dinner, and have a bull session,'' <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said Saturday. `` Most of it was just levity and jokes. It was just sort of a night out with the boys.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to meet with her publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, about plans to write her memoirs. Democrat <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> was one of six legislators who shared their best stories with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during a four-hour session Friday night in the president's private quarters at the White House. And what were some of those best stories? `` That's one thing there's a pledge of secrecy on,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. `` At least on the stories he might have told, anyway. ... There were a lot of good ones, but they're all super secret.'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his story about `` expectations,'' where the elderly lady, after striking up a conversation on an airplane with an elderly gentleman, pats him on the knee and tells him he reminds her of her third husband. `` The man said, ` Oh, is that right. And how many times have you been married?' And she replied, ` twice,''' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. The evening's conversation drifted into serious discussion only rarely, according to <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>. Once was when Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> what he would most like to see his successor accomplish `` He said he would like to see him push forward and adopt a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and also to get a line item veto,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. `` And then we discussed those aspects of fiscal responsibility.'' On another occasion, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the group about some of his discussions with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in May. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also talked at length about his early days in the movies, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said, and at one point he described all the `` considerations and ethics boards and everything'' that had to be cleared before <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>, could use the word `` damn'' in the closing scene of `` Gone With The Wind.'' `` He was in effect decrying the ways movies have changed,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. `` He talked about how the movies used to have a power of suggestion that the mind worked on and now there is so much activity that it leaves nothing for the mind to imagine.'' In addition to <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, others invited to the Friday evening session with the president were Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., Rep. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mo </LOCATION>., Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, the White House chief

<HEAD>Critics Denounce Namphy's Revocation Of Constitution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Critics said Saturday that Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s decision to discard the constitution approved 15 months ago demonstrates that the army has no intention of returning the country to democracy. `` The army is sick of this talk of democracy. The truth is they do n't want elections,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON>, a former senatorial candidate in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> who lives in exile in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said Friday night on state television that the existing constitution included `` elements foreign to Haitian tradition'' and was `` unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and emotion.'' He said a new constitution would be written `` taking Haitian reality into account.'' `` We are experiencing a catastrophe,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, co-author of the constitution and its most prominent defender. `` The entire army and its commander-in-chief, <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, have committed perjury. They swore allegiance to the constitution a year ago in spite of the faults that they find in it now.'' In a June 19 coup, <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, a political science professor who was elected four months earlier and is now in exile. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ruled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> between the fall of dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> in February 1986 and <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s inauguration two years later. The military officer repeatedly pledged to respect the constitution, approved by 99 percent of Haitians in a March 1987 referendum. Among the guests invited to listen to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s speech Friday at his palace in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> were former presidential candidates <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillipe-Auguste </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s agriculture Minister, and <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s adviser on constitutional law. Also present were two former Duvalier aides, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Desinor </PERSON>, and the entire army High Command, including Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, recently indicted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking. `` It was a comic and pathetic gathering Friday night at the palace,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajeux </PERSON>, a prominent opposition leader. `` A gang of dinosaurs have emerged from their caves to reassure each other that their treasure would not be threatened by several million human beings on the way to the polls to vote,'' said <PERSON> Bajeux </PERSON>. In January, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was declared the winner of army-organized elections boycotted by most Haitians. When asked to comment on <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s allegation that the constitution was inspired by foreign ideas and was contrary to Haitian tradition, <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> said, `` He is saying returning exiles bring undersirable ideas of change. I think <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> regretted the decision to open the door to exiles after <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> left.'' Meanwhile, at the end of a four-day summit of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> Community leaders in <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, Trinidad-Tobago Prime Minister A.N.R. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> criticized the organization for not condemning <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. `` I have no doubt whatsoever from the history of Gen. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> that he has no commitment to the democratic process,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Streets were quiet in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> on Saturday and business and public transportation functioned normally. `` It is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which nearly 70 percent of the population ... is vegetating,'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said in his speech. But he said his government would respect freedom of speech and assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and political parties. <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s action pushes <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> even farther away from <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule. `` The army and the Duvalierists never liked the constitution. They want an authoritarian regime. I see the path to democracy as blocked,'' he said. The army has directly or indirectly ruled this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation for most of its 184-year history.

She waited 24 hours for her worst fears to be confirmed. `` Something inside me told me he would n't be coming back,'' she said Saturday. `` I just knew.'' Rig worker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, 28, would have returned returned home Monday, the day before his wife <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> expects to give birth. Safety officer <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 49, was to begin vacation Tuesday and telephoned his wife two hours before the explosion. `` He phoned every night,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` He said he would phone me the next day and then said he loved me.'' Offshore production manager <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> arrived on Piper Alpha only hours before the explosion. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>, 19, was a trainee technician who started working offshore just a few days before. `` He ... was very enthusiastic about his new job,'' said <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>'s 16-year-old brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>. `` He was really looking forward to going offshore last Saturday.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, 48, volunteered to return to work a week early.

<HEAD>Carlucci: Stable Funding Needed For Military Projects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> called Saturday for stable congressional funding to discourage military contractors from seeking short-term profits and political advantage. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said a lack of such funding provides incentives for contractors to neglect long-term investment, to try to influence funding decisions by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and to gain information about contract awards through consultants. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the `` cumbersome and complex'' defense procurement system provides too many chances for `` congressional micro-management and influence by special advocates.'' That system has led contractors to look for short-term advantages, both financially and politically, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` And the best way for contractors to do that in our current system is to invest in ` market intelligence' _ a euphemism for hiring consultants and lobbyists to intervene in the process in the executive branch and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` Multiyear budgeting, long-term contracts, freezing weapons design, simplifying requirements, contracting to performance _ all of these techniques can be used to streamline the process and strengthen the hand of the program manager, while weakening the influence of the special advocates,'' he added. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who would not answer questions from reporters after his speech, said he was disturbed by the allegations raised by a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation that military contractors and consultants had bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials. No one has been charged in the case. `` As soon as information becomes available to us from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, we will act promptly to review contracts and take appropriate suspension, debarment and termination actions, as we have already done,'' he said.

<HEAD>State Threatens To Revoke Insurance Company's License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An insurance company faces revocation of its license in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> if it refuses to issue drought-insurance policies to about 1,000 farmers who paid for more than $ 40 million in coverage, a state official says. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said Friday that New Jersey-based <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> informed farmers who paid for the policies by a June 15 deadline that the policies will not be issued. But under a 1987 state law, once an insurance agent accepts and cashes a check from a farmer, the policy can not be canceled by either party, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. All checks were cashed by June 15, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` We've told the company that we want the policies issued,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` We're saying if you do n't issue the policies, we'll ask the attorney general's office to prepare documents to revoke'' the company's license to do business in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said a meeting is scheduled Monday between state officials and company representatives. Company officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> had told <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> insurance agents that the sales should be canceled and premiums refunded to buyers, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. The company explained that sales exceeded its capacity. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> was remiss for deciding halfway through a drought-stricken summer to refund premiums on drought coverage. When the issue first arose last week, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> contended that it had taken applications that did n't translate into coverage until it approved them. Some of the applications contain such a statement and others do n't, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. The insurance would begin paying buyers a percentage of the full amount if rainfall fell below 70 percent of normal at the nearest official rain gauge during June, July and August. The lower the rainfall, the higher the amount paid.

<HEAD>Some Police Slam `Operation Crackdown' As Media Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dozens of television and print reporters tagged along as <PERSON> Broward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheriff </PERSON>'s deputies busted 107 drug suspects and swung sledgehammers to demolish five abandoned houses frequented by crack dealers. The activities Friday were part of `` Operation Crackdown,'' the third sweep this year conducted by the sheriff's office for the media to watch. Some of the arrests were sting operations, in which deputies posed as drug dealers. `` The media draw attention to it,'' said sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` We want people to know that when they buy drugs in <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, they may be buying from a deputy. And they're going to jail.'' Also taking part in the arrests were officers from <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police agenices. But not all area police forces like the idea. `` An arrest is an arrest is an arrest whether or not it's on the 6 o'clock news,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, describing <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> as `` a media mogul.'' `` When we conduct street-level operations, to us, the media gets in the way,'' said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON>. `` I think narcotics operations are complicated enough without dragging the media along. `` We do n't operate that way. We turned away <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, the television talk show host -RRB- ... on two occasions,'' <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> in September 1986 took part in a similar sweep by the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The television personality posed as the financier in the undercover sting, and used videotape of it for his television special, `` American Vice: The Doping of a Nation,'' broadcast months later. In Friday's sweep, besides demolitions and the arrests, Operation Crackdown netted 10 guns from one home, had 40 cars towed from in front of vacant houses, and small amounts of crack and marijuana, said spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. Crack is a form of cocaine that's smoked Among those arrested was former <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who was charged with trying to buy cocaine from an undercover officer.

 You've got to have art and it should n't be confused with pornography, a <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> woman contends. So she is challenging an obscenity law in hopes of helping other artists after she was forced to put her wooden sculpture of a nude man and woman under wraps. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, 31, filed a suit last week in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here asking the court to declare unconstitutional a <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> ordinance because it infringes on her First Amendment rights to free expression. `` The reason I filed the suit was partly for myself and partly for all the artists who I'm sure do n't appreciate censorship,'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the ordinance wrongly places <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>'s sculpture `` in the same category as hard-core'' pornography <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> displayed the life-size sculptures with some of her oil paintings in May in front of her home. Police said the sculpture of the nude figures has movable joints and can assume a sexual position and thus violated the ordinance barring the public display of explicit sexual material. Although she conceded that the figures can assume a sexual position, <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said smut was not the main focus of the work and that the figures never were displayed in a sexual position.

 Israeli soldiers and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters clashed in street battles across the occupied territories Saturday. One Palestinian was fatally shot, raising the death toll to 217 as the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule entered its eighth month. A general strike shut down commerce in major cities and towns. Palestinian reports said at least 34 protesters were injured. The army put the figure at 11. Palestinian reporters said soldiers fatally shot 25-year-old <PERSON> Fayek </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in the heart after opening fire on stone-throwing protesters in <LOCATION> Jebalya </LOCATION> refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said two people were injured. The army confirmed the death in Jebalya but said it was investigating the circumstances. Officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said a woman, <PERSON> Suad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dib </PERSON> <PERSON> Ippbail </PERSON>, 34, was wounded in the hand by gunfire during the clash in <LOCATION> Jebalaya </LOCATION>. A five-year-old boy, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> <PERSON> Zidan </PERSON>, also suffered wounds in the face, left hand and left leg when he played with an explosive during or after the clash, the officials said. It was not immediately known what kind of explosive was involved. Palestinian reporters said earlier that both people injured in Jebalya were wounded by gunfire. In <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, witnesses said soldiers beat five demonstrators during a raid and fractured a man's skull by knocking his head against a wall and beating it with a rifle butt. The army said troops detained several stone-throwing youths in <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION> after chasing them into homes. It said it was investigating charges of excessive force. Stores were closed and public transportation was halted in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other main towns in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The shutdowns, expected to last at least through Sunday, follow the instructions of a leaflet signed by the `` Unified National Leadership of the Uprising-the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' In some cities, such as <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the strike began Friday under orders contained in different leaflets apparently issued by a rival underground faction. The strikes signified the start of the eighth month of the uprising, which began Dec. 8. According to official figures, 217 Arabs have been killed. Four Israelis have died. Clashes broke out in half a dozen towns and refugee camps in the occupied territories. In <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, a village of 3,000, Arabs hurled blocks and bottles at soldiers, the army said, after soldiers apparently entered the area after midnight to conduct arrests. One soldier received medical treatment after being struck in the shoulder by a block, and then the troops chased the stone-throwers into homes and detained several of them hiding under beds, an army spokesman said. During the ensuing raid, soldiers broke furniture and windows in at least 10 homes and beat five villagers with sticks and rifle butts, said <PERSON> Joost </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiltermann </PERSON>, a spokesman for Law in the Service of Man, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> affiliate of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, 23, was in intensive care at nearby <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with a fractured skull after being beaten with a rifle butt and having his head smashed into a wall, hospital officials said. The army confirmed three Palestinians were injured and hospitalized after soldiers used `` reasonable force'' to try to detain them. It said it would investigate complaints about the beatings and vandalism. In a clash at the Khan Yunis refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers who surrounded the troops, wounding 17-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Silmiya </PERSON> in the leg, the army said. Palestinian reports said 17 people were treated for tear gas and beating injuries after the incident. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> reporter said a 22-year-old man, <PERSON> Shawki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON>, was hospitalized and his right eye swollen shut after soldiers beat him in the head and kicked him after a stoning attack on troops. The army said soldiers imposed curfews on four refugee camps in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and closed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> to reporters, declaring it a closed military zone. Soldiers fought for 90 minutes with protesters in <LOCATION> Bani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naim </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, and three protesters were injured by rubber bullets, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army said six demonstrators were injured by rubber bullets in the Aida refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> after soldiers fired on several Palestinians who tried to grab a gun from a soldier and stoned the troops.

 Fire quickly engulfed an old, wood-frame rooming house early Saturday, killing three people and seriously burning another, and a rash of smaller fires was reported across the city. Fire Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said firefighters were kept busy going from fire to fire as flames broke out in 10 separate places in garbage bins, brush along fence lines and in an apartment building 20 blocks from the destroyed rooming house. Only minor damage was reported in those fires. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON>, assistant fire chief in this south-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> town of 18,000, said a state fire marshal had been called in to determine whether the fatal fire was linked to the others, which he said were probably arson. `` We are presuming those -LRB- others -RRB- are all set fires,'' he said. There have been no arrests, officials said. The state investigator was on the scene Saturday afternoon, said firefighter <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. But he and others said they did not want to be too quick to label the fatal fire as arson before they had ruled out other possible causes. `` You can always say arson, but that is a pretty easy way out,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. The dead were tentatively identified, but authorities were withholding their names pending positive identification and notification of relatives. All three victims were males, <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> said. The manager of the destroyed building, <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said he discovered the fire at 3:45 a.m. as he got up to go to work. `` When I opened the door, it seemed like all hell was busting loose,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` It knocked me back. So then I started hollering, ` Get everybody out there! It's a fire!''' One of the victims was a double amputee who called down the stairs from the second floor that he could n't find his artificial legs in the smoke, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. He said he told the frightened man to jump, but he would n't. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the rubble from the rooming house was searched and no other victims were found. There were reportedly 20 to 25 people in the two-story building when the fire hit. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said it seemed to him that the fire had begun outside the building, but fire officials said they had not determined where it began. The fires at the apartment building 20 blocks away were set in a garbage can and a laundry room, but were quickly extinguished, said fire officials. The burned man was taken to <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and later transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Harborview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> nursing supervisor <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tschauner </PERSON>. She identified him as <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 32. At <LOCATION> Harborview </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> was listed in serious condition with second and third-degree burns over 30 percent of his body. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was handing out food and blankets to those left homeless by the blaze. The first fire was reported in a garbage bin, and the second to be reported was the fatal fire, <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> said. The other eight fires were discovered later. `` While we were fighting the fire at this location -LRB- the rooming house -RRB-, we had a couple of engines as a task force going from one fire to another ... handling those -LRB- smaller -RRB- fires,'' <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Saturday criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for building and selling the same missiles <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have agreed to destroy. `` There is an irony in that just as we are eliminating nuclear-armed ballistic missiles in the range of 500 to 5,000 kilometers -LRB- 310 to 3,100 miles -RRB-, the Chinese are producing exactly those weapons,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was selling the rockets, without nuclear warheads, to countries `` around the world.'' He did not specify the countries. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke at a news conference in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, before traveling to the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> for discussions on informal talks scheduled later this month on a political settlement of the Cambodian war. He also voiced opposition to a long-standing proposal to declare <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> a nuclear-free zone, saying: `` Deterrents have kept peace in parts of the world.'' The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations has endorsed the concept of a neutral region free of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said attempts should not be made `` to restrict the quality of deterrents by a zonal approach'' but rather by balanced reductions of existing nuclear stockpiles held by the superpowers. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is expected to raise the issue of missile sales when he meets with leaders in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> during his two-week, nine-nation Asian tour. The tour, which began Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, also includes <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philipines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. In recent years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has become the fourth largest seller of weapons to the Third World. It has provided Silkworm missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and fighter planes to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s enemy <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as well as `` East Wind'' intermediate-range missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. News reports have quoted Israeli officials as saying they fear <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may sell the advanced M-9 missile, still in an experimental stage, to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arch enemy. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has denied trying to buy the missile. Also Saturday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> discussed human rights with <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lampur </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that in their three-hour meeting, <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> assured him that prisoners detained without trial in <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> jails would be accorded their full rights. Twenty-eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen, the Washington-based Asia Watch human rights group and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to raise their concerns over detentions under <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s Internal Security Act, the two human rights groups said. The act allows the government to arrest and detain people without trial indefinitely. Last fall, <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> ordered the arrest of 106 people critical of his government, including the leader of the opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Lim Kit Siang. He defended the arrests at the time by saying the detainees instigated racial clashes between the country's Malays and ethnic Chinese. `` The subject was discussed ... fundamentally in a satisfactory way,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, speaking to a news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. Opposition leaders have accused <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> of emasculating the legal system, curbing the press and endangering democracy on the pretext of quelling tensions between ethnic Chinese and Malays. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> offered no specific plan to end the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> quagmire, saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was following <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>'s lead. The organization calls for the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the introduction of an international peacekeeping force and U.S.-supervised elections. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, who briefed reporters on the flight to <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> received assurances from both <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> they would continue to grant temporary asylum to Vietnamese boat people refugees. Both countries, facing a new influx of Vietnamese, had threatened to take tough action. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also gained informal support, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to set up a Bangkok-based working group to explore fresh solutions to the 30-year-old refugee exodus from communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` We will continue our strong support for humanitarian treatment of refugees and we will continue our strong intake,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at the news conference in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> held talks with the foreign ministers of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> member countries. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plays golf Sunday with top <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> officials and on Monday holds talks with President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said U.S.-backed rebels twice attacked troops Saturday in violation of a government-declared cease-fire, killing two soldiers in one attack and losing four dead in another. The ministry said in a statement that the rebels, known as Contras, killed two soldiers, wounded one and captured four others in a morning ambush about 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> in the province of <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>. In another incident in a remote region near the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, four rebels were killed when they attacked Sandinista troops, the statement said. The government has declared a unilateral cease-fire until July 31 to allow time to restart stalled peace talks. A fragile truce has been in effect since March 21, but no new sessions of talks have been scheduled to end the nearly 7-year-old war between the Contras and the leftist Sandinista regime. The Contras agreed to go along with the latest cease-fire as long as they were n't attacked. Saturday's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement was the latest in a series of government charges that the rebels are ignoring the truce. It said Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has asked a monitoring commission set up after the first round of talks to verify a rebel attack July 4 in the Chontales province. The government says 12 soldiers and civilians were killed in that attack. The Sandinistas came to power in July 1979 after 42 years of rule by the rightist, pro-U.S. government of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>.

 A woman was critically injured when a tiger attacked her after she fell during a filming session for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at a wild game farm, authorities said. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Frobig </PERSON>, 40, was listed in critical condition Saturday at <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> following surgery for severe wounds to the head, neck and shoulder. The owner of Animal Advocates wild game farm, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Frobig </PERSON> had been working as a volunteer about a month. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> needed footage of a tiger running through tall grass. The tiger, named <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, was to be unleashed by an assistant and run to Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who was holding food, for the filming. Volunteers held portable fencing to help corral the animal. After a successful dry run, the tiger began his lope, then veered toward the fence that Ms. <PERSON> Frobig </PERSON> was holding, Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Frobig </PERSON> moved to readjust the fence but fell in the bumpy grass. `` When she fell down, the tiger was thinking, ` Oh, this is a fun toy.' When he did bite, he became possessive and did n't want anyone to take her away. He carried her about 10 feet,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. She said one assistant hit the tiger with a heavy stick and another dove onto the animal, trying to get him to let go. After the tiger backed off, Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> calmed it down and took it back to its cage. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, a 3-year-old, 500-pound <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger, remained in quarantine at Animal Advocates. Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said she had owned him since he was 3 weeks old, and he never attacked anyone before. Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 30, a former zookeeper in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said she had operated the farm as a non-profit organization for five years, mostly to raise and train animals and take them to schools to teach children about wildlife. She said she would now close the farm. It was animals from Animal Advocates that starred in the movie `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hendersons </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Saturday denied reports he and his delegates might stage a walkout at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> but promised the convention would feature lively debate. `` It will not be sterile,'' he said. `` We can deliberate and debate without being divisive.'' Although Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is assured the party's presidential nomination, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave no sign Saturday of backing down `` Some people have made unreasonable requests, like if we would just surrender, we would have a prime-time speaking place,'' he said. `` My name will be in nomination,'' he said. `` We will have -LRB- platform -RRB- planks on the floor, those that are not resolved between now and that time, and that should be a reasonable expectation.'' But he added that he does not plan to lead a walkout of his delegates. `` It would not be to our advantage to walk out,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The threat is not that we're going to walk out. The threat is that we're going to stay and expand and build and grow and make a difference.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to reporters as he attended a small private fund-raiser for his Keep <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> home of director-producer <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camps already have resolved disputes over party rules and delegate credentials, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he expects negotiators for both campaigns to continue meeting to settle differences on other subjects. He called for an expanded schedule at the convention to allow minority issues to be addressed. `` We're making history not hysteria,'' he said. `` We're doing what's standard and what's normal and what we've earned the right to do.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reserved comment on potential vice presidential candidates, and said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have yet to personally discuss in depth the possibility of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> being the running mate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he expects to have such a private talk before the start of the convention on July 18. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> this week that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s followers would be `` outraged,'' as would <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> himself, if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked former presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as his running mate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the comment had been <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>'s personal opinion. `` No one is authorized in my campaign to give a value judgment or a political evaluation of anyone else under consideration,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> confirmed he had sent a private message to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stating that he personally has not made any private or public judgment regarding any potential running mate's qualifications for the vice presidential slot.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its forces recaptured a series of mountain peaks in its northern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains Saturday after a four-day battle with Iranian forces. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said numerous areas along the northern front were taken back, including 14 mountain peaks. It also said Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery shot down an Iranian F-4 jet fighter as it attempted to cross into <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory. A report carried by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> denied losing any planes Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, confirmed there was fighting in the northern mountains. In the last three months, the Iraqis have achieved important victories including the recapture of an oil terminal at <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> in April, the <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION> region in May and the southern oil-rich Majnoon marshes in June. After its victories in the south, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been concentrating on driving Iranian forces out of its the northern mountains.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Saturday a plan by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to boost fees for some government services amounts to raising taxes, something the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president has said he would not do. `` I understand yesterday he had some difficulty distinguishing between certain kinds of taxes and other taxes,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Back where I come from, if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, as he attended a private fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, denied reports he and his delegates might stage a walkout at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The threat is not that we're going to walk out,'' he told reporters. `` The threat is that we're going to stay and expand and build and grow and make a difference.'' He gave no sign of surrendering to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp, saying, `` my name will be in nomination. We will have -LRB- platform -RRB- planks on the floor, those that are not resolved between now and that time, and that should be a reasonable expectation.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was referring to comments by the vice president that he favors higher fees including higher payments for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> recipients who choose to accept catastrophic health care coverage under terms of recent health legislation. `` I do n't know if Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has problems trying to distinguish between taxes and premiums, but I think we'd better read the fine print in that insurance policy very, very carefully before we sign on,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in opening remarks at a news conference. Republicans, meanwhile, holding a rally in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on his search for a running mate, his fiscal policies and his size. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, national campaign manager for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' search for a vice presidential candidate to join him on the ticket was `` making <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> look like the rock of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's decision to raise taxes in his home state while running for president was `` dumb.'' `` If you're undertaxed, vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. If you're overtaxed ... we want you in our party,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a former candidate himself for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> made cracks about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' height. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` a mere midget compared to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the differences in experience between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> amounted to `` the tale of the tall and the short.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is 5 feet 8 inches tall. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to a group of about 250 students at the <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a public school for immigrants in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reminded them of his own immigrant heritage and said to them, `` You are the future of this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who will pick up the Democratic presidential nomination next week in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, again found himself faced with repeated questioning on his continuing deliberations about the vice presidential candidate. He said he had not made a decision, did not know when he would announce one and would meet with senior aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> after returning to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Sunday to discuss the choice. At a later appearance in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship being refitted at the port shipyard and spoke to a small crowd. He cited the investigation into alleged fraud on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons contracts and blasted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, saying it `` not only does n't believe in public service, it's contemptuous of public service.'' `` I do n't know what the true nature is of this breaking scandal over the Pentagon. I do n't take any particular pleasure in it _ I think it's a very sad day,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But I'll tell you this _ I'm going to do everything I can as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop that revolving door'' between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and defense contractors that often hire former military officials. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was flying on to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, for a tour of the port on a tugboat. He was ending the day in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Estes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was accompanied throughout his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> stop by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, who sat with him at a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> baseball game Friday night <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said he believed Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> remained the most likely vice presidential choice and that <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> would pose a problem if selected because he did not run as well in the presidential race as did <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I kind of doubt that it will be somebody who ran,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` Unless they pick No. 2, and that's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, it's a little awkward to go to somebody who ran third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh.'' Shortly after arriving in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he was consulting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the selection of a running mate. `` Am I consulting him? No,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We're talking, and he's one of a number of people I'm considering As he himself has said, it's up to the nominee, and I'll make that decision.''

 Eight members of a convoy carrying aid to Nicaraguan civilians were arrested Saturday during a melee after they tried to cross a bridge into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The scuffle broke out on the international bridge when officers sprayed a cayenne-based irritant into the truck of the Veterans Peace Convoy, which had blocked a traffic lane for four hours. Police arrested the eight as 50 of their supporters chanted, `` The whole world is watching!'' and rushed past a line of police at the bridge toll booth that separates the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Customs officers said allowing the trucks to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without assurances they would be returned would violate a trade embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The convoy, which had tried to cross the same bridge a month ago, had intended to take 17 vehicles into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> at noon Saturday. Two trucks were driven to the toll booth where Customs officers and police stopped them. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, acting chief Customs inspector, told <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livesey </PERSON>, driver of the convoy's lead pickup, that he could not allow him to turn onto the Mexico-bound lane. `` This is as far as you're going to get,'' <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> told <PERSON> Livesey </PERSON>. `` You can turn north -LRB- back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- here if you want.'' <PERSON> Livesey </PERSON> responded: `` We're not moving. ... We're either going to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> here _ this is a free border _ or we're going to jail. He then placed several boxes of baby food on the hood of his car and refused to budge. Four hours later, police again told the trucks' occupants they must move the vehicles or be arrested. The trucks stayed put, and officers stuck a nightstick into a window of a truck driven by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meserve </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The window shattered as <PERSON> Meserve </PERSON> tried to roll it up. Officers simultaneously sprayed the cab with the substance laced with cayenne, a very hot, irritating spice. About 50 supporters of the convoy had been watching and rushed past officers as the arrests began. Some started pounding on a convoy truck, shouting, `` The whole world is watching!'' <PERSON> Livesey </PERSON>, 46, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Meserve </PERSON> were among those arrested. `` There was a little bit of pushing and shoving but there was nothing where anybody was in any real, serious danger,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Once the arrests were made, the crowd began following officers' orders and moved back, he said. Police towed the convoy's pickup trucks off the bridge, and traffic across it was restored to normal soon afterward.

 `` Caengratulations'' reads an editorial headline saluting 50 years and about 4.9 miles of columns about the city's sights and characters by writer <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Caen </PERSON>. `` For 50 years now, <ORGANIZATION> Herb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caen </ORGANIZATION> has painted word portraits of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' said state Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in a short piece in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chronicle </LOCATION>'s Sunday Punch section. `` Caen's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> may not always be the city we remember, but it is the city we want to remember,'' he said. In its editorial in Sunday's editions, the Chronicle commended <LOCATION> Caen </LOCATION> for his `` verve, panache, brilliance, incisiveness, humor, sympathy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Caen </ORGANIZATION> recalled starting the column at the age of 22, as a lucky young greenhorn from the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> farming city of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. He referred to himself as the `` kid in the candy store, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> in Oz, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wonderland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> and his Electric Column.'' And he expressed his continuing fascination with <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` A marvelous city to write about,'' he said. `` Like a snake it sheds its skins, changes its shape, wanders off in unexpected directions. A hard city for sentimentalists, which most writers are.''

 Troubleshooter `` Red'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> took the first steps Saturday toward capping the wells of a burned-out oil platform. The rig's owner said it might take three weeks to find the bodies of 149 men killed in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> disaster. <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>'s men explored the twisted remains of the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform for about an hour Saturday and used a camera-equipped submersible vessel to assess the damage, said a statement from the platform's owner, Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> to make the rig safe, seal gas leaks and save the oil wells to which the rig is connected The 73-year-old <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has gained fame over several decades by capping out-of-control oil wells. `` It seems to me there are three or four wells that are burning ... and two are burning pretty good,'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said after examining the remains of the platform. He said everything was going well `` and we expect to stay on schedule,'' but did not elaborate. `` I'd like to say one thing. ... I've never seen so many safety-conscious people in my life and I think they are doing an excellent job,'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> exploded Wednesday night in a fireball that <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> says may have been caused by a gas leak directly below the living quarters. Sixty-four men escaped. Eighteen remained in the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infirmary </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, one in serious condition. Seventeen bodies were recovered before the search was called off Friday night around the ruined platform 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brading </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Saturday the company wants to recover the bodies but must clear debris from the site of the world's worst oil field disaster and make the area safe for divers. `` I think it's going to be some days before we remove the debris, and then the capping will begin,'' <PERSON> Brading </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, where most of the bereaved families live or have gathered. `` Once the situation is safe, we will send divers down whose first task will be to search for remains.'' <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said fires still burned at several of the platform's 36 wellheads It said all leaking oil was burning and none was escaping to the sea. <PERSON> Brading </PERSON> predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> disaster would bring `` a whole number of changes'' in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rigs, echoing the views expressed Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The government has ordered public and technical inquiries. `` What might have been an acceptable standard for this day last week appears to be an unacceptable standard today,'' <PERSON> Brading </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and Gas, said living quarters may be separate from the production platform in future. `` Living on something which produces oil and gas is, in my opinion, too dangerous,'' he told the news conference. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said workers would have had to be a quarter-mile from the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> to have been safe. `` There is going to be the question of, ` should not people living there be on something that can back away _ in effect, be a floating hotel?''' he said. Survivor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON>, 35, has said at least 100 men died screaming for help, trapped in the rig's living quarters after suriving the initial explosion. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> reported part of the rig's accommodation quarters was retrieved from the site Saturday and a spokesman said: `` It was described as in good condition. As far as I know no bodies were found on board.'' Company officials played down a report in The Scotsman newspaper quoting retired safety manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> as saying the company ignored safety recommendations, after a 1984 explosion on the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION>, that included replacing the wooden living-quarters module. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said the platform complied with all government standards. A memorial service for the dead will be held Wednesday in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>.

 Arab governments in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> find the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval presence oppressive at times but do not plan to start opposing it because an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship shot down an Iranian airliner, officials said Saturday. There also are no signs of a major shift in public opinion in the week since missiles fired by the cruiser <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet over the gulf, killing all 290 people aboard. The incident was `` a very big disaster,'' said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. `` At the same time, I blame <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> because of the existence of the state of war and because of its refusal to accept peace efforts.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, speaking to reporters <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> after meeting with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, apparently was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s Resolution 598 calling for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war that has often spilled into the gulf He called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept the resolution `` in order to avoid more disasters.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> divers pulled five more bodies, all men, from the gulf. The bodies were taken to the southern Iranian city of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> for identification. The airliner took off from the city's airport before it was downed. One body was identified as that of <PERSON> Jamshar </PERSON> <PERSON> Morad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, a citizen of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, according to an Iranian TV report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Previous Iranian reports said less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only 150 identified. Thirty-eight of the passengers were foreigners. Some statements by governments and editorial writers criticize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action for causing loss of life but generally express the view that the culprit is the Iran-Iraq war rather than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbors have been at war since September 1980. Public attitudes appear to reflect that sentiment, said editor <PERSON> Mahbub </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahedi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khaleej </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a major newspaper in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, just across the southern gulf from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Sympathy for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s point of view is perhaps stronger in the Emirates than in any other Arab gulf state. About 150,000 Iranian citizens and many other ethnic Iranians live in the federation, which has close commercial ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` The widespread feeling is that the tragedy should not have taken place,'' <PERSON> Zahedi </PERSON> said. `` It would not have taken place if the war had stopped. As long as the war continues, such things will happen.'' Seventeen residents of the Emirates were on the passenger list of last Sunday's Flight 655 from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> across the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zahedi </PERSON>'s newspaper printed a full page, black-bordered `` thanks for condolences'' ad Saturday signed by a ranking police official of the Emirates, whose father was among the dead. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a young Kuwaiti staying at a hotel in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, said the tragedy `` made people in the Emirates very angry.'' When asked whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet should be withdrawn from the gulf, he replied: `` No. But maybe there is a problem between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Most editorials have stressed the need to end the war, but some newspapers took the opportunity to condemn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy built around support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the universal Arab enemy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` downed the whole region decades ago,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaleej </PERSON>, published in the <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION> emirate. Many Arab officials say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commitment has helped bring stability but they find the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s presence sometimes difficult to bear. On Monday, the day after the Iranian plane was shot down, an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomat said privately that a broadening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role `` can only mean more explosive situations.'' A Western diplomat whose territory includes most of the gulf, from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in the north to <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, said most officials with whom he deals feel the war is to blame for the disaster. `` They are stunned by the tragedy, but they're not blaming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although they are trying now to distance themselves from the Americans as much as possible. They are not prepared to kick Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. That viewpoint came through in statements by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments, which avoided direct criticism of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Continuation of the destructive Iraq-Iran war threatens the entire region with more tragedies day after day,'' said an official source in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, an island state that provides limited port facilities to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said `` more painful incidents could take place'' unless the war ends, and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> issued a similar statement. King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which broke relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> this year after accusing it of terrorism and subversion, was said to have called for `` vigilance to confront any sudden development.'' His apparent reference was to threats of revenge some Iranian officials made after the plane was shot down. Concern about Iranian retaliation is especially strong in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which has been hit by <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> missiles and terrorist bombings blamed on pro-Iran extremists. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses the sheikdom of helping <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s request, has reflagged 11 Kuwaiti tankers so the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> can protect them. `` They are expecting something dramatic,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat based in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` They think they are the ones to take the heat. They think American actions have got them in trouble.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee is investigating allegations of attempts to influence senior <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and six other cities, a panel aide says. `` The allegations of misconduct concern high-level people at district and regional office levels,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barash </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the Lawrenceville-based <ORGANIZATION> Gwinnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. For seven weeks, subcommittee investigators and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> have been looking into charges of abuse by senior staffers in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barash </PERSON> said. The investigators also are trying to determine if top officials at <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> failed to act against senior regional officials who allegedly misused their authority, <PERSON> Barash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barash </PERSON> said the subcommittee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, D-Ga., received a number of allegations in the spring about misconduct within the agency `` We checked out some things and found out that the allegations appear at this preliminary stage of the investigation to be true enough to begin a formal investigation,'' he said. `` It looks like some people, some top <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> senior staffers, were involved in misconduct, abusing of their power for private, personal gain or enrichment.'' <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>'s subcommittee will conduct hearings by early October on the results of its investigation, <PERSON> Barash </PERSON> said. The staff director described one case in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> involving a senior criminal investigator who went to work for <ORGANIZATION> Guess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after leaving the federal agency. `` The allegation with regards to <ORGANIZATION> Guess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeans </ORGANIZATION> is it had an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> senior employee in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> under its control and influence and got this employee to either initiate criminal tax fraud investigations -LRB- against a competing jeans company -RRB- or to kill criminal tax fraud investigations at the behest of Guess Jeans,'' said <PERSON> Barash </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Gwinnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman for the jeans maker as saying the company did nothing wrong and has agreed to cooperate with federal investigators.

<HEAD>Strike Averted at Dublin Pubs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bartenders on Saturday approved a settlement with pub owners over a pay dispute that developed after the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed new laws to extend pub hours. The laws, approved last month in an effort to accommodate the tourist industry, came into operation smoothly in the rest of the country but in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> the bartenders demanded extra pay and threatened to strike Saturday morning. The 3,000 union bartenders in the city earn an average $ 300 a week and wanted $ 45 a week more and an extra half day off every two weeks if they were going to work the new hours, which would increase their 40-hour work week by an hour. Publicans offered a one-time `` goodwill payment'' of $ 150 to bartenders with more than six months' service, and an extra $ 18 a week. Union leaders recommended acceptance of the offer and barmen approved it by a vote of 628 to 539. There are about 750 pubs in the city area _ about 500 of them employing union members. The rest of the pubs are run by families and have been operating the new hours. The pubs used to close at 11:30 p.m. in summer and 11 p.m. in winter, Monday through Saturday. Now they can close at midnight in summer and 11:30 in winter. They get an extra hour Sunday, closing at 11 instead of 10 p.m. The one-hour afternoon closure between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m., in effect in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> only, also has been eliminated. The main aim of the new laws was to answer complaints from the tourist industry that visitors thought closing time was too early.

 Residents of this southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farming town offer nervous jokes about the 13 dynamite bombs that were found beneath bridges, behind businesses and two historic buildings. The bombs, traced to a theft of dynamite last month in another <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> town, were defective and failed to detonate, but the thought of what might have happened has made an impact on the town of 6,000. Patrons at <PERSON> Donanna </PERSON>'s Restaurant kidded each other Friday about the 300 sticks of dynamite found with clocks and makeshift blasting caps. `` They'll look under a chair and say ` Is there a bomb under here?' and laugh,'' said <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON>, a manager at the restaurant. But, says <PERSON> Noland </PERSON>, `` it is n't anything to joke about, really.'' Rewards totaling $ 10,000 have been offered for information about the explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> posted the original $ 5,000 reward Thursday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> matched that Friday. `` Now anyone who calls stands to gain $ 10,000, so maybe it will help,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said about 35 investigators from his agency, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and state police were in the town about 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said the dynamite used in the bombs had been traced to a theft at Mulzer Crushed Stone in English He said the dynamite, which was stolen between June 6 and 13, also has been linked to a bomb similar to those planted in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> that exploded along <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> 37 about a mile south of English on July 1. The town of English is about 30 miles southwest of here. `` A passing motorist reported some smoke and fire at a roadside rest area,'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said. `` It was the same type of device and the dynamite was from the same theft.'' There have been no arrests in the theft. Three of the dynamite bundles found Tuesday morning detonated partially, producing smoke and small fires. Authorities closed off the central business district and disarmed the 10 remaining bombs, which had been concealed in brown grocery bags and covered with debris. Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said the explosives were the work of terrorists, but others disagree. `` I think whoever did it just wanted publicity,'' said <PERSON> Noland </PERSON>. `` If they were serious, they could have rigged at least one of them to go off, anyway, out of 13.'' The bombs failed to explode because black powder charges intended to trigger the dynamite was improperly packed, investigators said. Dynamite is no harder to obtain than a handgun in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> since it is used in road construction, in quarries and in mining. It requires careful handling, but the techniques are widely known in the construction and mining trades. `` I'm no expert, but you do n't need to be a specialist for something like that,'' said <PERSON> Noland </PERSON>, who also owns a 130-acre farm outside nearby <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, a retired contractor who used explosives in road construction, noted reports from investigators that the amount of dynamite involved could have leveled a sizable portion of the downtown. `` They were just lucky that whoever did it did n't know anything about -LRB- black -RRB- powder,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. Police have refused to discuss a possible motive, and residents could point to no community-wide disputes in the town. `` I think they're interested in any theory,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former deputy county prosecutor who now has a private law practice. A bomb containing 52 sticks of dynamite was found beneath the wooden back steps to his office, and <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> had a long meeting with investigators late in the week. <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> doubted he was the target of the explosives. And the fact that most of the bombs were placed near government property might not mean much either, he said. `` Often with a crime like this, when you look for some philosophical explanation, what you find instead is some personal, selfish explanation,'' he said. `` It's just as likely that this was done to destroy documents or collect insurance.'' Police and federal agents set up a command post at <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and questioned residents door-to-door throughout the week. Some found the police presence reassuring but wondered what would happen if authorities left without making an arrest. `` I find myself, when I drive down the street, looking in the faces of the people I pass,'' said <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON>. `` I'm asking myself ` Is this the kind of person who would do something like that?'''

 Rain fell Saturday on parts of the parched <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, including an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> town where Hopi Indians performed a rain dance the night before, but elsewhere in the drought region the sky was clear and dry and temperatures rose as high as 102 degrees. Clouds kept temperatures below the 90s across much of the Plains and the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, but readings hit 100 in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, hit a record high of 102. It was the first time since July 1954 that there were three consecutive days of 100 or higher readings in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, the weather service said. Other records were posted in cities from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Government observers, meanwhile, spent most of Saturday surveying drought-stricken river basins in central and southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The field work was the immediate result of the executive order signed Friday by Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, declaring a statewide water emergency. `` The effort this weekend has been to establish valid priorities for emergency response efforts,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental response team, said Saturday. `` We want to apply our available resources to the areas of greatest need.'' In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a hot-weather emergency was declared and two community centers were opened for anyone over 60 who needed an air-conditioned escape. And while the weather in most of the nation was arid, snowplows worked nearly four hours clearing a foot of hail from Interstate 25 on the north edge of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> on Saturday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> issued an ozone warning because the hot air over the state's metropolitan areas has trapped pollution. `` What's happening is we have a lot of hot, stagnant air sitting here and it's been sitting here for a while,'' <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> OEPA </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> declared a heat emergency in his city, extending the hours of operation at five of the city's air-conditioned `` cooling centers. Strong thundershowers and gusting winds swept through southern and central <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> on Saturday, as well as northwestern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` This is going to help, although I do n't think you can call it a drought-buster,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, forecaster for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` You'd need several more days like this in a row.'' Several <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> cities reported more than an inch of rain, including 1 inch at <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION>, where 16 Hopi Indians performed rain rituals Friday night. `` The miracles are still here, we just have to ask for them,'' said retired farmer <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who helped organize the appearance. Scattered showers and thunderstorms swept through northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> urged residents of every faith to `` take a moment to pray for the end of the drought at their place of worship'' on Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> has 30 water trucks operating around the clock to save the city's trees. At least half of the 30,000 young trees planted in the past three years at a cost of $ 8 million will die if they do not get water, City Forester <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Skiera </PERSON> said. Thunderstorms that moved over <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> late in the week provided the first heavy rain there in several months, the weather service said. As much as 5 inches fell at <PERSON> Finlayson </PERSON> in central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the weather service said. In spite of that, `` We are on the verge of a major disaster in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and it's from north to south and east to west,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>, state director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, told a legislative hearing Friday. If the drought does n't end `` we are headed for suspension of all surface water irrigation in the state,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nargang </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>' water division, told the lawmakers. Much of the Corn Belt is entering the critical pollination stage when kernels are formed on the corn ears, agriculture experts said. But heat speeds up the shedding of pollen from corn tassles and delays the emergence of corn silks, which accept the pollen grains to form the seed, agronomists say. Agronomists at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> wo n't speculate on potential losses, but say at least 25 percent of that state's $ 1.2 billion corn crop already has been lost. `` It's potentially one of the worst things we've ever seen in corn,'' said agronomist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>'s top corn expert. Experts in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> have estimated that half of that state's corn crop will be lost; Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> declared the entire state a disaster area Friday. Corn yields in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> are expected to be cut by about 40 percent, and even with adequate rain through the rest of the summer, yields could be as low as 56 bushels an acre statewide, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, the state averaged 96 bushels of corn per acre. `` We'd have to have better than average rainfall to get that 60 percent -LRB- yield potential -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't get three or four inches of rain in the near future, we wo n't get that.''

<TEXT>
 Members of the Pakistani <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday demanded immediate elections and criticized President Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> for dissolving the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and for dismissing the civilian Cabinet. `` President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> should not play with the constitution,'' Sen. <PERSON> Khurshid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said on the opening day of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the upper house of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which was not dissolved. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met for the first time Saturday after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> _ the powerful lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ on May 29. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> also had dismissed his civilian Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> and his 33-member Cabinet the same day, accusing them of corruption, incompetence, and failure to speedily introduce Islam or prevent breakdown of law and order. The senators protesting <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s actions challenged these steps and charged <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> with `` insulting the entire <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' and bringing `` parliamentary and democratic institutions into disrepute,'' by making false allegations of corruption against the assembly members. `` In Islam, punishment for false accusations is to be flogged 80 times,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said while criticizing <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> actions. <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> also has called <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> actions as `` arbitrary'' and accused the president of `` disrupting the democratic process which was smoothly under way,'' after eight years of martial law during which the president ruled the country up to 1985. All the senators demanded holding of elections within 90 days of the dissolution of the assembly as the constitution provides, which means by Aug. 27. Although <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> originally indicated he may hold the polls by 90 days, he has remained silent on the subject and refused to set an election date so far, in spite of demands by all political parties.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s first presidential primary in four decades Saturday gave <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION> provincial Gov. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> an upset victory over <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> provincial Gov. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>, officials said. Electoral board returns to choose the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the 1989 presidential election showed the charismatic <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> leading 735,799 votes -LRB- 53 percent -RRB- to <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>'s 641,163 votes -LRB- 46.2 percent -RRB-. The remaining percentage went to lesser candidates or nullified ballots. The labor-backed <ORGANIZATION> Justicialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, more commonly known as the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s main opposition group. It made a comeback in national elections in September last year after five years of electoral setbacks, capturing the governorships of 17 of the 22 provinces. The party has been split in recent months over the candidacies of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, a fiery orator, and party president <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>, a member of a reform faction. Observers had given <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>, the former economy minister, a slight edge going into the voting. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 53, appeared smiling on television late Saturday. `` Of course I'm happy. We won. We ran a good race,'' he said. In remarks from a downtown hall in the capital <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> dedicated his victory to `` the poorest people, those who need it the most.'' <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>, 66, whom <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> described as `` my friend ... a loyal man -LRB- who ran -RRB- a dignified campaign,'' went on television later Saturday for about three minutes to congratulate `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the winner.'' Complete official results were expected Monday. <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON> said he would support <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> in the presidential elections, dispelling fears in political circles of a split in the main opposition party, which is favored to defeat the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> next year. Both candidates had favored declaring a moratorium on the interest portion of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s huge $ 53 billion foreign debt. The upcoming campaign is expected to focus on economic issues in inflation-plagued <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. In a related development, a flatbed truck carrying some voters to the polls collided Saturday afternoon with a train at an unmarked rail crossing in northern <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, killing at least 16 people and seriously injuring about 20 others, police and hospital officials said. The accident occurred as the truck was taking voters to a polling station in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebrachal </LOCATION>, a village 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Salta </LOCATION>. Up to 4.1 million card-carrying party members were eligible to vote in the nationwide internal elections. No other incidents were reported as voter turnouts of up to 65 percent in some interior provinces were reported. The party, founded in the late 1940s behind the populist, pro-union tendencies of former President Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, mainly attracts working-class adherents, some of whom beat bass drums fervently at mass rallies. Its politics range from center-left to rightist, often defying traditional party definitions. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> elected its candidate, centrist <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> provincial Gov. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, on July 3. By law, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> can not run for re-election. The presidential elections are tentatively scheduled for next May or June, and the president will be elected to a six-year term beginning in December. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s election in 1983 ended a harsh nearly eight-year military dictatorship during which at least 9,000 suspected leftists were abducted and vanished without a trace during the `` dirty war'' waged by the military against subversion.

 Some 360,000 gallons of radioactive water were released into a stream at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, environmental officials were told Saturday. Plant spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>, who attributed the release to a procedural error, said the spill Friday should not affect the health of the workers or the public around the plant, located in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> environmental authorities were notified Saturday morning, although the amounts of the release did not require notification, The <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in their combined Sunday editions. The water contained two to three millicuries of Cesium-137, a waste byproduct known to cause cancer. <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said standards allow a maximum annual release of 175 millicuries. By the end of May, 50 millicuries had been released at the plant. `` It's a very high release for a 12-hour period,'' <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said. `` But it's well within our guidelines.'' The contaminated water was expected to reach the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 6:30 p.m. Sunday. <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said most of Cesium-137 would settle to the bottom of Four Mile Creek.

 Firefighters cut the final three miles of fire line through a steep, rocky area on the southwest edge of a fire that stalled Saturday after burning 16,500 acres in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, a fire that scorched hundreds of acres in a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state forest forced the evacuation of about 200 people, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> firefighters battled several fires in drought-parched areas of the state, and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> crews contained a stubborn blaze and hoped to have it controlled by Sunday. Elsewhere: _ Firefighters brought the blaze in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Shoshone National Forest under control Saturday afternoon, helped in part by rainy weather earlier in the week. _ Fires that have scorched more than 2,000 acres of <LOCATION> Harriman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were contained, a park ranger said. _ A single-engine plane crash-landed on a highway in the foothills behind <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Saturday, triggering a small brush fire and forcing closure of a five-mile stretch of the roadway. Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said the pilot suffered minor injuries in the incident just above Devil's Canyon. _ And firefighters contended with forest fires across eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> as temperatures soared into triple digits, and a Division of Forestry spokesman called on the governor to consider declaring a fire emergency in the state. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, more problems arose when four new fires started. Some of the 1,200 firefighters at the main fire scene were pulled away to douse the latest blazes that apparently were started by lightning Friday night, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Libbey </PERSON>, fire information officer. One of the new fires came within a half-mile of the <ORGANIZATION> Blacks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playhouse </ORGANIZATION>, a summer theater that was narrowly missed by the main fire earlier in the week. Only one of the new fires, at <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Edgemont </LOCATION>, had been contained by Saturday afternoon, <PERSON> Libbey </PERSON> said. Roads skirting the northwest and northeast corners of 73,000-acre Custer State Park were reopened Saturday, but the park itself remained closed to the public. Thirty families evacuated from an area just outside the western park boundary were allowed to return home at their own risk, a fire spokesman said. They had been ordered to leave Friday after flames jumped Highway 87 on the southwest edge of the fire in the area around <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coolidge </LOCATION>. The main fire has been burning since Monday night. Fire officials suspect lightning that ignited the extremely dry forest in the north-central part of <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The blaze, named the <ORGANIZATION> Galena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION>, is by far the largest fire ever in the park, but not the biggest in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, officials said. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, residents who live near <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> had to leave their homes when a fire roared through Au <ORGANIZATION> Sable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. The fire spread rapidly, burning at least 400 acres with 3 -LCB- hours, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. About 100 firefighters were battling the blaze, he said. `` We've got a good organization in place and a lot of good equipment so we're in a good position to hold the fire,'' <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> said. Authorities said the cause of the fire was still under investigation. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, three fires near <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> burned a home, an acre of grass and 26 acres of woods and grass. A sheriff's deputy suffered minor burns and a firefighter suffered heat exhaustion fighting the most extensive blaze, about five miles northeast of <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevaskis </PERSON> said the fire was started by a farmer who was burning trash in violation of the statewide burning ban. The lightning-caused Echo Canyon fire that charred 475 acres of sagebrush and some aspen trees in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> was contained Friday night, said <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Ensley </PERSON>. Containment of the Echo Canyon blaze followed recent battles against a number of fires in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, including a 900-acre fire in Zion National Park and a 3,500-acre fire near the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> border.

 Rescue workers removed the last four victims from the wreckage of a collapsed department store Saturday and said the death toll was 14, not 16 as feared earlier. Officials said the disaster might have been caused by a clogged storm drain on the building's roof. `` There is no need to check again. We have checked, double-checked, triple-checked and quadruple-checked. There are no more bodies in there,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Plitt </PERSON>, head of a heavy equipment company that supplied some of the machinery used in the rescue effort. Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> concurred, saying officials were convinced that the last victim had been found. Two adults and four children were rescued from the massive pile of rubble Friday, but at least 47 were injured in addition to the 14 who died. In all, four bodies were recovered Saturday. Confusion about the death toll continued until the final victim, <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON>, was removed from the debris late Saturday afternoon. Officials had said they believed that the body of Mrs. <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON>'s 4-year-old son, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was with her under the rubble But they later determined that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s body was one of those that had been found earlier in the day. They had also thought they saw another victim near Mrs. <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON>'s body, but when her body was recovered this proved not to be the case, they said. Clogged drainage holes on the building's flat roof could have contributed to the collapse by allowing rain water to accumulate and possibly overload the building, said <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromack </PERSON>, tax assessor-collector for <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` If you were the owner of the store, how many times would you go up and see if the drainage pipes were clogged, especially if it's a three-story building?'' Cromack asked. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Yzaguirre </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a city tax assessor-collector, said the building was inspected earlier this year by the fire department, as it is annually. Minimal construction standards contributed to the tragedy, other officials charged. `` That old store was nothing more than a stack of blocks,'' <PERSON> Cromack </PERSON> said. `` This was bound to happen sooner or later.'' The third floor of the 20-year-old building was added in 1975 and <PERSON> Cromack </PERSON> said the building's construction was average for one that age in the area, explaining `` we do n't build as heavy as they do elsewhere because we do n't have snow.'' `` The roof is not designed to carry all that weight,'' <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> building inspector <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> told The Dallas Morning News. `` It's a tragedy and one that may happen again at any time.'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, could not immediately be reached for comment. A woman who answered the phone at his home said she was a friend and she did n't know where he was or when he would return. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said investigations were being launched by the city, the building's insurance company and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said the rainstorm, which poured 2 inches in less than 30 minutes, may have been a factor, but that other factors also may have played a role. `` We have a report from witnesses that a bolt of lightning struck behind the building and hit some transformers and perhaps knocked them down,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. Rescue workers had concentrated their efforts Saturday on two sites in the rear of the building, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol drug-and people-sniffing dogs indicated spots where people, living or dead, might be trapped. Workers formed human chains to remove debris basket by basket. Rescuers were removing chunks of concrete, broken cinderblocks, shattered glass, merchandise and splintered tables. `` By this time tomorrow morning, the building wo n't be there anymore,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a construction foreman leading the digging effort, said Saturday. `` We're no longer allowing any tunneling. We're in the process of taking apart the building layer by layer.'' By late afternoon, all but about 10 percent of the debris had been removed. Medical workers forced volunteers and rescue workers to take a break because of the 90-degree heat and high humidity. `` We're losing more fluids now than we're taking in,'' said police Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesh </PERSON>, a demolition expert with <ORGANIZATION> Ferromar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> who has assisted in the rescue since Thursday, said workers had to tunnel through three layers of two-inch-thick concrete before reaching the six survivors. <PERSON> Mesh </PERSON> said the store's safe acted like a tent pole and kept the main beam from collapsing on the six.

<HEAD>Excavation Unearths 18th Century Artifacts Near Independence Hall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Excavation at a construction site near Independence Hall has stopped while archaeologists examine a trove of pottery, glass and other artifacts unearthed from an 18th-century privy. Archaeologists said they believe the site was honeycombed with other shafts into which the debris of everyday life in colonial <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was tossed, creating over the decades a layered time capsule of the 18th century. Athough the extent of the find still is unknown, archaeologists are excited. `` I have n't seen the artifacts. I just went down there and eyeballed the privy, and I was very much impressed with it. This could be quite significant,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>, former chief archaeologist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> and curator emeritus of American historical archaeology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees alerted excavators to the presence of the privies _ brick-lined shafts built beneath outhouses. Eight privies and potentially thousands of artifacts in them were destroyed by the latest digging at the site, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Giannini </PERSON>, assistant curator of cermics and glass for the park. But the top of one crumbling, dirt-filled brick shaft was saved when digging was halted Thursday. A 140-bed hotel and 442-car garage, to be operated by <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, is being built at the site by developer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON>. He agreed to stop the excavation after park service employees saw the pottery shards and the privy shafts' brick linings being lifted out by the construction crew. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> members and the developer plan to meet to figure out how to remove the artifacts and allow construction to continue, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, the commission's preservation officer <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> said some privy shafts of the 18th century were actually deep wells illegally used as privies. The area was residential in the 18th century, but in the 19th century was developed into a banking area. Construction of a bank on the site probably caused the razing of the outhouse structures and the destruction of the top of the shafts, <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> said.

 For some of those inside the <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, the discount department store was merely a refuge from a powerful rainstorm. Some of the people killed when the store's roof collapsed had never shopped at the store along a busy commercial section downtown, blocks from the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> border. They ducked inside the three-story building for shelter from the 2 inches of rain that fell in a half hour Thursday afternoon, relatives said. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, 15, vividly recalls the moments before and after the collapse, saying his family never had shopped at the store. `` We were just walking down the street, but we could n't walk anymore because it was raining too hard,'' he said. `` We all got into the store. `` We were five meters inside the store and I was near my cousin, <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON>, and then suddenly there was something like an explosion. It got dark and the walls fell,'' said <PERSON> Davila </PERSON>. `` I saw some light and that's where we climbed out of there,'' he said. `` I expected to see destruction everywhere when I got out, but it was only this building.'' About 100 people were in the store when the 30-ton roof collapsed. At least 14 people were killed and 47 injured. Rescue workers continued clearing debris late Saturday afternoon but said they believed they had recovered all the bodies. Officials had said earlier that 16 people died in the collapse, but revised the figure downward Saturday afternoon. Six survivors were found Friday underneath tons of concrete, twisted steel and broken glass that showered down on them when the roof collapsed. `` It does n't sound like we will find anybody else alive,'' said police spokesman Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON>. Relatives of those trapped had stayed near the scene and prayed, including Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, whose wife, <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON>, and their 4-year-old son, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, had been among the missing. Their 8-year-old daughter <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> was rescued Friday and was recuperating at home. `` She is doing fine,'' Carrera had said. `` But she is just sad that her mother is still in there. We are praying that they will find her and my boy alive.'' But the <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON> family's worst fears were confirmed Saturday when the son's body was found, and later in the day Mrs. <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON>'s body was the 14th to be discovered Services were held Friday for one of the victims, <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musquiz </PERSON>, 77, and two mother-daughter funerals were held Saturday afternoon in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. Among those laid to rest Saturday was 19-year-old <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, who had been deaf since birth, and her mother, <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Brownsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, described <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> as `` very sweet, very likable. She was very easy to get to know and she had a lot of friends. A lot of the children here are expressing some surprise to a lot of this. They ca n't understand why she had to die.'' Among the rescue workers was <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 35, an architect from <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, who helped in the rescue effort during the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquakes in September 1985. `` The mayor wanted to thank me for coming, but I am thankful to him because I am working,'' said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who was granted a visa waiver by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials. `` I like working because I know someone is down there waiting for me,'' he said. `` Whenever I go to a rescue, I know I might not return.''

There are more than 16,000 Vietnamese boat people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. In a new policy announced last month, the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government regards all arriving Vietnamese refugees as illegal immigrants unless they can prove they are fleeing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because of political or religious persecution.

 Eleven-year-old pilot <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> took off from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Saturday on a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, just like his hero, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> _ but with a few stops and a grown-up co-pilot. Bad weather and a thorough mechanical inspection of his <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> 252 two-seater delayed the takeoff from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> until 5 p.m. `` I want to show all the kids in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that if I can do this trip, then they can achieve their dreams too,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> said after arriving at his first stop along the way, <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. He arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday evening after a disconcerting moment when the electrical system shut down for 10 seconds during his approach. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> landed safely, though, and all systems were go Saturday _ onboard video cameras were suspected of having drained the batteries on Friday. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Oceano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has flown from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: BI Bomber Beset By Design Flaws</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 New tests show that the B1 bomber's electronic warfare system has design flaws that could prevent it from reaching the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s planned capabilities for the warplane, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in its Sunday editions, said the flaws detected in the tests could force the Pentagon to reroute possible bombing runs through the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the event of nuclear war. The newspaper cited an internal congressional document written by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., who received a classified <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> briefing late last week on the problems, and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources `` The plane was designed to be capable of a nuclear attack against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` It is now called into question whether it will ever be able to do that mission in the way it was advertised.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said `` the existing system was discovered to be incapable of meeting the ... specification requirements.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> for the weekend and could not be reached for comment by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Pentagon spokeswoman Capt. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laluntas </PERSON> had no comment on the report. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said the tests found that parts of the plane's electronic countermeasures system _ designed to help protect the low-flying, penetrating aircraft on its most critical bombing missions _ does not work and can not be corrected without major changes, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, who has been a critic of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s management of the B1 program, said the test results were a major setback for the $ 28 billion bomber program. The B1 bomber's history has been beset with controversy. The Pentagon began production of the B1, but former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> killed the program, saying it was too costly and was made unnecessary by development of `` Stealth'' bombers designed to make detection difficult. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revived the B1, calling it a critical leg of his strategic plan, and won congressional funding for 100 planes by vowing to keep a ceiling on the price. Since the first bombers became operational in the fall of 1986, the plane has been plagued by problems ranging from its flight controls to its terrain-hugging radar. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> sent committee members a memorandum stating that the recently completed tests, carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, the electronic countermeasures system's builder, revealed `` limitations within the current system architecture'' that will `` prevent the B1 ECM from ever achieving full operational capability,'' the newspaper said. The architecture `` is n't any good and ... it's back to the drawing board,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s ambassador tried to cool the tempers of mourners at an embassy memorial service for the 290 people killed when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot down an Iranian airliner. `` Imam <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> becomes the inheritor on earth of any one of us who is unjustly killed, and only he has the right to decide when and how to take revenge for those innocent victims,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Foumeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeri </PERSON> told hundreds of mourners in the embassy grounds late Thursday. `` Let's not take any hasty action,'' he said in <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, the Iranian language. After an hour of weeping conducted by two poets trained in the mourning ceremony, the crowd chanted: `` <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, we await your orders! Long life to you, death to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>!'' <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is the supreme religious guide for Iranians and leader of the fundamentalist Islamic revolution that ousted the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> in February 1979. <PERSON> Haeri </PERSON>'s appeal for calm coincided with the mood of statements by <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military commander and parliament speaker. He told a prayer meeting Friday Iran would not seek revenge for destruction of the airliner. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to push us to commit the same crime ... but if we did that the world would turn against us,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. `` That is why we do not push to take revenge.

About 150,000 Iranians live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, across the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The memorial service was held in a mosque attached to the new embassy. Its Persian arches were festooned with anti-American slogans.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators failed to reach a new grain agreement in a third round of talks which ended here Friday, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, the head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, announced. Under a five-year agreement that expires on Sept. 30, the Soviets are committed to buying 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain a year, including a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, who is deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, said Friday, `` There remain differences on four major areas in the negotiations. That involves quantities of grain, the pricing of grain, the access of Soviet ships to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports and also expanding Soviet exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He refused to say if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wants to decrease its annual purchasing total. The drought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not a significant issue in the discussions, <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> said in reply to a question. He said that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, explained to the Soviets `` why we have ample stocks and production more than meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic needs and export commitments.'' `` There are a number of signficiant issues where we would like to have changes and where they would like to have changes,'' <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> said, but added, `` I sense a strong desire on both sides for a new agreement.'' The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks lasted two days. Previous negotiating rounds took place in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in March and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in May. <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> told reporters no new talks were scheduled, but he expected negotiations to resume early in September. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation official, speaking on condition of anonymity, put the value of present annual grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at about $ 1.5 billion. <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> said he hoped that before the Soviet negotiations chief, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumakov </PERSON>, goes on vacation on July 25, `` we will know when and where and whether there will be another round of discussions.'' <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting had been useful and `` we made considerable progress in a number of areas. ... But differences still remain.'' The two sides now are now at a stage where they need to review their positions with their governments, said <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, who met reporters at his hotel.

 The Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who is eight months pregnant, escaped injury Friday when her chauffeured <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> struck an oncoming car on a highway 20 miles outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, police and <ORGANIZATION> Buckingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> said. The accident involving the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> occurred on a section of the M40, a busy western highway into <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Part of the road was closed for repairs, police said. A police bodyguard was driving the duchess' <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, and she continued the journey in an accompanying police car, Buckingham Palace said. The 28-year-old duchess is married to <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the second son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. She is expecting their first child. <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> police said later in a statement that the driver of the other car involved was a 31-year-old financial consultant from <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. They did not identify him by name, but said he was taken to <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> police station near the scene of the incident. They said the officers involved formally submitted a report accusing him of careless driving and failing to stop after an accident, with a view to possible prosecution. Police said he took an alcohol test which proved negative. He was later allowed to leave the police station. Police said the car in which the duchess had been riding suffered a punctured front tire and other slight damage. The duchess' pregnancy has undergone other health scares since she fell while skiing in the French alps last March, when she was four months pregnant.

<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> cautioned participating banks on Friday that failure to upgrade aid to the debtor nations would slow their financial growth. `` Unless the banks do more to support adjustment efforts of middle-income counties, the notion that our debt strategy is a collaborative one oriented to growth will not pass serious scrutiny,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said. `` Indeed, it will prevent the resumption of an adequate rate of growth, and all sides will lose,'' he said in a speech prepared for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> endorsed agreements between the debtor nations and creditors for new arrangements to reduce the estimated $ 1.2 trillion debt of certain Third World. The nations with the largest debts are in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> _ where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks are the largest lenders. He expressed concern over difficulties in developing loan packages for those governments trying to adjust to their international debt problems. Such packages usually include loans by the fund itself, by commercial banks and by intergovernmental lenders like the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Adjustments required in return for the loans generally include austerity programs that debtor governments find difficult. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said programs to adjust debtor countries to a better handling of their funds will in many cases have costs in the short run but will eventually help their citizens and particularly the poor. `` The poor would almost certainly suffer much more in the absence of corrective action,'' he said, noting that `` the poor can be protected, at least to some degree by compensatory measures.'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> noted that some adjustment measures are of immediate help to some poor people, such as increased prices for farm products that help the poor in rural areas.

 A <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen-ager last year, raising a storm of protest from the city's black community, was fired from the force Friday by Police Chief <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourget </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bourget </PERSON> told reporters he accepted last month's recommendation by a police disciplinary committee that Constable <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON>, a 16-year veteran of the force, be dismissed for negligence in the arrest and death of 19-year-old <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> last November. The committee said <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON>, 38, pointed his gun at <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> `` without justification,'' then fired, killing him with a single bullet to the forehead. <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> outside a police station after the youth bolted from custody. He obeyed an order to stop but was shot as he turned to face <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON> said the gun went off accidentally. He was suspended from his job and charged with manslaughter. An all-white jury acquitted him in February but the prosecution has appealed the verdict, as Canadian law allows. Protests among <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s 120,000 blacks prompted <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> to order inquiries by the <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The police commission concluded June 9 that <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON> was `` negligent, thoughtless and lacking in vigilance and judgment'' but found no evidence the shooting was racially motivated. Both the commission and the police department's internal disciplinary committee recommended <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON>'s dismissal. <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> has six blacks among its 4,481 police officers. <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON> and a policewoman arrested <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> after a taxi driver complained that a customer refused to pay a fare. A identity check showed <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> was wanted on breaking and entering charges. <PERSON> Gosset </PERSON> and his lawyer, <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Menard </PERSON>, spent two hours with <PERSON> Bourget </PERSON> on Friday in an effort to prevent the dismissal. The police officer's union, the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION>, pledged to fight for his reinstatement.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Friday repeated a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> proposal to withdraw the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from all foreign territory by the year 2000, apparently ruling out any imminent pullout of Russian troops from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and other Soviet bloc countries. The Soviet government chief told Western reporters such moves could come only in the context of a general withdrawal _ involving other nations as well as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He also seemed to dash hopes for any rehabilitation soon of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. His exchanges with the reporters were often acrimonious. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> confirmed that at the recent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed the need for `` socialism with a human face.'' That phrase was used to describe <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s liberal `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' of 1968, which provoked a Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion in August of that year and cost <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> his job as party chief here. Western reporters asked <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who attended a three-day economic conference that ended Thursday, whether the time had not come for <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> to be rehabilitated. He replied: `` The rehabilitation of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, that is a question for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. I do not intend to deal with the internal problems of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. As far as I know the Czechoslovak party does not intend to deal with that.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, now 66, said in an Austrian Television interview broadcast Thursday that the current leadership in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> should adopt <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Most are similar to reforms <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> introduced here 20 years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units are stationed in several Soviet bloc countries, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said his government feels no armies should be on foreign territory _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION>. `` Our proposal is this: let us take out all the armies,'' he said. `` The armies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are part of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact armies. Let us agree on a radical solution in the West and in the East.'' On the theme of `` socialism with a human face,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said: `` Socialism must work for man. All our deeds and our reforms must work for man. We need the participation of man in the whole process. `` A great step has been taken toward democratization, toward glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB-, and that is not possible without man.'' A Soviet journalist complained about lack of information during the conference of <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet bloc equivalent of the European Economic Community. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said he agreed and the practice should be changed `` fundamentally'' because `` 95 percent of our the questions discussed are not in any way secret.'' He expressed hope the next session in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> would be different because `` we really have nothing to hide.'' In reference to communiques issued after Soviet bloc meetings, which rarely reveal differences of opinion, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> declared: `` It is useless to say that 10 countries have the same opinion. This is naive.''

<TEXT>
 Police Friday began arresting 135 people indicted on more than 2,000 felony charges resulting from an undercover investigation that brought in 380 cars valued at more than $ 4 million, authorities said. `` We worked 12 - to 14-hour days buying cars and returning them to the insurance companies,'' said Detective <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Regno </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The rented garage the undercover operation used held only six cars, so officers had to turn the vehicles over to insurance companies quickly, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Regno </PERSON> said. The 16-month undercover operation netted stolen cars from 50 cities as far away as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> has one of the 10 highest auto theft rates in the country, he added. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Regno </PERSON> said police arrested 45 to 50 people Friday and served arrest warrants against 20 other who are already behind bars on other charges. Arrests are expected to continue during the weekend. Those arrested were charged with receiving stolen property and possession of criminal tools, <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant prosecutor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said. Two people who allegedly sold police more than 50 cars each face nearly 100 counts. `` The total number of charges is well over 2,000, but I really have n't kept track,'' she said. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Regno </PERSON> said two undercover police officers set up the operation by contacting alleged thieves through an informant who `` let it be known that if they came across any cars, we were available.'' He said police, who videotaped their car deals in three <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> parking lots, never had to solicit business. Thieves often came to sell cars within hours of stealing them, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Regno </PERSON> said, `` sometimes even before people knew their cars were stolen.'' He said most cars came from young independents known as `` rippers'' who were only interested in `` a quick buck,'' but the large number of cars some sellers turned over made police suspect the involvement of several car theft rings.

<HEAD>Inflation Reaches 41.3 Percent for First Half of 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer prices rose 41.3 percent for the first half of 1988, the business daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiero </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. It tabulated the figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that inflation rose 2 percent in June, slightly above the 1.9 percent increase in May. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Financiero </PERSON>'s report noted that despite an increase in June, figures for both months were the lowest registered since November 1981. Inflation has been reduced by an Economic Solidarity Pact designed by the government in December and endorsed by business and labor. Consumer prices hit a record 159.2 percent last year. President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> announced the program after officials became worried that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was on the verge of spiraling into hyperinflation, a problem that has plagued other Latin American countries. Critics say the pact was intended to artificially control inflation before Wednesday's general elections. The president concludes his six-year term on Nov. 30, with his successor virtually certain to be <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that has governed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929. The budget and planning secretary, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON>, said Wednesday that it will be up to the next administration to decide if the pact continues past November. He told reporters that the agreement remains in effect at least through August and that its status for the last three months of <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>'s term wo n't be determined until the middle of next month. A <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> report issued late Thursday said a beef shortage in turn prompted increases in prices of chicken and pork and so contributed to higher prices, as did a longer than usual dry season that caused increases in fruit and vegetable prices. Among other factors in June's consumer price rises were residential rents, which were 4.3 percent higher and represented the largest single increase, the central bank said. Prices on basic foods and other essentials rose .4 percent. Of the 35 cities checked, the highest increases were 4.3 percent in <LOCATION> Zamora </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state, and 2.5 percent in <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The bank's report said the solidarity pact `` continues being successful in holding down the inflationary process.'' A key component of the inflation-fighting program is a freeze on the minimum wage, prices of government-regulated goods and services and the exchange rate of the peso currency.

<TEXT>
 Before noon last Sunday, Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was at war. His ship, the guided-missile cruiser USS Vincennes, had engaged five Iranian speedboats in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. On the Iranian side of the strait, at the military-civilian airport in <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaian </PERSON> of the airline <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> was revving up his Airbus A300 for a 150-mile hop across the water to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. He had nearly a full load _ 290 passengers and crew. Among the passengers: <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s military attache in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who boarded with his wife and two children; an Iranian couple flying to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> to shop for a daughter's wedding; a woman flying with her eight children to meet her husband, an Iranian merchant in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>; Indians, Afghans, Yugoslavs, an Italian, going about their peaceful business in a region at war. The old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was a place Capt. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> had to keep an eye on. It was becoming an important base for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the 8-year-old conflict with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had moved a few of its hottest fighters _ U.S.-built F-14 Tomcats _ to <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. It also was believed to be a base for anti-ship Silkworm missiles, and the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' assignment was to protect merchant ships from the Silkworms The mix of civilian and military traffic through the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s hazy skies was a headache for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patrols. `` An Iranian F-4 would take off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and right behind it is a commercial aircraft,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran of the Gulf, Rear Adm. R.G. <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>. `` They would both take roughly the same route for a while. Initially it's very difficult to distinguish between the two. We had to be awfully careful for obvious reasons.'' The billion-dollar Aegis-class cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, a major piece of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> muscle, had been in the Gulf only a month. It carried the latest in what <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> jokingly called `` gee-whiz merchandise,'' including phased-array radars designed to simultaneously identify and evaluate the threat from dozens of potential targets. `` Putting this ship with its radar into the gulf will put a lot of battle management on the scene,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> had told reporters who toured the newly arrived vessel. To deal with hostile targets, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> bristled with Harpoon and Standard missiles, anti-submarine rockets, two 5-inch guns and two Phalanx close-in, rapid-fire guns to knock down incoming missiles. `` If it flies, it dies,'' boasted the crew of the first Aegis cruiser. At 10:10 a.m. last Sunday, the Pentagon later reported, Iranian patrol boats fired on a helicopter from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. The patrol boats are 43-foot Boghammar pleasure boats made in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, souped up with big engines, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. At 10:37 a.m., according to Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Satari </PERSON>, the Iranian air force commander, Rezaian switched on the twin engines of the A300 and opened communications with the tower to prepare for takeoff. Five minutes later, by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chronology, the Iranian patrol boats turned toward the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> at high speed and opened fire. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and the frigate <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> returned fire, sinking two patrol boats and damaging a third. At 10:45 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655 was airborne, and within two minutes the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was checking it out by radar. Quickly reviewing the data from the `` gee-whiz merchandise,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> concluded that the blip was an attacking F-14. He gave the order to fire, and one of two SM-2 Standard missiles from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> scored a kill. It was then 10:54 a.m., 2:54 a.m. in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At 3:45 a.m. EDT, the White House `` situation room'' notified national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and other officials of the incident. At 4:52 a.m., <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> woke up President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at Camp David to report that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces believe they had shot down an Iranian jet fighter. Meanwhile, news reports from the region quoted shipping sources as saying an Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> had crashed in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Within an hour, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that the plane had been `` downed by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. forces.'' At the <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> airport, a shipping executive reported seeing dozens of people crowding the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air booth for information about the overdue plane. Among them, the executive told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, was the Iranian merchant. `` The man just went out of his mind, going from pillar to post and banging his head,'' the executive said. Shortly before 8 a.m. EDT, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, told reporters that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank two patrol boats and shot down an F-14. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are aware of the Iranian claim, he added, `` and we're checking it out.'' At 8:11 a.m., <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was given a written update, noting the Iranian claim. At 9:50 a.m. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was notified that the target apparently was a civilian aircraft. In the early afternoon, the president issued a statement saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, `` in a proper defensive action,'' unintentionally shot down a passenger plane. `` The course of the Iranian civilian airliner was such that it was headed directly for the USS Vincennes, which was at the time engaged with five Iranian Boghammar boats that had attacked our forces. When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> followed standing orders and widely publicized procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement said. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, in a message back to the States: `` This is a burden that I will carry the rest of my life, but I took this action to defend my ship and my crew. I alone am responsible.''

<HEAD>New Developments in Boesky Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tentacles from the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal surfaced in a surprising way this past week with the indictment of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for stock manipulation. Securities lawyers said such charges against a large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial company are highly unusual and suggest the government is toughening and expanding its crackdown on Wall Street corruption. At the same time, however, they said stock manipulation is always difficult to prove and that federal prosecutors could face a time-consuming and possibly embarassing court fight with <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a major producer of chemicals and building materials based in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The 10-count indictment returned by a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal grand jury last Wednesday against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, vice chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> and two subsidiaries alleges they manipulated <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock in 1986 after a failed takeover attempt of the much larger chemical company. The object of the purported scheme was to induce other investors to buy Carbide shares and thereby inflate the price, so <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> could sell its 10 percent stake at a better profit or with minimal loss, the indictment alleges. If convicted on all counts, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> could face $ 15 million in fines, while <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> could face a 50-year prison term and $ 2.5 million in fines. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> have proclaimed innocence and vowed to contest the charges. It is the first indictment brought against an American industrial concern stemming from evidence supplied indirectly by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, a well-known stock speculator now serving a three-year prison term for his central role in the biggest insider trading case in history. The connection between <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, former head of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> brokerage that bears his name. He was implicated by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> after the speculator agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who also has pleaded guilty to criminal charges and is cooperating with the government, is the main source of information that led federal prosecutors to investigate <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>. `` This appears to be part of the government's pattern of looking at market practices of all kinds,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a securities attorney at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Gibson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s task force on insider-trading regulation. `` We're seeing more of that and more focus on it,'' he said. `` This also shows that prosecutors are continuing to reap the benefits of deals they made with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION>.'' Nevertheless, securities lawyers said that in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case, one of the main legal challenges facing the government will be to prove a conspiracy existed to influence the price of Carbide's stock. Carbide is one of the largest publicly held companies and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, with more than 127 million common shares. On any given day, its stock price could change for a number of innocuous reasons, ranging from an analyst's earnings estimate to a stock-buyback rumor Some people familiar with the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> indictment, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said a second potential problem facing the government is its possible use of <LOCATION> Jefferies </LOCATION> as a witness. Because Jefferies is an admitted felon, defense lawyers could successfully destroy his credibility before a jury. A third problem confronting prosecutors is whether the alleged manipulation succeeded. The government claims Carbide shares rose in price as a result, although records show <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> did n't sell its stake until several days later. Several attorneys said they doubted prosecutors would have sought an indictment unless they had much more than evidence supplied by <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>. Others also noted that, unlike civil cases, rules concerning evidence in criminal matters are biased in the government's favor. The defendants may not know until trial what incriminating material the prosecutors will present. `` I have to assume that if it's a criminal case, the government will be ready to go to trial, and the judge will certainly push the case to trial relatively quickly,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Walpin </PERSON>, a partner at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Rosenman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> and a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. `` I think certainly within six months we'll know exactly what the government's case is.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> indictment was n't the only development in the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal this past week. Speculation heightened that the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was about to file civil charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street investment firm that has been under government investigation for months. Another <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> conspirator, inside trader <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, was transferred from prison to serve the remainder of his two-year term in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> halfway house. But in a setback for <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a federal judge ruled he must use his $ 12.8 million in illicit profits to repay defrauded investors and not back taxes, which total $ 12.2 million in federal claims alone.

 After weeks of playing follow-the-soybeans, traders in a number of commodity markets are looking elsewhere for signals on whether to buy or sell. Some of these markets, such as gold and sugar, have only a marginal interest in grain and soybean prices to begin with. Others _ cotton in particular _ have almost no real relationship to soybeans and are cooling down after a frantic ride on the drought train, courtesy of market speculators. The Midwestern drought remains the dominant influence in the grain and soybean markets and in the livestock markets, where the price of feed grain is directly related to production costs. But the drought's diminishing impact on the prices of other commodities illustrates how the powerful psychology of a runaway market can sweep others along with it _ until the facts get in the way. `` In the end, the fundamentals always reign supreme,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, cotton specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In the cotton market, the fundamentals include the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s prediction of a 5.6 million-bale surplus on July 31, the end of the current marketing year, and a whopping 6.8 million-bale surplus a year later. There is nearly enough cotton in storage to fulfill all of next year's expected domestic demand, twice as much as experts consider adequate. Before the drought began, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated 1988-89 cotton production at 14 million bales. Analysts say even severe drought damage would n't reduce the oversupply. `` We could lose 2 -LCB- million bales and not be hurt,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, cotton specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. So why did near-month cotton futures follow the soybean market's sharp springtime surge, rallying from about 60 cents a pound on April 15 to almost 70 cents by June 20 `` Cotton very often is called soybean's little brother,'' <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. `` It follows it slavishly.'' Added <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON>, cotton analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>: `` It was n't so much the fabulous buying that brought the prices up, it was that you did n't have anybody willing to sell it. That allowed the speculative element to move prices higher in tandem with the other markets.'' Cotton futures prices have since come back down to around 60 cents a pound. `` People finally became convinced the fundamentals had been ignored too long, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. The inflation-sensitive gold market followed a similar, albeit shorter path. In early June, gold for August delivery surged above its recent $ 440-to - $ 460 trading range to more than $ 470 a troy ounce The accepted explanation was that traders feared the sharp rise in grain prices would lead to greater inflation. Those worries were quickly calmed by economists, who pointed out the miniscule impact of food prices on the Consumer Price Index, and gold prices eased back into their well-worn trading range. `` The soybean market and the rally we had in previous weeks certainly constituted a psychological inducement to rally the precious metals. But in general you have to keep the advance in perspective,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The gold market indicated ... that food-inspired increases alone were not going to boost inflation rates to dangerously high levels.'' In fact, commodity markets almost never take their direction from a single source and single-day moves often have no easy explanation, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronowitz </PERSON>, director of futures research for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The media naturally wants to know why gold is up a dollar today or why it's down a dollar,'' he said. `` Sometimes there is no reason. But when they're at a loss to explain a move, analysts will tend to tie it to something else.''

<HEAD>With Unemployment Down, Pressure Building For Bigger Wage Demands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After a long break from inflation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is entering the early phase of a new cycle of quickly rising prices, some economists now say. A resurgence of inflation may take a year or more, but if it does set in again, it might not be stoppable by anything short of a government-induced recession, these economists say. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has defied expectations of trouble many times before during this record, nearly 6-year-long expansion, and it may do so again. The bond market, which is the most sensitive barometer of inflation, has been fairly calm lately. Interest rates are down from their highs of late May. But inflation alarms went up Friday when the government reported that the nation's civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in June, its lowest level in 14 years. The report added to inflationary concerns caused by the export-led boom in manufacturing, which has resulted in bottlenecks and spotty shortages. Meanwhile, industrial commodity prices have jumped 25 percent in the past two years. A low jobless rate means employers are having trouble finding and keeping qualified workers. By the laws of supply and demand, that means wages could start rising rapidly. American workers have been tolerating low wage increases for so long that some economists have concluded that they have permanently lowered their expectations. In the last year, for example, wages rose 3.2 percent, failing to keep up with a roughly 4.4 percent increase in consumer prices. In June, the average hourly wage rate in private industry was no higher than the May rate: $ 9.27 an hour. At some point, though, the tables are likely to turn. Workers will be in such demand that they will be able to insist on pay increases that help them catch up, or at least stop falling farther behind. And since wage costs account for about 55 percent of the cost of production, big pay increases could push the economy into an inflationary cycle. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, labor economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, says the `` startling'' June jobless rate is probably a quirk caused by an underestimate of the size of the labor force. He says there is no strong evidence of a tight labor market. But <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Wages are slow to react, but when they turn, they turn decisively and rapidly and then they're hard to contain.'' Hunt was the most pessimistic on inflation of 32 economists included in a forecasting chart published last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, predicting an inflation rate of 6.8 percent in the first half of 1989. Still, even economists who are relatively optimistic say the situation is worsening. `` There are a lot of little pieces of evidence that inflation is starting to accelerate,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>, an economist for <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The drop in the dollar from its 1985 peak has created strong demand for American-made products and strained the production capacity of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories. The dollar's recent rise could take off some of the edge, but it may not last. Adding to the strain is the huge federal budget deficit, which has become more of a problem now that the economy is already in danger of overheating. When the government spends more than it takes in, it can overstimulate an economy that is barely coping with strong private demand. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said the government should try to slash the federal deficit to less than $ 100 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, but realistically expects the gap to spread to as much as $ 180 billion. With government spending out of control, the only remedy for inflation is on the supply side. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, not known for its finesse, would have to cool off the economy by jacking up interest rates, very likely choking off the historic expansion, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` We're in the early stages of an insurgence of inflation,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` This is the equivalent of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> inflation of the mid -'60s, the early stages of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> inflation of late'72, and the early stages of the Carter inflation around 1977 or 1978

<HEAD>Wall Street Uninspired by `Banner Year'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though the stock market has rallied since late spring, Wall Street is still having trouble working up much excitement over what President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has labeled a `` banner year for peace and prosperity.'' The occasion for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement was a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Friday that the civilian unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point in June to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent. That figure, and the accompanying news of a 346,000 increase in non-farm payroll employment, far exceeded advance estimates on Wall Street. The dramatic numbers seemed to leave the stock market with a clearly defined choice: Either it could jump ahead on the evidence of solid economic growth, or it could drop sharply amid the inflation fears that have been raised by many other favorable economic reports of late. As it turned out, however, the market did neither of those things. Instead, it spent the day drifting quietly lower, almost as though there was no news of any note to deal with. One primary source of caution in the financial markets of late has been a widespread suspicion that the state of the economy is too good to last. Before long, many investors fear, strong growth will bring with it increased inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. Indeed, rates moved up significantly on Friday after the employment statistics were issued. To some analysts, this amounts to nothing more than the latest of a series of false inflation scares that have hit the markets in recent years. Yes, they say, the rise of the Consumer Price Index in 1988 is likely to be a little larger than it was last year, with production closer to full capacity and special influences like the drought in the farm belt. But no, they argue, inflation is not about to reach the point where it forces stringent credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and brings an end to the economic expansion. `` The economic cycle will last longer than any investors expect,'' maintains <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` Peak earnings are still several quarters away. Inflationary pressures from some commodity prices are offset by weakness in energy. `` Interest rates are unlikely, anytime soon, to reach levels that would dampen the economy.'' Such assurances did little for the stock market in the past week, however. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 25.43 points to 2,106.15. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index fell .87 to 152.81, and the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market lost .37 to 394.33. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index edged up .02 to 309.02. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 163.40 million shares a day, down from 208.42 million the week before. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Tucker </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R.L. Day Inc. takes a different slant on the inflation debate: She regards fears of upward pressure on prices as misguided, but thinks the stock market is headed for trouble anyway. Ms. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> argues that the basic question facing the stock market is how the nation will deal with `` the greatest debt problem this country has faced since the late 1920s. `` Since the early 1980s,'' she says, `` deflation has been a greater risk than inflation, particularly in light of the debt problem.'' But, in her view, fears of inflation could lead policymakers, notably the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, to take actions that would turn many heavy debtors into bankrupts. She concludes, `` The risk is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will tighten, raise the discount rate, at a time when free market forces are already pulling in the direction of deflation rather than inflation.''

<HEAD>Low Unemployment Rate Raises Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Droves of teen-agers on summer employment rolls helped push the nation's unemployment rate to a 14-year low in June, but the news rekindled inflation fears and sent stock and bond prices tumbling. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday before trading began on Wall Street that the unemployment rate for June stood at 5.3 percent. The unexpectedly strong report sent the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials down 16.54 points to a close at 2,106.15 in light trading. Concern that inflation might rise as the economy heats up also rippled through the credit markets, where the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue fell about $ 10 per $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield jumped to 9.09 percent from 9.00 percent late Thursday. But the unemployment report was welcomed in the currency markets, where the dollar jumped despite central bank intervention. Traders reasoned that a big reported rise in manufacturing employment was an indication that exports remained strong, which could help shrink the trade deficit and support the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the sharp drop from May's 5.6 percent jobless rate was caused by a seasonally adjusted surge of 820,000 people _ three-fourths of them youths 16 to 24 years old _ onto the nation's payrolls. Joblessness among black youths plummeted more than 6 percentage points to its lowest level on record. Analysts had anticipated a large increase this year in the number of available summer jobs, especially in the tourist industry, as foreigners taking advantage of the devalued dollar flock to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for their vacations. In other economic developments Friday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported that Americans increased their installment borrowing at a modest annual rate of 4.6 percent in May, as growth in consumer credit slowed from the rapid expansion of earlier this year Consumers took out $ 2.42 billion more in credit than they paid off in May, compared with net growth of $ 3.85 billion in April. _ Oil futures turned mixed in moderate trading as dealers reassessed the impact of the recent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rig explosion on petroleum supplies and prospects for an emergency <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting diminished On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for August delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 37 cents to $ 15.46 per 42-gallon barrel.

 Oil futures gave up some of their recent gains as dealers reassessed the impact of the recent <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rig explosion on petroleum supplies and prospects for an emergency <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting diminished. `` It may be a case of calmer heads prevailing today,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an oil analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of Friday's trading session Prices for petroleum futures and contracts for refined products had soared on Thursday as traders reacted to reports that the <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> rig explosion would affect about 12 percent of total <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> production, or as much as 300,000 barrels of oil per day. In addition, there was concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> countries might call an emergency meeting to discuss overproduction among some of its members. `` I think they over-reacted to the effects of the platform fire and they realized it really did n't mean that much ... and the gains were given back,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, an energy analsyt with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think the market also realized there was n't going to be an emergency meeting.'' As a result, he said, Friday's trading was highlighted by profit-taking and a general correction from Thursday's overbought condition. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for August delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude oil fell 37 cents to $ 15.46 per 42-gallon barrel after closing 47 cents higher on Thursday. The contract had traded well above $ 16 during that session. Among refined products traded on the exchange, home heating oil fell 0.90 cent to 43.39 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline rose 0.05 cent to 53.17 cents a gallon. Analysts attributed the slight rise to reports of strong seasonal demand.
