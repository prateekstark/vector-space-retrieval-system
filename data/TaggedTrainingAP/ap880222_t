<HEAD>Socialist Party Leadership Suggests Waldheim Must Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership on Monday strongly suggested President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> should step down but stopped short of calling for his resignation. Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, party chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinowatz </PERSON> and other party leaders also renewed an indirect offer to support a conservative candidate to be nominated for presidential elections if <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> quits. The resolution adopted by the Socialist leadership meeting said the report of a historians' commission on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s service in the German army during World War II had `` badly shaken the president's moral authority at home and abroad. It also said that a televised speech by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on Feb. 15 `` has raised doubts about his ability to integrate'' <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s opposing political camps In that speech, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said he would not step down and dismissed as wrong unspecified parts of the report earlier this month by the international panel of historians that probed his wartime past. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, 69, has consistently denied any wrongdoing as a first lieutenant serving in the German army in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during the war. The resolution said the Socialists are ready, together with the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, junior partner in the coalition government, to `` look for a way toward a new beginning in the office of federal president.'' Asked whether this meant that the Socialists would agree to a joint conservative presidential candidate, <PERSON> Sinowatz </PERSON> told reporters `` this certainly includes also the question whether a personnel change is possible.'' Economics Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> and other leading officials of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last week expressed increasing uneasiness in the party about the damage being done to the country if <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> clings to his post. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, elected in 1986, ends his term in 1992. The historians' commission presented no evidence that would clearly back allegations <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed atrocities, but it left open the question of whether he was guilty of any crime. It said he was `` in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt ot prevent them. It also said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> concealed his wartime past and tried to make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds a 2-1 lead over chief rival Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the 14 Southern and border states that hold primaries on March 8, Super Tuesday, a poll indicated Monday. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were running roughly even in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> survey suggested. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the nationwide favorite among Democrats, according to another poll, this one by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. According to that survey, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 21 percent; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 13 percent; Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 12 percent and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 10 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> were the leaders in the Southern and border Super Tuesday states, garnering 19 percent and 16 percent respectively, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 13 percent; <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 11 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 10 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated. In the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> survey, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> by a 51-26 margin, with former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was third with 11 percent. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trailed with 3 percent and 9 percent were undecided, the poll indicated. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll of Super Tuesday states plus <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, findings were similar: 51 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 20 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. In the nationwide sampling the survey found 42 percent opting for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 27 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The Scripps Howard pollsters contacted 423 likely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters Feb. 17-19, just after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Feb. 16 primary. The margin of error on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side was 5 percentage points, the news service said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, eight days after a bruising third-place finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Among Democrats, the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> survey gave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 22 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 19 percent _ within the poll's 4 percentage-point margin of error. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the decisive winner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has pinned his hopes on a strong showing in the South, and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman who won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and placed second in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, each had 14 percent, and 21 percent were undecided, the news service said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> had 6 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> drew the backing of 5 percent. On the Democratic side, 597 voters were surveyed during the same time period as the Republican polling. The <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> survey involved voters in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, all of which hold primaries or caucuses on March 8.

<HEAD>No Bon Jovi, No REM _ Grammys Ignore Critics and Charts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Eight million Americans can be wrong. That's how many people bought <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON>'s album `` Slippery When Wet,'' which spent 38 weeks in the Top 5 of the album charts and churned out three hit singles. But the boys from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> received a goose egg from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which deemed `` Slippery When Wet'' worthy of zero Grammy nominations. And it's not just the platinum-haired, platinum-sellers the academy ignores: Critical favorites can and often do suffer the same fate The Beatles, one of the most popular and prolific musical entities of the century, were often ignored by the academy, winning only four <PERSON> Grammys </PERSON> as a group. The Rolling Stones have never won a Grammy. REM, the acclaimed band from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, broke nationally with their `` Document'' album and its single, `` The One I Love''; their album also received no nominations. However, the LP cover was nominated for best album package. An assortment of artists, from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON> to The Beastie Boys, missed out on musical nominations for the March 2 show at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, passed over by a membership which `` once more opted for studio craft over originality and vision,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> music critic <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilburn </PERSON>. `` You know what it is? It's just the way it is. You ca n't fight city hall,'' said rocker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, who was snubbed for a best new artist nomination on a technicality. `` It does tend to be the same kind of people every year,'' he said. `` A lot of times it's the people who've been on the cover of Time, or the real mainstream people. The artistic people are passed over many times.'' For <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, it was an obscure track he recorded for a B-movie soundtrack that prevented his new artist nomination. A similar controversy arose in 1986 when the academy refused to nominate <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> in the best new artist category because she had recorded duets with <PERSON> Jermaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>. She went on to win the best female pop vocal Grammy for `` Saving All My Love for You.'' But <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who won the award in 1969, had been vocalists and songwriters in the <ORGANIZATION> Byrds </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and the Hollies. <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>, who won in 1985, recorded as lead vocalist with a group called Blue Angel before her `` She's So Unusual'' LP. And <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was nominated in that category in 1986, had been a part of a recording group called Mystic <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON>. Nevertheless, singer <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> _ who scored several hits while recording with the band <ORGANIZATION> Shalimar </ORGANIZATION> _ was nominated as a new artist this year. `` I was upset for about five minutes when I found out. Then I thought, ` Well, no big deal. I'll get nominated for a Grammy someday,''' said <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, who wound up nominated this year for best rock vocal with his track, `` Do n't Mean Nothing.'' His competition in that category includes <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> and superstar <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>. But even The Boss was a victim of the fickle Grammy selection process. <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s `` Tunnel of Love,'' his first studio album in three years, was passed over for album for the year honors. But `` Paradise by the C,'' an old tune recycled on <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s five-record live set, inexplicably received a best rock instrumental nomination In fact, <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> has received only one Grammy Award, despite such multimillion selling and critically hailed albums as `` Born to Run,'' `` The River'' and `` Born in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' As for <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON>, his fine `` The Lonesome Jubilee'' received no nominations; <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON> received a co-nomination for producer of the year with his studio partner, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s office has declined to comment on the nomination process, which is handled by the 5,000-member <ORGANIZATION> NARAS </ORGANIZATION>. The selection of nominees and the winners annually produces complaints from those passed over, although many artists remain philosophical about the whole process. `` Look at all the people who won in the best new artist category in the past _ the <ORGANIZATION> Starland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, A Taste of Honey,'' said <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. `` That award can be the kiss of death.''

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> works in a junkyard six days a week, tearing apart old cars and rebuilding the engines. The other day is spent working in the fields at a church-run orphanage, where his benefactors have volunteered his service. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, 75, and his wife, <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON>, 68, gave him the job and a chance to leave the lean-to he was living in last month with other homeless men in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. They gave him the old 8-foot-by-30-foot trailer home at the junkyard that he shares with a stray cat he's named <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON>. They have their son <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> drive him to church on Sundays. They pay for his groceries, but they have n't paid him any wages yet. `` Those Gilmans believe in working,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says, adding that a paycheck will probably come when business picks up. `` A month from now, it'll be planting season,'' he says. `` I think I'll do good. I'm fed, I'm healthy, I'm working.'' Room and board are <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>'s pay for now, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> will be paid `` when he gets where he can do anything. ... I think we're going in the hole part of the time now.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is a stranger in a strange land, and the circumstances that brought him here on Jan. 16 were just as strange. Before he arrived in this ranching and farming community of about 11,000 people on the flat high plains of eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> lived in a rotting wood and canvas shack along the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He did n't have a job and he got his meals when he could. A 2-inch scar across his forehead is testimony to a fight he says started in a soup line in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The Gilmans read of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' plight in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> story published in the Portales News-Tribune in January, contacted the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and said if <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was willing to work they'd provide him with a home and a job By the time <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 35, was on a westbound Greyhound people had donated new clothes, new luggage and spending money. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is n't completely at ease in his new surroundings. He is n't quite sure how people will react to him. He shunned a suggestion of one restaurant for dinner, saying he'd heard `` rough cowboys'' hung out there. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> likes to talk about his past. He speaks with animation of his days as a wanderer, traveling through the South looking for work. He speaks also of a future when he will own his own ranch. But for now, he goes to work at the junkyard each day and says he enjoys the time he spends in the fields at the orphanage. When the director of the orphanage drives up to the remains of an old corral that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is sawing into firewood, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> quickly extinguishes his cigarette in his calloused hand, saying putting it out is the respectful thing to do. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is nice and warm,'' he says. `` I want to stay here and try to make something out of this opportunity. `` I ai n't getting no younger. I want to settle down.'' Since his arrival, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has received dozens of letters: from women who've read of his good fortune and want to share life with him, from homeless people wishing him well in his new life, from 28 fifth graders in <LOCATION> Corrales </LOCATION>, N.M. The Gilmans also get letters _ mostly commending them for offering <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> the opportunity to work again and to have a roof over his head. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a burly 5-foot-10-inch former carpenter, answers his letters, particularly those from the women. `` I get lonely for a woman,'' he says. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> saves her letters in a notebook that she likes to show visitors. People in the community have been receptive to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, she says, but adds: `` So many people want his place if he does n't work out. If he does n't get started drinking, he'll be all right.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is n't drinking. He ca n't go out to bars at night because the 16-year-old car the Gilmans gave him does n't have an engine yet. But he's learning the skills he'll need to get it in working order. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is a good worker but still needs time to adjust to his new job. `` Some things could be better,'' he says. `` I think there's a communication gap, but a bunch of that is probably my fault. He ca n't read my mind. `` A lot of it is the way he's lived,'' <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> says. `` His brain has worked on survival for the last couple of years. He's got to develop it for this now.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> begins each day at 8 a.m. by helping feed the half dozen cows that also live at the junkyard. When warm weather comes he'll help with ranching chores on the approximately 2,000 acres the Gilmans own in several tracts. `` He's not completely satisfied. I can tell,'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> says. `` Other days things are good. There's ups and downs.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says the downs come mostly when he begins missing his longtime girlfriend and her 16-year-old daughter he helped raise. They live in a government housing project in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I want to help my stepdaughter out, she's pregnant,'' he says. `` I'd like to try and save my money and do something for my own. I'd like to bring them down here. `` I never knew I'd end up like I did,'' he says. `` I hope I do n't end up in a slump like that again. That ai n't no kind of life for a man.''

 In her `` Saturday Night Live'' heyday, <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> poked fun at people and just about everything else, but when she learned 17 months ago that she had cancer she found life was not as funny. `` Cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world,'' <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> said in an interview in March's Life magazine. `` But it does n't have to mean you die. Although <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> had lost much weight and hair during her chemotherapy, she has a new attitude today. `` Radner needs little provocation to yank up her sweater and show off her newly ` fat' stomach, and after eight months of baldness, her unruly brown hair -LRB- with a bit of gray at the temples -RRB- has grown back in a thick thatch,'' according to the magazine. She has also stopped smoking and eats more wholesome food. Twenty years ago, the average life expectancy of a patient with ovarian cancer was between six and seven months. It is still the most lethal of pelvic cancers, with less than a 30 percent recovery rate. Although <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, 41, will not be considered well unless her remission continues for at least 1 -LCB- years, she said `` I think I've never been as healthy and as well as I am now. She credits her turnaround to her excruciating medical treatment, which included surgery, nine months of chemotherapy injections and 30 radiation sessions. Her 52-year-old husband, actor <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, said: `` Each time <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> had to go through one more treatment, and she'd be vomiting and writhing in pain, I'd ask myself, ` How much can a human being take?''' Had Wilder not been around, <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> is certain she could not have taken so much, the magazine said. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has not worked since she was diagnosed. <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> also credits meetings she's attending with the `` Wellness Community,'' a cancer self-help group. And she's working three hours a day on a book about cancer. `` That's what one of my favorite visualizations is about,'' she said. `` Every day ... I imagine myself sitting in Doubleday's, with people lined up to have me sign my book. I'm well. And I'm adorable.

 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did n't spare the fire-and-brimstone when fellow TV evangelists <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> fell from power last year. He criticized them for their style as well as their sexual dalliances. `` God deliver us from these pompadour boys, hair done, nails done, fresh from the beauty shop, preaching the gospel,'' he thundered in March at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> crusade. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who temporarily stepped down from his own ministry Sunday amid allegations of sexual misconduct, has a less polished, more explosive fundamentalist style. It sprang, perhaps, from his upbringing in <LOCATION> Ferriday </LOCATION>, a backwater town in northern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s Bible belt It was there, he has said, when he first heard the call of God _ a voice that gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle. He was 8 years old. `` Everything seemed different after that day in front of the Arcade Theater,'' he said in a 1985 interview. `` I felt better inside. Almost like taking a bath.'' He grew up poor and learned to play the piano and sing along with two cousins who took different paths _ rock singer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and country singer <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>. Part-time preaching and part-time work in oil fields provided his living until he was 23, when he gave up the oil work. He preached, played piano and sang gospel songs with all the barrelhouse fervor of his cousin <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings for 16 years before starting a radio show that launched his broadcast evangelism career. He was always outspoken. In literature issued by his ministry he calls Roman Catholicism `` a false religion. It is not the Christian way. Whosoever follows its errant doctrines will be deceived and end up eternally lost.'' Of Jews, he wrote that `` because of their rejection of Christ ... they have known sorrow and heartache like have no other people on the face of the Earth.'' `` If you do n't like what I say, talk to my boss!'' he shouted once as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center, where his sermons often move listeners to stand up as though possessed by the Holy Spirit and start speaking in tongues. Offensive to some, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s messages still moved many. Contributors built <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries into a growth industry that made an estimated $ 142 million in 1986. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in 1985 that his complex in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> _ including a worship center, <PERSON> Bible </PERSON> college and state-of-the-art broadcasting and recording facilities _ was worth up to $ 75 million. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has said the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> scandals of last year hurt fund-raising because the public painted all evangelists with a broad brush. As the scandal broke, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> assured his followers that he would n't fall into the same trap as <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> minister. In his <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> worship center in March he told his flock that if he were ever unfaithful to his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, she would `` kill me before God could even get to me.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> never specifially responded to reports that he, too, had been accused of sexual misconduct, specifically consorting with a prostitute. But, as his tearful followers looked on, he turned to his wife and said, `` God never gave a man a better helpmate, a companion to stand beside him. I have sinned against you and I beg your forgiveness.''

<TEXT>
 This town of cobblestone streets and sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their sins in its holy lake. <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> is a place revered by Hindus and even by some foreigners who seek out its tranquility. Its beginnings lie with <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>, the creator of the universe in Hindu mythology. Hindu texts have it that when <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> was seeking a place for a holy ceremony, he chose <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON>. He dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the desert to form a lake, according to the texts that date from the 8th century B.C. In these modern times, as the sun rises, <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> pilgrims chant mantras and take a dip in <LOCATION> Pushkar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, believing all their sins will be washed away by the holy waters. Europeans and Americans often are seen by the lake, sharing the religious experience. They feed grain to pigeons and sweets to long-tailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the town's 400 temples where ascetics, Hindu monks and other holy men gather <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON>, a town of 9,000 people, is an oasis of tranquility, far removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>. The blazing sun soaks into everything. It was the sacred month of <PERSON> Kartik </PERSON>, signifying the onset of winter, when <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> is said to have dropped his lotus blossom. <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>, foremost in the Hindu trinity of supreme gods, had been looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony. But his wife, <PERSON> Savitri </PERSON>, could not attend the ritual. Angered, she decreed that henceforth <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> would be worshiped at only one place. <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of creation, while millions of shrines were erected across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to Lord Shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like <PERSON> Kali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Durga </PERSON> who are often depicted as fire-spitting images carrying heads of evil men they had slain in battle. But this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for the Hindus, almost equal in importance to <ORGANIZATION> Benaras </ORGANIZATION>, the `` eternal city.'' Hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in <LOCATION> Benaras </LOCATION>. Pilgrims come by the thousands to <LOCATION> Pushkar </LOCATION>, 250 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>'s majestic rite every year on <PERSON> Kartik </PERSON> <PERSON> Poornima </PERSON>, the full moon night in the month of November. Shielded by <PERSON> Nag </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahar </PERSON>, or <ORGANIZATION> Serpent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> has <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s _ and perhaps the world's _ only temple to <LOCATION> Brahma </LOCATION> The town centers on the lake, where there are several steps for bathing. Signs warn foreigners `` not to wear shorts and other revealing clothes, not to smoke, drink near the lake or take photographs, not to kiss, embrace or indulge in other irreverent acts.'' The steps, called ghats, are controlled by vigilant and aggressive brahmin priests, who preside over religious ceremonies, armed with horoscopes. They watch every pilgrim approaching the lake and pounce on potential clients. Each visit is recorded in their bulky, cloth-covered books. A priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> by referring to the dog-eared notebooks. Displeasing a priest can be unpleasant. He will pronounce curses on one's entire family, naming all _ the grandfather, father and sons. From the lake, the steps lead up to the main street, a favorite shopping center with the tourists. The shops are stacked with exotic handicrafts, peasant skirts and other clothes native to this part of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Velvet shirts and pajamas, musts for low-budget travelers, hang in vibrant displays.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, elected as <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' fourth president since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 28 years ago, had never belonged to a political party or been involved in political activity until he decided to run for office The 56-year-old millionaire businessmen ran as an independent backed by the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AKEL </ORGANIZATION>, which controls about one-third of the votes among the 363,000 voters on the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> side of the divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. On Sunday, he defeated a veteran conservative politician to become the nation's leader. Until his campaign, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> concentrated on his research and marketing company, worth about $ 5 million. It is the largest in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The campaign was a first for the communists as well. Until this poll, the party had always supported centrist candidates, never fielding its own man. But the millionaire's endorsement by the communists was not as contradictory as it sounds. His parents, <PERSON> Vassos </PERSON>, an eye doctor, and <PERSON> Phofo </PERSON>, a dentist, were founding members of the party in 1941. His father took the family to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1945 to fight on the communist side in the civil war. The pro-European <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> has stressed his political independence from the communists, particularly on foreign policy, and is expected to adhere to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' non-aligned status. The election of the urbane <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, an economist who speaks seven languages, breaks the Greek Cypriot nationalists' grip on power since independence. The island's first president, Archbishop <PERSON> Makarios </PERSON>, hero of the independence struggle in the 1950s, was elected for three five-year terms with huge majorities. His successor, <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, was considered his political heir and served for two terms _ but only with <ORGANIZATION> AKEL </ORGANIZATION> support, which was withdrawn in 1985. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>'s election breaks the mold. He has said his first priority is to break the deadlock between <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriots and seek to reunite the island. It has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in 1974, after a short-lived coup by militant supporters of union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> that installed <PERSON> Nicos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> as president for eight days. All efforts to find a political settlement have foundered. But <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> has said he will form a national unity government and is willing to reopen negotiations without preconditions. <PERSON> Vassilou </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Famagusta </LOCATION>, now part of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in the northern third of the island, was educated in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He is married with three children.

<HEAD>A Year After His Death, Warhol's Legacy Mirrors his Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pop artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, who gained fame by calling fame fleeting, has proved otherwise by his death. A year after his fatal heart attack in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospital, <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s legacy is a mirror of his life: a melange of high art, low kitsch, dramatic tension and, as much as ever, the gaze of a fascinated public. `` It's going to take a while still for his legacy to be sorted out,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourdon </PERSON>, an art critic and <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> biographer. `` But if anybody thought he was going to be a flash in the pan, they are quite mistaken.'' Artistically, scrutiny of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s work has risen to a level it probably never attained in his life. Major film and painting retrospectives are in the works, as are several biographies and the publication of his private journal. Socially, the cultish lifestyle in which <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> enveloped himself will be unwrapped this spring at a huge auction of the artist's possessions, from Old Master paintings to a Superman touch-tone phone. Commercially, the managers of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s estate have signed a licensing agreement that principals say could create a billion-dollar business in retail goods, from calendars to towels, bearing <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> images. And legally, in its least expected ramification, <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s death continues to reverberate in the medical world. The state has accused <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of rendering him deficient care, and his estate has sued over his death. `` What would he think of all this? As far as the brouhaha is concerned, it's consistent with the way he lived _ action, tension, all those kinds of things,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, lawyer for the estate. `` But in terms of his death? He'd probably just think his death was stupid.'' <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, 58, died in his hospital bed early Feb. 22, 1987, the day after a surgeon removed his gall bladder. Pathologically fearful of hospitals and distrustful of doctors, he had put off the surgery for years. His death remains an enigma. The city coroner was unable to say what caused <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s heart to stop, and the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, while citing deficient care, did not say the problems _ such as inadequate supervision of nurses and incomplete record-keeping _ harmed him. `` There are cases when cardiac arrest is unexplained. This will probably be one of those cases,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the hospital, which maintains that <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> was well cared for. In some ways, the inconclusiveness of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s death is fitting. His life was equally enigmatic, a mix of nightclubbing and reticence, public persona and intense privacy, counterculture innovation and determined marketing. The everyday object was his icon, the provocative phrase his byword. `` In the future,'' said <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s famous assertion in a 1968 exhibition catalog, `` everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.'' `` He was an incredible character,'' said <PERSON> Bourdon </PERSON>. `` There are just so many conflicting stories and irreconcilable anecdotes; I do n't think it can ever be sorted out. I think he's just going to evaporate into legend. He wanted it that way. Facts were always a little unglamorous to him.'' But in the absence of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s own brand of glamor _ his ethereal, black-draped, white-wigged presence _ what remains is the reality of his art. `` You take a look at the work and the personality becomes less of an issue,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>. `` The social presence that he projected is no longer part of the evaluation, and one can look at the work more clearly.'' That appraisal is going on intensively, as often happens after the death of an artist. The Whitney plans a spring retrospective of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> films. The Museum of Modern Art is preparing for a major show of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> art next year; it will tour worldwide. At least four books on his life are due out soon. `` He tried to cultivate a two-dimensional persona. Now, when one begins to see the depth of who he was, it becomes more intriguing,'' said <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>. `` He is far more significant than he allowed his public to believe.'' There are some signs already of the increased value of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s work At auction in October, a <LOCATION> Warhol </LOCATION> painting that was expected to sell for $ 70,000 went for $ 220,000; another with an estimate of $ 50,000 sold for $ 176,000. Those sums pale in comparison to the potential value of an agreement between <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s estate and <ORGANIZATION> Schlaifer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the marketing firm behind the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, who often blurred the line between fine and commercial art, had started the discussions with <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> two years ago. The company may put his name and images on bedding, cosmetics, paper goods, jewelry _ a huge range of retail items whose sales it has said could reach the billion-dollar level. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> may have approved; `` Being good in business,'' he wrote in 1975, `` is the most fascinating kind of art.'' But for all the marketing schemes and planned art shows, <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s legacy may make its brashest statement in April and May, when <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house sells the entire, eclectic assortment of artworks and knickknacks that cluttered his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> townhouse. Proceeds will fund a foundation for the visual arts. The sale is classic Warhol: The six-volume catalog, selling for $ 95, is <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s costliest ever, and the first to be sold in advance in bookstores nationwide. The pieces include 134 pottery cookie jars, a Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>, a few important modern art works. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s forecasts a $ 10 million to $ 15 million sale; other estimates are more than twice that. The crowd of bidders is sure to glitter. The artist, his friends say, would have loved the fuss _ but in his own, unrevealing way. `` There's been a much heightened interest, naturally,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, his longtime manager and now executor of his estate. `` <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> was a hard guy to figure out his reaction. But I think he would have taken it in his stride.''

 Rescue workers recovered eight victims and rescued 13 people late Sunday beneath a massive mudslide in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, which has been hit by three days of pounding rains. At least 74 people died and 11,000 were left homeless by the violent storms since Friday, which turned streets into raging torrents, threw cars like toys and carried ramshackle homes roaring down hillsides, civil defense officials said early Monday. Authorities estimated 50,000 people eventually may have to be relocated. Throughout the city, army trucks and volunteers helped transport slum dwellers from precarious hillside homes to temporary shelters in schools, churches and public buildings. In some cases, people refused to leave their partially destroyed homes, preferring to ris being crushed beneath their homes than leave their worldly possession Health officials promised mass vaccinations against tetanus and typhoid and warned residents against an outbreak of leprosy, which followed a similar spate of rainstorms earlier this month. `` From above, one has the impression a giant stepped through the city, smashing homes and hillsides,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Saturnino </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON>, who called the three-day onslaught the city's worst disaster. Civil defense officials estimated Saturday that as many as 150 people were killed in the rains that began late Friday, but the figure on Sunday lowered to 48 and later raised back to 74. Twenty more people were believed missing beneath mud and debris, including at least eight more people at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Genoveva </LOCATION> hospital. Rescuers recovered the eight bodies and 13 people alive from the nursing home in the upscale hillside neighborhood of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teresa </LOCATION>, where a three-story wing of the hospital was crushed by a mudslide Saturday. `` It's hard to have an accurate view of the number of dead,'' said civil defense spokesman <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>. `` We have no idea how many people have been burried by their shanty town homes nor do we know exactly how many were in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Genoveva </LOCATION> hospital at the time it was stuck, though we imagine some 30 of the 350 patients died.'' Torrents raged down streets throughout the city, prompting some people to tie their cars to posts to prevent them from being swept away. Civil defense workers used amphibious vehicle and surfboards to pluck people from partially submerged cars. Rivers and drainage canals overflowed, pushing dozens of shanty homes from their precarious hillside perches. Much of the damage was inflicted on the slums that hold about 2 million of the city's 7 million residents, but wealthy areas also suffered heavy damage. In the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teresa </LOCATION> district, an eight-floor apartment building was evacuated and threatened to topple, engineers said. Evacuations were ordered after flooding hit the wealthy <LOCATION> Gavea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lagoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jardim </PERSON> <PERSON> Botanico </PERSON> districts. Vice Mayor <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezende </PERSON> said he has asked the federal government for $ 4 million to clean up city streets, relocate slum dwellers and repair embankments and streets washed away by the waters. `` I ca n't even imagine what will happen to this city if the rains continue,'' <PERSON> Rezende </PERSON> told the Jornal do Brasil radio. `` The situation is desperate. We estimate 50,000 people will have to be given new housing in safer areas.'' Public schools were used as shelter for the estimated 10,000 homeless, <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said. Supermarkets were asked to donate food and doctors were asked to report for duty. Globo, the country's biggest private television network, carried news flashes every 15 minutes to solicit donations of time, food and medication. Meteorologists said the downpour was caused by an <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> cold front that likely was to continue through Monday. Health Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Noronha </PERSON> told <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> residents to boil their drinking water and said the government would carry out vaccinations against typhoid and tetanus. He said 69 people had been hospitalized since the beginning of the month with leprosy, a disease carried by rats and contaminated water. Five have died of the disease, <PERSON> Noronha </PERSON> said on Jornal do Brasil radio. Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslides around the state and 13,000 were left homless. The worst-hit area was <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION>, a mountain resort town 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>.

 Investigators in motorboats raked the bottom of a shallow pond at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sunday, pulling up debris that may be a clue to a commuter plane crash that killed 12 people. No one survived Friday night's crash of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> Flight 3378, which went down shortly after takeoff en route to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Because of debris found in the water, investigators believe the twin-engine turboprop hit the pond before plunging into a wooded area and exploding, officials said Sunday evening Earlier, they had said the plane had barely skimmed the pond, a flood reservoir, before crashing. Parts of the plane, including a portion of the hydraulic system, were found within 40 feet of the bank, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>. He also said that investigators believe the 28-year-old first officer, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>, was flying the plane when it crashed Friday, because the captain, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, was talking to the control tower when the plane took off. `` The person that does the flying does n't usually do the radio,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>, who was hired by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> last May, had 2,150 total flying hours and 450 in the Metro-III, the craft type involved in the crash. `` She was qualified,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. `` There is no doubt about that.'' Weather at the time of the accident, although poor, was not so severe as to endanger the flight. Visibility on the runway was between 2,400 and 3,000 feet when the crash occurred. The flight could have taken off down to 1,600 feet, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>, said officials hoped that the search of the reservoir would show `` how -LRB- the plane -RRB- broke up. It helps determine the sequence of events.'' About 25 investigators, including some from the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, sifted through the roped-off wreckage site on the pond's bank, peering at small bits of debris and examining larger plane parts for signs of malfunction. Beyond them, men in lifejackets piloted two motorboats around the surface of the pond, using poles and hooks to retrieve small pieces of crash debris. The pond measured about 4 feet deep and 75 yards wide, officials said. The debris will be used to determine the state and angle of the plane when it struck the bank, since the aircraft carried no flight data or cockpit voice recorders, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. Neither is currently required by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on commuter aircraft, although they will be as of March 1989, he said. `` If it was flying upside-down, that tells you something,'' he said. Some trees were broken and others were skinned as much as 200 yards beyond the water when the aircraft hit the wooded bank. The wreckage, including the entire silver tail, was strewn over an area measuring about 50 feet by 150 feet, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. Rubble and bits of shiny metal still littered the tall grass. The largest plane piece, a red -, white - and blue-striped shard from the fuselage measuring about 15 feet, lay amid several broken pine tree Wheels from the landing gear had broken off their axle, while about 30 yards away, a piece of the aircraft's emergency door lay twisted in the mud The remains of the 10 passengers and two crew members were removed Saturday night from the crash site and taken to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> medical examiner's laboratory in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Damiano </PERSON>, an airport spokeswoman. Officials were using fingerprints to help identify the victims, she said.

<TEXT>
 For more than 20 years, the lights of this western <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> community have shimmered with national pride. As the lights of <PERSON> LaVale </PERSON> flicker at dusk, a near-perfect outline of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> begins to shine brightly from this residential community nestled in the foothills of the <ORGANIZATION> Alleghenies </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an unusual happenstance. No one tried to make it,'' said <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON>, who has lived for 25 years atop <LOCATION> Haystack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> where the map is best viewed on a cold, clear winter night. `` I'm not sure who discovered it My wife mentioned it to me. She could n't believe it.'' A shopping center forms the U.S.-Canadian border. A well-lighted thoroughfare around <PERSON> LaVale </PERSON> is the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is about a mile of motels, fast food restaurants and stores along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 40. `` It's beginning to get a litle busy and distorted because of all the development in the LaVale area,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who also lives in the 124-home Sunset View development on the mountain. `` As you come down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is starting to get a little out of proportion.'' `` Back five, 10 years ago, it was probably a little better,'' she said. `` We're not knocking the development, but we're losing our <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> is formed where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 48 disappears behind a mountain ridge. The southern edge of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> is a bowling alley. A disfigured <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> appears where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 40 vanishes around <LOCATION> Haystack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. And the Gulf Coast is a grouping of homes and other establishments. `` It's the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, a planner with the <ORGANIZATION> Allegany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` I guess just about everyone has heard of it. I do n't know if everyone believes it.'' The residential community of more than 7,200 has experienced a rush of commercial and residential development, especially since the 1960s, <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said. `` We were worried about the mall when it opened up -LRB- in 1981 -RRB-, but it's actually a big <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruddell </PERSON>, a businessman who lives in the area. `` There's no <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. We have to do some more development.'' <PERSON> Ruddell </PERSON>, past chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the map is best seen in the winter when leaves have fallen from trees on Haystack Mountain. About nine months ago, members of the association thought about topping some trees to provide a better view, but scrapped the idea in favor of more pressing needs, he said. Some residents expressed concern that publicity would attract sightseers to Sunset View and create traffic, but others said most local residents either have already seen it, or have no interest in getting a glimpse of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in lights. `` Sometimes at night people stop out in front and you wonder what they're doing,'' <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON> said. `` But then you know what they're doing They're looking at the map.'' `` I remember one time _ it's been years ago _ one of my neighbors called and said, ` There's someone down in your garden with a tripod surveying,''' <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON> said. `` They were n't surveying. They were down there taking pictures of the map.''

<HEAD>Half Of Crisis Hotline Staff Walks Out in Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 30 years of handling people in crisis, the <ORGANIZATION> Suicide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has a crisis of its own. Half the telephone hotline workers have walked out in a dispute over layoffs and control of the center. The workers went out on Jan. 1 and it has been a sometimes noisy dispute, with striking counselors picketing the center's offices and chanting `` down with the board'' during a recent closed-door meeting of directors. Despite the walkout, the crisis line handled more calls in January than it did the same month a year earlier, Executive Director <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Halfon </PERSON> said. In fact, the strike has prompted people to come forward to ask if the center needed their help. `` We were deluged with calls from people who read about it and -LRB- asked -RRB- how could they volunteer,'' <PERSON> Halfon </PERSON> said. In addition to the crisis line, the center operates a substance abuse clinic, a halfway house, an AIDS research project, an art therapy program and an annual curriculum for schools on substance abuse and suicide. Before the layoffs, the center _ excluding crisis line workers _ had about 90 full - and part-time employees The crisis line was staffed by about 80 volunteers and consultants. The latter are workers who started out as volunteers but have begun to receive part-time, $ 6-an-hour shifts. The crisis line workers walked out when 27 of the non-crisis line staffers were laid off and the hours of 15 others were cut back late last year. The layoff was strictly a `` budgetary concern,'' <PERSON> Halfon </PERSON> asserted, though she admitted, `` the timing was terrible, you know, December.'' The center's budget in 1985-86 was about $ 3 million, including revenue from contracts, grants, clinic fees and donations, she said. But in the last year, some grants have ended and contracts that provided government funding have not been renewed, she said, estimating the current budget at about $ 1.5 million. `` We are concerned with fulfilling that,'' she said. `` The cutbacks in just the layoffs will result in a savings of half a million dollars.'' The strikers, however, are particularly upset that among those laid off was the center's first employee, social worker <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilig </PERSON>, who served as a clinical consultant. `` We ca n't function without a clinical person in control,'' <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisler </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the strikers, said recently. `` The dismissal of one of the most well known and most experienced persons in the area of suicide prevention does n't make much sense,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farberow </PERSON>, a psychologist who co-founded the center in 1958. <PERSON> Heilig </PERSON> did not return a telephone call for comment. In 1984, <PERSON> Farberow </PERSON> and the other founder, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>, turned the center over to a board of directors composed of local business people so that they could focus on research. But the founders, who have remained as clinicians, want to regain control of the center. The board of directors met Feb. 7 to deal with the center's problems <PERSON> Halfon </PERSON> said the directors favored putting a member of the crisis line staff on the board, but she would not reveal what moves the board would take to resolve the overall problem of `` ultimate administrative control'' of the organization. `` That's the part that's in question. What's the best way to preserve the integrity and assets of the organization?''

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five months after the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> fired him, former agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is grappling with a religious renewal that caused him to question his past, challenge his supervisors and lose his job. Wholesale changes are taking place in the life of a man who was 10 months away from settling into a quiet retirement when he was dismissed Sept. 11. After carrying a gun every day during 21 years of loyal <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> service, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> now is a pacifist who denounces the `` immoral activities'' of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' involvement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 49, is selling his <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> home, where he and his wife, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>, raised four children. And he's pondering a total change in lifestyle while searching for a way to support his family the next 12 years until he can collect his federal pension. `` It would be inconsistent for me to continue being a heavy consumer knowing how many victims the American lifestyle demands,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said recently. `` There's war in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> so we can continue to eat Big Macs, and I do n't want to contribute to that. We're scaling down our lifestyle to a more simplified life.'' His only income comes from speaking engagements and from teaching a sociology class at <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Legal fees to fight his dismissal have eaten $ 13,000 out of the family savings _ perhaps part of the reason for the change in lifestyle. Clad in sneakers and jeans, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> hardly resembled the man who spent two decades in foreign counterintelligence, investigating organized crime in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and hunting fugitives like anti-war activist <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>. His work twice won him commendations, but something was missing from his life. A devout Roman Catholic who once studied for the priesthood, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> started taking religious study courses about 10 years ago. He earned his master's degree in 1985, and the transformation from a follower of <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> into a pacifist began to mature. It was then that <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> knew his beliefs would conflict with his role as chief counterintelligence operative in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s five-man office here. But he never really thought it would lead to his dismissal. `` Refusing an order was something I'd never done before, and I knew an act of insubordination would cost me some sort of disciplinary action,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` I have religious beliefs they are bound to accommodate. There are office jobs, places I could work in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. I would n't have to carry a gun. `` I think they overreacted in firing me. It was stupid. Look at all the notoriety it has caused.'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s life is in turmoil, but he seems content with his decision to refuse an order to investigate an anti-nuclear group suspected of vandalizing 11 Chicago-area military recruiting offices. `` I really feel I did the right thing,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if I could have lived with myself had I done anything differently. His firing occurred 10 months before his 50th birthday in June, when he would have been eligible for full retirement with 20 years service. `` I could have simply ignored the order, but I chose not to. I felt what we were doing was clearly investigating peace groups with the obvious intention of intimidating and harassing them. I thought the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was ill-advised to do this and I told them.'' Despite his change of heart, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> negotiated with <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and offered to reinstate him, with back pay, in December on the condition he never speak of the case again. He said he signed an agreement and mailed it to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters but for some reason the deal collapsed. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has refused to say why. This month, an administrative judge in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> ruled the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was justified in firing <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. At a hearing, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he could not take a human life, even if his or another person's life was endangered. He believes that was a key reason his dismissal was upheld. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> still hopes to reclaim his job and his pension, and an appeal is planned.

<TEXT>
 The mother of a man accused of bursting into a defense company and shooting seven people to death said she's saddened by the `` waste of life'' and wants to send sympathy cards to the victims' families. `` I wish those people would know how badly we feel,'' <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said in an interview published Sunday. `` I do n't know if it would help -LRB- to send cards -RRB-, but we could tell them how sad we are about all of this.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 70, also said she was shocked to learn that her son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, was charged with seven counts of murder in Tuesday's shootings at <ORGANIZATION> ESL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offices in nearby <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>. `` We'd never had any problems with <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview Saturday from her home in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, about 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who is retired from a career in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, learned of the shootings and their oldest child's arrest the next day after they tried to contact him in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s parents nor any of his five brothers and sisters have heard from him since the attack, she said. `` We do n't communicate much,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who has n't seen her son since a trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> 1 -LCB- years ago. She also said her son never mentioned 26-year-old <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, an ESL employee who authorities describe as the unwilling object of <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s romantic fantasies. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s four-year obsession with the electrical engineer is believed by authorities to be the reason for the rampage. He was fired in May 1986 for harassing <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who went to court for a restraining order to stop him from following, calling and writing her, authorities said. Black was one of the three people who were shot during the rampage, but she survived. She remained in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she is expected to remain for several more days. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> remained under 24-hour surveillance at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> said he was quiet and polite. Besides the seven murder counts, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> is charged with three counts of attempted murder. He could face execution if convicted.

 A fire roared through a crowded house early Sunday, killing two children and three mentally retarded adults and injuring four other people, authorities said. The fire apparently started near a wood stove and the rural, two-story house was in flames by the time firefighters arrived, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> investigator W.H. <PERSON> Gholson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Phenix </LOCATION> firefighters were aided by neighboring departments from <LOCATION> Redhouse </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Brookneal </PERSON>, but the blaze destroyed the house. There were 11 people in the house at the time the fire broke out, officials said. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlett </PERSON>, one of the two who escaped unhurt, identified the victims as <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schofield </PERSON>, 49; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 21; <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, 64; <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 3; and <PERSON> Rashanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, 18 months. `` We tried to get the people out of there for 20 or 30 minutes,'' said Chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Phenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Then the fire and the heat got to be too much, and I had to pull everybody back.'' <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, 84, was listed in critical condition Sunday night at <ORGANIZATION> Lynchburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with burn injuries. Three other occupants were treated and released, <PERSON> Gholson </PERSON> said. The home was owned by <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, who was among those who escaped with minor injuries, <PERSON> Gholson </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said the three adults were mentally retarded wards of the state and she was paid by <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to take care of them. She said they had lived in her home for as much as 16 years and were relatively self-sufficient. <PERSON> Leddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, director of county social services, could not be reached for comment early Monday; telephone calls to her home went unanswered. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the fire apparently started after Ms. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> added wood to the stove and returned to bed. `` We do n't know if it was a defective flue or if there was combustible material near the stove right now. We think it probably came from a spark that flew out.'' Ms. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> discovered the fire when she went downstairs to warm up, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` She got burned by the fire, and that's when <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> and -LRB- resident -RRB- <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlett </PERSON> came in and tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher. Then they started with buckets of water, but they could n't do anything to it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlett </PERSON> went to a neighbor's house, where they called the fire department. They were both treated and released. Officials said <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlett </PERSON> was Ms. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s daughter, and some of the other people in the house were related, but they were n't sure of their exact relationship. They said the only retarded adults who were wards of the state were apparently the three adults who died. Four bodies were recovered, but the body of the younger child, who had been sleeping on the second floor, had not been found, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars since 1985 hiring American lobbyists to champion the country's cause in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and improve its image in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, records show. Among those who have registered as agents of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a long-time political adviser to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>; M.B. <PERSON> Oglesby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> assistant for legislative affairs; <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, an executive with ties to Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s network, and <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the son of Rep. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss The documents are filed at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires foreign agents to report their activities every six months. Many foreign governments hire lobbyists to help learn about the complicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bureaucracy. In recent years, the practice has attracted congressional scrutiny, particularly when former government officials sell their inside knowledge to foreigners. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malo </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s embassy, said the government no longer employs any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lobbyists, and the records indicate that many contracts have lapsed. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated sharply since Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the country's dominant figure, was indicted on drug smuggling charges in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> this month. One of the most recent filings _ covering the period through December 1987 _ was made by <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and one-time business partner of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an associate of North's. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was paid nearly $ 145,000 between July and December 1987 by a Panamanian business group set up in August 1986 to `` promote tourism, exports, investment and an improved image'' for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The group, <ORGANIZATION> Impulso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turistico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, is headed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> is a businessman with `` ties to people in the government.'' Panamanian opposition figures, including <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON>, the editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> is close to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON> lives in exile in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. For his money, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> worked extensively with the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the documents show. Among his duties: `` Edited articles written by embassy officials,'' and, `` Made copies of newspaper articles, speeches and letters as requested by the embassy.'' The $ 21,000 a month contract with <PERSON> Impulso </PERSON> was first signed in September 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, a now-defunct firm run by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> North </PERSON> raising money for the Nicaraguan Contras in 1985 and 1986, has pleaded guilty to tax violations in soliciting contributions for the rebels. There is no indication that <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> worked with <PERSON> North </PERSON>. North, an ex-National <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, was fired in November 1986 for his role in using money secured through the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to help the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said his relationship with the Panamanian group has ended, and he no longer works with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Some major firms, such as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which employed <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oglesby </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edelman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, lost their contracts with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1986, a year in which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> came under increasing attack from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials.

 A wildfire whipped by winds of up to 50 mph raced through a mountain valley south of here Sunday, destroying at least three homes and burning hundreds of acres of grassland, witnesses said. No injuries were reported. Firefighters from at least 10 volunteer fire departments in the rural area northwest of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> battled the blaze, assisted by volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lands </ORGANIZATION> and two mining companies. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Giono </PERSON>, a dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the fire was first reported in early afternoon and had grown to 500 acres by early evening It remained uncontrolled, and those on the scene reported at least three homes destroyed, she said. The fire was centered about five miles south of this town of 1,000 and was headed eastward, not toward the town, officials said. The homes that burned were scattered rural residences. The wind `` is as bad as I've ever seen it,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a trapper who lives on the south edge of town. `` The ... stuff was going faster than you could run.'' `` A lot of people lost their homes,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said, but noted he did not know exactly how many homes were destroyed. Authorities said it was believed that the fire was caused by a downed power line, but that had not been confirmed. Strong winds raked much of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> east of the Continental Divide on Sunday. There were widespread reports of damaged roofs, downed power lines, uprooted trees and toppled billboards and signs.

<HEAD>Six Meteorites From Moon Found in Antarctica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 15-year search for meteorites in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> has turned up thousands of meteorites, including six from the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and one possible rock from Mars, scientists say. Those seven meteorites _ solid bodies that travel through space and survive passage through the Earth's atmosphere _ have been the focus of years of scrutiny by scientists looking for insight on the composition of the two heavenly bodies. `` It has always been assumed that a lot of material should be falling off the moon from meteoritic impact,'' said <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, a geologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Astrophysics here. `` We suspected that some of our meteorites came from the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> before the Apollo missions.'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> was part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expedition that discovered the plum-sized rock weighing about four grams in January 1982. Japanese scientists have located five lunar meteorites in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. Scientists also are `` building a case'' for Martian origin of the meteorite found in 1979. Comparing the 1982 find with lunar samples collected by American astronauts, scientists found the meteorite closely matched highland materials returned by the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 crews. Analysis indicated that the fragment was blasted away from the moon by an asteroid impact about 100,000 years ago and hurled to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The 66-year-old <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, who also teaches part-time at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the lunar meteorite probably was traveling in space for between 1,900 and 2,500 years before crashing through the atmosphere and landing on the Antarctic ice. The Antarctic rock believed to be from Mars spent about 10 million years in space. Some of the 1,000 moon rocks retrieved in the Apollo missions have been dated at more than 4 billion years old _ a short time, by geologic standards. X-rays and gamma-rays of the moon's surface taken by Apollo orbiters have led scientists to believe the lunar meteorite may come from a crater on the far-eastern rim of the moon or on the unexplored dark side, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> said. `` We went to six places on the moon and the Russians sent unmanned landers to three places,'' she said. `` We have no exact location for this composition anywhere.'' Annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meteorite expeditions to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> occur in the six weeks of the year when the continent is bathed in sunlight 24 hours a day. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Smithsonian </LOCATION> provide equipment and financing for research for the meteoritic expeditions, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, who has has made three trips to the 5-million-square-mile continent to search for meteorites. She said that since manned moon exploration stopped after the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, meteorite searches are crucial. `` It's one of the most vital and productive aspects of the space program,'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> said. `` As a matter of fact, in planetary exploration it's the only show in town. This all gives us more information _ without actually going up there _ about the evolution of the moon as a body.''

<HEAD>Pesticide Issue Flares Amid Growing Concern over Health Effects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A foul-smelling mist came rolling into <LOCATION> Atwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on the night air, silently blanketing a row of homes on the outskirts. Within an hour, townsfolk were staggering into the emergency room. Environmentalists point to the June 1 incident, which they contend was caused by pesticides sprayed on nearby peach orchards, to fuel their arguments that the nation must do more to control the poisons. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is set to try once again to overhaul the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act -LRB- <LOCATION> FIFRA </LOCATION> -RRB-, the primary law providing for regulation of the compounds. Pesticides are now a $ 5 billion-a-year industry. Tomatoes, beef, potatoes, apples, pork and many other foods arrive at the dinner table laden with chemicals. In a number of states, pesticides have been found in groundwater, often used for drinking. Chemical makers contend that the benefits of pesticides outweigh the risks. They say drinking a glass of well water where contamination has been measured poses less hazard than downing a shot of vodka. However, there are some 113,000 cases of pesticide-related illness and injury logged each year. A May 1987 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> report said cancer is caused in laboratory animals by 30 percent of the insecticides most likely to show up in food, 50 percent of the herbicides and 90 percent of the fungicides. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has moved fitfully at best to tighten regulation of the 1 billion pounds of pesticides sprayed on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fields annually in the war on bacteria, fungi, bugs, worms, mice and other forms of crop blight. Critics ridicule <LOCATION> FIFRA </LOCATION> as hopelessly toothless. `` We call it a no-law law because it does n't do anything,'' consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> says. A 1972 rewrite of <LOCATION> FIFRA </LOCATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> until 1975 to complete a `` reregistration'' process, including a full-scale safety review, of some 700 pesticides. In 1975, lawmakers approved a one-year extension. In 1978, the deadline was junked altogether. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, now estimates that at the present crawl, the job wo n't be completed until the year 2024. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., and Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., have proposed a nine-year deadline for the reregistration process, plus a possible two-year `` I think most Americans are willing to put up with a spot on their lettuce or a blemish on their apple rather than risk cancer,'' says <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, champion of the nation's pesticide makers, has no objection to a speedup in itself. More complex issues, however, are lying in the legislative weeds and could rise up to scuttle the bill. Something similar happened in 1986 when a seeming compromise came unglued just before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned. Chemical companies are willing to contribute to the costs of reregistration by paying $ 150,000 per ingredient. But the Leahy-Lugar bill calls for $ 750,000, which the <ORGANIZATION> NACA </ORGANIZATION> calls `` a money grab, pure and simple.'' Under current law, companies are entitled to indemnities from <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to compensate for the banning of their products. Already the agency has paid $ 2.4 million to chemical makers for taking the pesticide EDB off the market and $ 18 million for a chemical known as 2,4,5-T, or Silex. And the agency estimates it will pay out between $ 60 million and $ 155 million in indemnities and disposal costs to get rid of a pesticide called Dinoseb, The annual budget of the entire <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> pesticide program is $ 70 million. The Leahy-Lugar bill would bar such indemnities unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed an individual money bill for each one. Such a measure is guaranteed a rough time on Capitol Hill. The industry is firmly opposed. Manufacturers have other objections as well, especially to an amendment <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> co-sponsored with Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn. <ORGANIZATION> NACA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the Leahy-Durenberger amendment contains `` an unrealistic ground water definition, unenforceable goals for water quality standards and -LRB- an -RRB- unworkable state ground and surface water protection program. Of the main legislation, he said the plan to require separate money bills for indemnities would `` ultimately be bad for agriculture'' because `` there is no guarantee that agricultural users will recoup their losses.'' However, one incentive to action is a provision that would extend patent rights for chemical manufacturers. The 1986 bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also included provisions that would preempt states from setting more stringent safety standards than those of the federal government and exempt agricultural producers from cleanup liability under the environmental laws. They were rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> when it fashioned its own version. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Agriculture and the Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> committees are fighting over jurisdiction of the bill. Some <LOCATION> FIFRA </LOCATION> critics, such as <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hind </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, declare in disgust that it `` will take a disaster'' to get the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moving on pesticide legislation. But <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, scoffs at that notion. `` We do n't need a disaster,'' he says. `` We know what we have to do.''

 Eleven cars of a 133-car <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> freight train derailed and spilled an acid solution into a creek, threatening the water supply for thousands of people, authorities said. No one was injured in Sunday's derailment in which one car spilled about 13,000 gallons of phosphatic fertilizer solution containing phosphoric acid into the creek leading to the <LOCATION> Lamine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fussner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <LOCATION> Lamine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which feeds into the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, is the water source for nearby <LOCATION> Boonville </LOCATION>, a town of nearly 7,000 residents. Officials shut off the water intake valve to the community as a precaution, and residents were asked to conserve water, said Lt. <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Loesing </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> office. The <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> water department was monitoring its water supply from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Phosphoric acid can irritate the skin and respiratory system, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>, environmental emergency specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. A 50-man cleanup crew worked into the night with backhoes and bulldozers to clean up and neutralize the acid. Trace elements of the acid were found in the <LOCATION> Lamine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but no fish were killed, <PERSON> Fussner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fussner </PERSON> said the cause of the accident, which occurred shortly before noon two miles from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, was under investigation. Union Pacific officials called a cleanup contractor, who built a dam to try to prevent the fertilizer from further contaminating the <LOCATION> Lamine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Lime was hauled in to neutralize the acid, <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fussner </PERSON> said the railroad encountered problems because the spill was in a remote area. No roads lead to the area, and all supplies were being brought in by train. The train was traveling from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, when the accident occurred near this central Missouri town.

<HEAD>Chirac Pulling Ahead In Crucial Race For Second Place</HEAD>

<DATELINE>REIMS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, long mired in third place in opinion polls, has seen his presidential campaign take off, giving him an edge over rival conservative <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> with two months left before the vote. The first round of the election, April 24, has become in effect a primary election between <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>. Unless there is a stunning turnaround, one of the two will oppose a Socialist, probably incumbent President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, in the decisive May 8 runoff for a seven-year term. Policy differences between <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> are few and minor, so the campaign has focused on the contrasting personalities of the two men, and what their political advisers increasingly call `` le look.'' There is certainly no need for the voters to discover the candidates _ <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has been a major national figure for 40 years, <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> for 15 years each. `` It's a question of sentiment, who looks better and talks better,'' said <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Louapre </PERSON>, a Barre supporter interviewed on the edges of a cocktail reception during a <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> campaign swing Wednesday through <LOCATION> Reims </LOCATION>, capital of the Champagne country northeast of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` Personally, I've chosen <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Louapre </PERSON>, a construction engineer. `` Mr. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has certainly taken off faster. He has much stronger support from his party.'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, a rangy, almost hyperactive figure, then displayed his formidable skills as a campaigner, moving swiftly through the crowd, but often stopping to grasp the hands of his supporters briefly in his own oversized hands. `` I think the premier is closer to people, and that's what will make him win,'' political science professor <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Redslob </PERSON>, author of a book on <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` I think there's a strong movement beginning to lift off.'' `` The Barre style is that of a fairly cold man, who has wanted to give himself an image of rigor,'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s minister of overseas territories, recently said in a radio interview `` He is a man who is fairly secret and who ... frequently makes decisions alone.'' <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, a rotund economics professor who had never run for public office when he began his five-year term as premier in 1976, is widely respected but inspires little enthusiasm. He prides himself on telling people what they need to know, whether or not they want to hear it. `` They tell me to offer the French people a dream,'' <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> told a campaign rally in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` But to dream, one must first go to sleep. I love my country too much, I respect my fellow citizens too much to lend myself to that.'' <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> says <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s government, which took over from the Socialists in March 1986, has made some good moves. He says he would take stronger action to boost French industry. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has long had a solid lead in all published opinion surveys, while <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> trailed <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> thoughout last year. A poll published Jan. 16, the day <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> declared his candidacy, gave <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> 41 percent to 25 percent for <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> and 18.5 percent for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. But surveys published in the past two weeks have shown <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> pushing ahead. Friday's edition of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Paris-Match </ORGANIZATION>, for exampale, reported 23 percent of those questioned planning to vote for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, to 19 percent for <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who says he will wait until mid-March to disclose his plans, remained far ahead with 36 percent. The questions were posed for Paris-Match and a radio network by the polling firm B.V.A., which between Feb. 1-4 interviewed 1,316 people who said they intended to vote. No margin of error was disclosed. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, who insists on his independence from all political parties, is supported by the Union for <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a loose grouping of five center-right parties that is part of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s governing coalition The main event of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s five-hour visit to <LOCATION> Reims </LOCATION> was a campaign rally that drew 7,000 supporters to a new exposition hall in the suburbs. Many arrived in buses chartered by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s party, the Rally for the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most efficient political machine. Rather than give a speech, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> answered questions from three men and two women chosen to raise issues of concern in the region. He defended <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s agricultural policies and promised to improve schools and universities so that students learn skills they need to find jobs. He also said he hoped to increase family allowances to mothers of three or more children to the minimum wage, about $ 825 a month, `` because they deserve it.'' The first question asked of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who is juggling duties as mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, premier of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and member of a regional council in south-central <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, was how he can do all the work. `` I'm an optimist by nature,'' he replied, `` which probably gives me more energy to face problems.''

 Young cancer victims and their parents gained emotional support and more than $ 300,000 in financial help from college students who swayed and staggered through a 48-hour dance marathon. `` I just like the fact that people are dancing not just to dance for fun but to help kids,'' said 10-year-old <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON> of Etters, a leukemia patient who took a few turns around the dance floor with <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students Sunday. Billed as the largest student-run fund-raising event in the country, the 16th annual Interfraternity Dance Marathon raised $ 324,200 in pledges for the Four Diamonds Fund at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, organizers said Sunday <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, said she and her husband, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, would have been forced to sell their house without financial help from the fund, which helps pay for treatment of children suffering from cancer. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherfy </PERSON>, a social worker at <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> who works with the young cancer victims, said the dance marathon offered the parents and children more than money. `` They know there's someone out in the world who cares about them,'' <PERSON> Sherfy </PERSON> said. Near then end of the marathon, participants complained of sore feet, fatigue and boredom. `` It's torture,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>, a junior management major from <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cove </PERSON>, N.Y. But <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> and many other dancers said they gained resolve from the children at the dance. `` When they brought the kids in Saturday, you said to yourself, ` You can do it,''' said <PERSON> Tammie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>, a sophomore business management major from <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y. Hundreds of volunteers, clad in yellow T-shirts, attended the hobbled and weary dancers as they endured the final leg of the marathon. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a sophomore sports medicine major from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, taped feet, iced ankles and treated blisters from a trainer's table off the dance floor. `` Some people come in and their feet are just flat,'' said West, explaining that fallen arches were the most frequent physical malady. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmach </PERSON>, a junior marketing major from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said she and other dancers had a tactic for keeping their minds off their feet. `` You have to do something that makes you think of your hands,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stelmach </PERSON> said. She said she had played catch using a frisbee and balls and even participated in a card game. A total of 272 couples _ 544 dancers _ entered the marathon this year, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON>, a senior accounting major from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and head of the organizing committee. A total of 506 finished. They were allowed only three-minute breaks every eight hours and three other three-minute breaks at some time during the marathon. Spectators filled the White Building Gymnasium to capacity for the final hours of the marathon, clapping and cheering. <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said this year's marathon was the most financially successful in the event's history. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON>, director of development for the medical center, said the marathon is the single biggest source of income for the Four Diamonds Fund. Last year, the dance marathon raised $ 297,000, <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who has made `` It's your fight too'' his populist rally cry, has chosen this state as a staging ground for a bid to block <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from sweeping the handful of states holding presidential primaries or caucuses before Super Tuesday. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and to a lesser extent <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, are the states chosen by the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign for an intensive effort even as the three-week campaign for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and its rich pool of delegates has already begun. According to the calendar and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination rules, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> might not appear a major battleground. Its primary was set for Tuesday, earlier than national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> officials wanted it, only after agreement was reached that means the state's nominating delegates wo n't be selected until later and wo n't be bound by the primary outcome. But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has attached far more significance to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, boarding a jet to fly here just as the sun was starting to rise Wednesday morning on his badly needed second-place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` You have a powerful voice in the election in 1988,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> told a group of senior citizens in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, on the opposite end of the state. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, his campaign on the ropes after finishing behind the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, has chosen <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to make what could be his last stand. He said at one point that if he did n't win in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, or in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s caucuses which also are held Tuesday, he will drop out of the race, but then backed off on that assertion, citing a surge of donations. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> strategists, however, say it is not <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that they regard as their bigger concern in those two states, coming as he does off a big victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s primary last Tuesday. That is in part because <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would like to have a primary victory before heading into the 20-state contests on March 8. Perhaps more importantly, however, his campaign would like to block <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from gaining the state and going into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> with one or even more victories under his belt from outside his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. They do not want <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to have the suggestion of inevitibility riding on his side should <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> _ or one of the other candidates _ fail to stop him. There are five states holding primaries or caucuses between now and the contests across the South on Super Tuesday. They are sometimes referred to in the jargon of the campaign trail as the `` Lesser Antilles'' or the `` gateway states'' to Super Tuesday. `` A boost from any of these five gateway states would give us a boost to Super Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s press secretary. The contests include <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s caucuses Feb. 26 and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s beauty-contest primary March 1 The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign is conceding the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor of nearby <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> attended a debate in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> last week but is n't otherwise competing in the state, arguing that its caucus system and internal party divisions make it too confusing to spend time competing <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> brought close to 20 paid staffers from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> as soon as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses were finished. They have purchased $ 40,000 in television commercials in the states's two major cities, <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> _ an amount of money small by other states' standards but regarded as large in the state of fewer than three-quarters of a million people. Internal polling conducted by the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign Wednesday night showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leading in the state by a nine-point margin, with no other candidates close. But it also showed the race was largely uniformed in the state, less than a week before the voting. Another candidate, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, has been quietly at work in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> too, even as he concentrates on the states of his native South. He has ads on the air in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and has visited <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> several times. Another reason for concentrating here is that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> forces believe the states should respond nicely to his populist message _ an assertion the nation is in economic decline in part because of unfair trade practices by <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s support for an oil import fee is considered a plus, particularly in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where a large oil industry remains hard-hit by depressed prices. He stressed that at a small rally in <LOCATION> Casper </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, last week, and seemed to strike a chord among the audience. <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, a member of the county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, said she saw <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> speak in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> a week or so earlier but found <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> more appealing. She said she was wavering, and might back <PERSON> Gephart </PERSON> rather than go along with an effort by state party leaders to back an uncommitted slate. `` I was really set on being uncommitted in the caucuses because I thought it was best for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>,'' she said. But, she said: `` I'm impressed.

<HEAD>House To Jettison Gephardt Amendment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House negotiators are making plans to scuttle a trade retaliation plan authored by Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman is vowing to fight for his amendment. Conferees plan to strip the provision from a House-passed trade measure in an effort to save the overall bill, according to congressional leaders. But lawmakers suggest that as a courtesy to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the conferees will wait until after the March 8 Super Tuesday primary elections before formally abandoning the proposal. `` The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> provision will be dropped. We're going to dump it because it's bad policy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the trade subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> hammering out a compromise trade bill The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> plan calls for trade retaliation against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other trading partners that maintain large trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The omnibus trade legislation it is attached to has languished in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since last fall. `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s a nice fellow and he's got a lot of friends here,'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. `` We're kind of proud of him. But we're not going to make his amendment law.'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders said that once Super Tuesday is past, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees will move quickly to get rid of the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> provision _ regardless of how he does in those primary states. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he has no intention of dropping his push for the amendment that bears his name. `` I'm going to fight for my amendment,'' he said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` I think it will make it through the conference'' committee. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman, who has made trade issues a key part of his presidential pitch, was asked if rejection of the amendment would hurt his campaign. `` Let's see what the result is before we jump to conclusions,'' he said. Conference leaders have held off on moving ahead on the measure to await the results of the early presidential contests _ in part because <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s amendment is such a major part of the House bill. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opposes the imposition of retaliatory trade measures by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has said he will veto the trade bill if it contains <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s amendment. Twenty states hold Democratic primary elections on March 8, with 13 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> where trade is a major issue because of import-battered textile and other local industries. However, with recent signs that the nation's stubborn trade deficit is finally easing under the pressure of a weaker dollar, which makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive overseas, political sentiment has been shifting in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> away from tough retaliatory sanctions. Last October's stock market plunge, which underscored the fragility of world financial markets, has also subdued some of the most vocal calls for protectionist measures on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> measure, passed last spring by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is aimed particularly at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It would require mandatory retaliation after a six-month period if those negotiations prove fruitless. Then, a 10 percent a year reduction in the offending nation's trade surplus _ through tariffs or quotas _ would be required. Trade analysts suggest that as long as the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment is a central part of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, action on trade this year is likely to remain paralyzed; and the better <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> does in the primary campaigns, the harder it will be to win agreement on any compromise trade bill. Actually, Democratic leaders have said privately for some time that, at some point, the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment would have to be dropped. However, deciding just how to go about it with the presidential election year in full swing has all but frozen action on the trade measure until now. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> executive council in <LOCATION> Bal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbour </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, last week, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, predicted that the conference panel would agree on `` something in between'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s proposal and the milder <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill calls for formal investigations that could lead to sanctions against nations running large trade surpluses but would not require blanket retaliation.

 A man awakened by three intruders searching his apartment for a stolen jacket fatally shot one of them with a crossbow, authorities said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hucek </PERSON>, 21, was killed after he and his two companions burst into <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>'s apartment early Saturday, according to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s office. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Roehrick </PERSON> were being held without bail after being charged with burglary and second-degree murder under a state law that permits such prosecution for those involved in a felony resulting in death. `` It was pretty traumatic,'' said the 27-year-old <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>, who was shot in the leg. <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hucek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roehrick </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, 25, spotted <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>'s roommate when they were out driving late Friday. The three thought that the roommate, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaillet </PERSON>, had something to do with the theft of an expensive leather jacket that belonged to one of them, <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON> said. Chaillet, 25, joined the three for driving and beer drinking and later took them back to the apartment, where they confronted him with their suspicions and demanded to search the apartment, <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON> said. The search, which turned up no leather jacket, quickly turned into a ransacking, and the noise woke <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON> said. `` He told them to get out,'' <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON> said. When they refused, <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> armed himself with a screwdriver and forced them out. He locked and bolted the door, but the three kicked in the door and pushed their way inside, where <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> had armed himself with a crossbow. He fired once, striking <PERSON> Hucek </PERSON> in the chest and killing him. The violence continued as Chaillet ran to call authorities. The fight between Farmer, <PERSON> Roehrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> moved into the parking lot, where <PERSON> Roehrick </PERSON> pulled a gun from his truck and shot twice, hitting <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> in the leg, <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, a Communist-backed millionaire businessman, was formally proclaimed president today and vowed to be flexible in seeking reunification of this war-divided island. In his first foray into politics, the 56-year-old <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> narrowly defeated veteran conservative leader <PERSON> Glafcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> in Sunday's runoff. It was <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' closest election since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1960. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> is committed to peace talks with the Turkish Cypriots in the northern, Turkish-occupied part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. He told thousands of jubilant and cheering supporters on Sunday night that he would `` launch an unprecedented effort to promote a settlement.'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> has promised to abandon the inflexible approach of President <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, who insisted on the withdrawal of 30,000 Turkish troops and 65,000 mainland settlers from the north as a precondition to resumed peace talks. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> had sought a third five-year term, but was knocked out in the election's first round on Feb. 14. He endorsed neither <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>. In an acceptance speech broadcast by the state radio, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said he also will work for the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and settlers and for the right of the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees to return to their homes in the north. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded the island in 1974 following a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriot extremists favoring union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, president of the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state established in 1983, has offered to meet the new president in preliminary talks to break a 3-year-old deadlock in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, who ran as an independent with the support of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, defeated <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> on Sunday with 51.63 percent of the vote. He won 167,834 votes to 157,228 or 48.37 percent for the 68-year-old <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kyriacos </PERSON> <PERSON> Christofi </PERSON>, chief election official. <PERSON> Christofi </PERSON> formally proclaimed <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> president early today in a speech from the first-story balcony of the eight-story building that houses <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>'s market research company, the largest in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The new president ordered cameramen of the state-run television not to film leftists waving red flags in the crowd of 5,000 supporters gathered to cheer the proclamation. A pre-dawn victory rally in the capital's main square was called off after minor scuffles between <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> supporters and backers of <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> repeatedly appealed for calm during his broadcast speech and in earlier statements, declaring that he saw his election as a victory for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` There is no victor or vanquished. We should all work for the good of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>,'' he said, stressing the need for national unity. Voting was compulsory for all Greek Cypriots over 21. More than 90 percent of the 363,000 registered voters cast valid ballots. Reunification was the main issue of the campaign, with both <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> stressing the urgency of breaking a peace talks deadlock to avoid the risk of international recognition for the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state. The proclamation of a statelet by the 150,000 Turkish Cypriots was branded invalid by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and has only been recognized by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The Turkish Cypriots took no part in the election. The new president will be sworn in next Sunday.

 The union representing 4,500 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> ground employees in 14 cities vowed `` guerrilla warfare'' against the airline after talks in which management is seeking $ 35 million in concessions broke down. The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> reservation clerks and other ground staff represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> continued working Sunday after the union's 12:01 a.m. strike deadline passed. `` We can strike any time we want,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> airline division. `` We're going to pick our strategic time,'' Genoese said. Meantime, he said, Teamsters would attempt to disrupt operations through `` guerrilla warfare,'' starting immediately. `` There's going to be trouble on the job,'' he said. `` They're not going to correct anybody's errors, they're not going to help anybody, they're not going to do anything for anybody. But a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>, called Genoese `` the jerk'' and said his words were `` completely ridiculous.'' `` Whereas the leadership may be at warfare with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the rank and file are completely loyal to the company. It is not in their hearts to turn their backs on their customers,'' <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON> said. And, <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON> added, any workers taking part in that warfare would face `` discipline in the severest form.'' A federal mediator said both sides told him they would act on his request to reevaluate their positions. `` The board will stay in touch with the parties and there will be a resumption of negotiations at an early and appropriate time,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of the federal mediation board. Negotiations began late Saturday at <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>'s request, and continued for six hours past the strike deadline. When talks broke off Sunday morning, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> leaders promised that union members _ reservation clerks, customer service agents and other clerical staff _ would continue to work. The talks resumed in the afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here, but recessed after about a half-hour when the company rejected the mediator's call for arbitration, Genoese said. The dispute involves <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s attempts to cut costs by $ 35 million through concessions by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. The airline has said it needs about $ 540 million in concessions from its unionized employees during the next three years to ensure its survival. Asked about the major points of contention, <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON> said, `` Let's say that the company long ago established a $ 35 million objective of achieving cost reductions. What is negotiable is how we reach the $ 35 million figure.'' The company does not view the amount as negotiable, <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON> said, but the union maintains that it is. The company said it would maintain operations with replacement workers in the event of a strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday not to support a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' strike, and pilots, flight attendants and flight engineers were not expected to honor picket lines. The Teamsters represent workers at airports in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The vast majority of the workers are employed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Peres Worried About Soviet Role In Arranging Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> says he is concerned about the Soviet role in setting up <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks even as the Soviets pledged to be more of a factor in negotiations. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who favors an international conference to quell the violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, voiced doubts about Soviet involvement in arranging such a conference. The deaths of two Arabs Sunday brought the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis since the protests began Dec. 8 to 61, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. `` What role the Russians will play depends on what role the international conference will play,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Sunday in an interview from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` I would never agree that any foreign country, <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> or other country, will make decisions instead of us or will try to force us to make a decision,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` I do n't accept the Russian concept that an international conference should be an authoritative conference. I think it should be an authorizing conference, namely enabling the parties to negotiate among themselves freely.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he understood that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> share this view. The foreign minister said the conference `` should be like somebody that opens the door to a new era, but not somebody who replaces the residents in the house itself.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also acknowledged Sunday that he sent a handwritten note to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in 1985 about a proposed Iraqi pipeline. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prime minister at the time, previously has denied writing to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that he supported the $ 1 billion, 540-mile pipeline project, which was never built. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, prior to meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said that his government wants `` to play a more active role _ also in the negotiations.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who travels to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> later this week, met with Soviet officials to discuss the next superpower summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Iran-Iraq war and the conflict in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has resisted Soviet participation in the search for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement. In addition to not having relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the Soviets generally support Arab positions. The Soviets broke relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after it defeated <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, then a Soviet ally, in the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war. However, a small group of Soviet diplomats was sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year to take care of some consular matters. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> emphasized the urgent need for negotiations. `` I'm convinced that the time has really come _ which should n't be postponed _ to start to negotiate and find a solution which will answer the expressions of the Palestinians on one hand, and the security call of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the other,'' he said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' welcomed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to set up talks on resolving the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> crisis and never was asked about a Soviet role `` I believe it's a very good idea to bring about a beginning of a talking,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. `` After all, the problem that we face can be solved only by political means. By military means, by force, we can bring about tranquility but not a solution. ... `` We have a very great respect and trust to Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. We believe that he is honest, decent human being and is trying his best to bring about a beginning of a talk.'' Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, who appeared on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program, said negotiations should be conducted under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auspices and not Soviet authority. `` I have the gravest doubts about an international conference,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. `` I have grave doubts about a Soviet role, unless the Soviets are willing to ask of their Arab friends what we are going to propose to our <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> friends. So, I think that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mediation is the best course.''

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> charged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers who are seeking to secure additional aid for the Contra rebels are egotistically toying with Nicaraguan lives. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a two-hour speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that, despite a Feb. 4 vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> against a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration request for more Contra aid, `` this chapter has not closed.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he said, will look for a way to get more money to the rebels by calling the assistance humanitarian aid. `` If the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves that type of financing, it would be erasing the word peace that it wrote when it voted against the funds, and would be putting -LRB- in -RRB- the word ` war,''' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in the speech, broadcast over a government national radio network. `` That is the little game of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> where many interests, particularly egotistical, are involved and which is playing with life, hunger, security and the self-determination of the Nicaraguan people,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to give the Contras a $ 36.2 million aid package that included about $ 3.6 million for weapons and ammunition to help them in their 6 -LCB- - year-old fight against the leftist Sandinista government Democrats prevailed in the vote, 219-211, after the party's leadership promised members there would be a later chance to vote on a package of Contra aid for food, clothing, medicine and shelter only A group of Democrats, together with one or two Republicans who voted against the president's plan, have been trying to draw up such an alternative. One proposal for the alternative aid request would give the Contras humanitarian aid at a rate of about $ 1.8 million a month. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said 26,500 people have been killed since the war began and 23,882 wounded. Other, unofficial sources, have put the death toll at more than 40,000. The war, he said, has cost the country $ 3.6 billion. Damage to the economy was estimated at $ 376 million last year, exceeding the $ 270 million in export earnings, he said. Even so, he said, the economy advanced at an inflation-adjusted rate of 1.7 percent in 1987. It contracted 0.4 percent in 1986. The inflation rate skyrocketed to 1,347 percent last year, well ahead of the 657 percent of the previous year. The government last week unveiled a new program to try to control runaway inflationm. It introduced a new cordoba currency, boosted prices of basic goods, increased salaries and cracked down on speculators.

 The dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen today, closing at 129.95 yen, while stock prices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> rose moderately. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which posted a 98.05-point gain last Friday, added another 73.30 points or 0.29 percent to close the day's trading at 24,846.71 points. Volume in the first section was 870 million shares. The dollar opened trading Monday at 129.95 yen, down 0.58 yen from last Friday's close of 130.53, and ranged between 129.87 and 130.05 yen. Trading totaled $ 2.526 billion. `` There's absolutely nothing going on'' in the foreign exchange market, said a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The dollar's been moving in a 10-point range in inactive trading. It's extremely, extremely quiet.'' Traders said the dollar's relative stability against the yen was behind the recent upswing of stock prices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Prospects of favorable trade and economic figures for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, helped lift stock prices, said <PERSON> Kunihiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. Other traders said share prices also were boosted by a report published over the weekend that the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> foresees a 4 percent growth in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s gross national product in 1988. Dealers said buying interest faded and volume sagged after a sharp rally in the morning session, as investors began to worry about a correction following the market ` s rally last week.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is likely to find out during a visit by Portuguese Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> this week if a proposed $ 46 million increase in military aid satisfies <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s request for more compensation for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of a major air base. <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s first trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since he took office last August is expected to be dominated by discussion of the base situation, which has injected a dose of sourness into an otherwise sweet relationship between the two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> is getting $ 117 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance this fiscal year _ in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> only <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> got more _ but that was $ 30 million less than the fiscal 1987 payment. In the budget sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> would get $ 163 million. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> wants $ 207 million a year, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators pledged in 1983 they would make their `` best efforts'' to provide in return for a base-rights agreement that gives the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> Lajes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> islands. Besides being part of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> chain of bases, <LOCATION> Lajes </LOCATION> is viewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as an indispensable refueling point for mammoth transports heading for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The grumbling in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> is similar to noises being heard in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ allies seeking more benefits from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in return for use of military installations. `` Security cooperation is an important part of the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and obviously will be discussed during the prime minister's visit,'' the Portuguese embassy said in its announcement of <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s meetings, which include talks with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` There will be further discussions about promised economic assistance,'' the embassy said. Under the terms of the base rights agreement, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has the right to demand a review of the pact at its mid-term, which occurs this month. The form of the review is not spelled out, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said it could result in a demand by <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> for specific amounts of additional aid. After Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> Feb. 3-4, the two countries announced an agreement under which <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> would hold off calls for a formal review of the pact and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would supply surplus military equipment to compensate for the aid cutback. Since then, however, the agreement has come under attack. Portuguese President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> said the surplus equipment agreement is unsatisfactory. In a speech last Thursday, <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> said he favored `` an update'' of the defense accord. Officials of both countries _ notably <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officers sympathetic to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s requests and frustrated by budget strictures _ have said the dispute is purely financial. Unlike in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, where the voters support a reduced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence, there is widespread support for the American bases in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. `` The upcoming Portuguese-American negotiations should n't be dramatized,'' <PERSON> Pinhero </PERSON> said. `` Our common interests and views far exceed any possible bilateral difficulties.''

<NOTE>EDs: Recasts 2nd graf and adds new 3rd graf clarifying Carlucci
agreeing to congressional request to keep Midgetman program alive.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new Pentagon budget has reopened the bitter fight between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the MX nuclear missile and how to build <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future arsenal of land-based atomic weapons. And in the latest round _ on a possible successor to the MX missile _ past administration critics have gained grudging support from an unusual quarter _ <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. Although he personally does n't think much of the Midgetman missile, the congressionally designated heir apparent to the MX, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has agreed to request enough funding to keep the project alive until a new administration can make the final decision. The budget sent to the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week proposed $ 807 million to buy a dozen more of the 10-warhead MX weapons, along with $ 793 million for a new method of basing the giant missiles aboard trains. The current plan is to put 50 of the weapons into silos on <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also wants to build 50 more and deploy two each aboard 25 specially-built trains. But <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week that if it were up to him, he would put all 100 MX weapons on the trains. `` We badly need a survivable missile system,'' he explained. That statement echoed criticisms by MX opponents, who claimed during a series of long fights in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term that putting the MX into land-based silos would make the missiles vulnerable to a first strike by accurate Soviet missiles. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> strongly disagreed and pushed hard for approval for 100 of the weapons. They were to replace some of the aging Minuteman missiles which now make up the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s land-based nuclear missile force. After a series of long fights, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finally agreed to put 50 of the weapons in land-based silos and then approved the single-warhead Midgetman weapon as a successor to the MX. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> agreed with that plan, but later <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided to try to win approval for the second 50 MX weapons. Even as the budget was unveiled Thursday, MX critics were lining up to oppose the railroad-basing plan. `` The debate concerning survivability has been raging for years and apparently will continue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., one of the chief opponents of the weapon in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term `` Based on the available data, serious questions remain regarding the safety and survivability of that type of deployment system,'' said <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>. `` Because of these lingering questions, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must be concerned about the rashness of this proposal.'' Another critic, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., said `` rail garrison would be vulnerable to more than Soviet missiles Because commercial rail lines would be used, the threat of terrorism and sabotage must be considered serious.'' `` Additionally, in light of the recent problems surrounding the safety of our nation's rail system, it is not pleasant to contemplate the thought of nuclear warheads being trundled around through populated areas.'' Both <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> and <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> promised to try to eliminate all money for the rail-basing plan. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also said he wanted to kill the Midgetman program because budgetary restraints made it necessary to choose between Midgetman and the MX. But to meet a congressional request, he included $ 200 million to keep the program alive until a new president takes office next year. That met with the approval of Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a Midgetman supporter `` I felt it would be a mistake to zero the program and I wanted it kept alive for the next administration. This money seems to me to meet that request,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who helped defeat an attempt to kill the Midgetman program two months ago. Of the 50 MX weapons to be deployed, 33 are now in their silos, but only 20 of those are operational because of problems in delivering the guidance systems. But <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said that all 50 will be in the silos by the end of 1988.

<HEAD>Dual-Fuel Cars Seen as Protection Against Price Hikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cars and trucks capable of switching from one fuel to another could discourage future oil price increases by foreign producers, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The department says dual-fuel motor vehicles, in sufficient numbers on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> highways, would offer that benefit even if the foreign oil producers also supplied the second, non-petroleum fuel. In the first of a series of reports planned for this year on alternate fuels, the department says enough twin-fuel vehicles would have to be in use to switch away from about 1 million barrels of oil a day. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> uses almost 17 million barrels of oil per day, a bit more than a third of it imported, and five-eighths of it devoted to transportation. It would take a decade of spending several billion dollars a year to build the plants and distribution system necessary for significant switching ability to methanol or natural gas, the report said. The department and many in the oil industry are worried that imports will account for 60 percent of supplies by the middle of the next decade. That would give the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> leverage it has been unable to exercise in the surplus-sloshed soft markets of recent years, because <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will then have the only spare production capacity available in the world. The department promised more detailed reports on the experience of other countries, supply prospects, environmental effects and a cost-benefit analysis later this year. The most recent report was described as `` context and analytical framework.'' `` Whatever strategy the country goes with has got to withstand cyclical swings in oil prices,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, director of the office of policy, planning and analysis, whose staff did the work. Though other approaches should be pursued, only methanol `` appears at this stage of the assessment to be a fuel with clear potential for meeting a significant percentage of this country's transportation fuel demand in the short run,'' the study said The study director, <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Stagliano </PERSON>, estimated that a dual-fuel car would cost $ 50 to $ 350 more in volume production. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> already has produced several hundred. To cut oil demand by 1 million barrels a day, the report estimated these needs: _ Ten new methanol plants each year for a decade, costing a total of $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion _ Development of 10,000 to 30,000 alternative-capable retail outlets a year, with an eventual total of 150,000 stations costing more than $ 5 billion in all No cost estimate was given for changing pipelines, barges and other distribution facilities to methanol. _ Methanol-compatible vehicles entering the motor vehicle fleet at a rate of 1.5 million to 8 million a year There are more than 170 million cars, trucks and buses on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> highways now. Except in emergencies, motorists would not use methanol unless it were `` perceptibly less expensive'' _ more than two gallons of methanol are needed to provide the mileage obtainable with a gallon of gasoline. `` Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the very prospect of seeing large volumes of the demand for oil translate into demand for alternative fuels will in itself discourage future increases in oil prices,'' the report said. Methanol is made most cheaply from natural gas. The report observed that although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the world's biggest methanol producer, it has been a net importer since 1982, and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries can produce at half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cost. A future methanol market `` could be dominated by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil suppliers, or it might be one in which those countries play a less significant role,'' the report said. Middle Eastern countries could supply <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> methanol needs economically, but `` any increase in the total potential supply of liquid fuels in the world should tend to enhance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy security, because it would cause the world energy market to loosen up,'' the report said. A methanol cartel that raised prices would call forth increased supplies from elsewhere, just as oil output expanded elsewhere in the 1970s after <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> began steep price hikes, the report said. `` Because feedstocks of natural gas are more widely distributed, even greater price competition would result in this case,'' it said.

<HEAD>California Makes Most from Military Contracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> continued to pace the nation last year in the receipt of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts despite suffering a significant drop in awards compared to the previous year, new reports show. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also maintained its position as the state with the largest <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payroll, as well as the No. 1 destination for military retirees. Payroll and pension checks combined pumped $ 12.7 billion into the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> economy in fiscal 1987, the reports show. Nationally, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> awarded $ 147.12 billion in contracts for work performed inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during fiscal 1987 _ a drop of $ 2.1 billion compared to fiscal 1986. It also paid out $ 84.5 billion in payroll and pensions during the year to individuals retired or working inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, up $ 2.7 billion compared to the previous year. Of that $ 84.5 billion grand total, $ 26.3 billion went to pay civilian employees in the 50 states; $ 34 billion went to pay active-duty personnel in the 50 states; $ 5.5 billion went to pay reservists and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members, and $ 18.7 billion went to retirees. The new figures are contained in two annual statistical reports _ one known as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` Atlas'' and the other entitled `` Prime Contract Awards by State'' _ that attempt to show how <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending is affecting the 50 states. Those figures will be augmented in the coming months with additional reports on such things as the nation's top defense contractors; total contract actions, including work outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and civilian and military employee comparisons. The state statistics for fiscal 1987 show that the 12 months ending last Sept. 30 produced some unusually wide swings in Pentagon spending patterns. For example, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> easily paced the nation with military contractors in that state winning $ 24.5 billion in awards. But that total represented an 11.6 percent drop, or $ 3.2 billion less than the $ 27.7 billion in contracts awarded in fiscal 1986. Similarly, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tumbled from second place to fourth in the contract rankings because of 20.9 percent decline in awards, while <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> climbed from eighth to fifth thanks to a whopping 44.5 percent increase in awards. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> finished the fiscal year with awards totaling $ 8.65 billion, while <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> finished with $ 7.8 billion. Second place went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with $ 9.6 billion, while third place went to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with $ 8.69 billion. The remainder of the top 10 included <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> at sixth place with $ 6 billion; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with $ 5.8 billion; <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> with $ 5 billion; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> with $ 4.75 billion, and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> with $ 4.5 billion. Even setting aside contracting, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> benefited the most from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s presence, with $ 12.7 billion flowing into the state in pension checks and salaries for civilian, active-duty and reserve employees. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> rounded out the top five, retaining the same positions in fiscal 1987 they had the year before. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> saw $ 8.8 billion flow into its borders in total compensation, compared to $ 6.6 billion for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 5.6 billion in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and $ 3.2 billion in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The remainder of the top 10 included <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with $ 3 billion in total compensation; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> with $ 2.74 billion; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with $ 2.66 billion; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> with $ 2.4 billion, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with $ 2.3 billion. Breaking down those figures to focus on retiree compensation, the most money again flowed into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ totaling $ 2.7 billion. Next was <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with $ 1.9 billion, followed by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with $ 1.88 billion; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> with $ 1.4 billion and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> with $ 682.5 million.

<HEAD>Effectiveness Of Anti-Drug Programs Needs Evaluating,
Investigators Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal watchdog says it is time to use a few of the millions of dollars spent annually on anti-drug education to answer a simple question: What works and what does n't? That was the conclusion reached by Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> after he was asked by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to evaluate a variety of programs. In weeks of studying <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Just Say No'' campaign and two other antidrug efforts targeted at the very young, investigators found more questions than answers. The main recommendation in a preliminary version of <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>'s report is that federal agencies `` should develop an evaluation strategy to include long - and short-term evaluations of the implementation and effectiveness of youth drug education programs Specifically, he said those strategies should be devised by the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Alcohol, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>, charged with monitoring programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to discuss the study after The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a draft copy. He acknowledged that the document lacks the precision typically associated with IG reports, but said that should not be read as an indictment of any of the programs surveyed. In fact, he said, `` It looks like they're on the right track.'' But the former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent said his investigators' attempts to determine whether the programs are `` just fluff and puffery or real'' were hampered by lack of measurable data. `` There is no evidence that seems to be available to tell us how successful these programs are,'' he said. `` I think we've put the first layer in, but if you want to have an ongoing, effective program we're going to get more sophisticated. You can not get sophisticated until you start developing some objective criteria and some instruments to measure progress. `` Our concern is that if these programs satisfy themselves that they can relax on their laurels and sort of coast on to ever increasing success, I think they're deluding themselves. If we want to increase the effectiveness of the programs we are going to have some sort of measurement that would allow them to know what are successful techniques versus the less successful techniques.'' <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> added: `` You're not talking about hoards of money to do that. You're just saying that somewhere along the line they're going to have to set aside some resource to look at how they can go about developing a model they can measure.

<HEAD>US Schools Issue More Education Doctorates Than Any Other Kind</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American universities have awarded more doctorates in education than in any other field over the past two decades, and women outnumber men among the newest Ph.D. s, a government study says `` Education has been the most popular field of choice for doctoral study since 1966,'' said the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Statistics. The report, based on federal surveys, said that in 1966, education held a narrow lead over the physical sciences as the most popular field of doctoral-level study. Of the 18,239 doctorates awarded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities that year, 3,063, or 17 percent, were in education, compared to 3,045 in the physical sciences. In 1986, education was still in the No. 1 spot, but by a much wider margin. It accounted for 7,110, or 21 percent, of the 33,653 Ph.D. s awarded The physical sciences again were second with 3,551. But education's share of doctorates peaked in 1977 at 7,960 and has declined steadily since then as fewer men pursued the advanced degree. Men outnumbered women four-to-one among the education Ph.D. s in 1966 Women took the lead in 1983 and outnumbered the men in 1986, 3,795 to 3,315. The 7,110 education Ph.D. s in 1986 was the lowest since 1972 The report, `` Profile of Education Doctorates: 1976 to 1986,'' was written by the center's <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Summer </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitener </PERSON>. Education administration and supervision was the most popular specialty, accounting for 1,622 of the Ph.D.'s in 1986. Some 787 were in curriculum and instruction, 609 in higher education, 323 in educational psychology and 315 in counseling and personnel services. A total of 1,141 of the Ph.D. s were in various subjects or teaching fields, with physical education, health and recreation the most popular -LRB- 291 -RRB-, followed by reading education -LRB- 134 -RRB-, music education -LRB- 94 -RRB-, trade and industrial education -LRB- 86 -RRB- and English education -LRB- 79 -RRB- The report said 194 of the 438 doctoral-granting institutions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> awarded education Ph.D. s in 1986 The top 10 were: <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 171; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, 165; <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, both 163; <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 149; <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> 139; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, 129; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas-Austin </ORGANIZATION>, 125; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland-College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, 124; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts-Amherst </ORGANIZATION>, 112.

 Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> says he believes the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> primary election this May will determine the presidential nominees for both the Democrats and the Republicans. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said Sunday he thinks the state will play the pivotal role because the May 3 primary will fall at a key time in the nominating process and because of the nature of the state. `` I think that the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> primary will determine who the nominee is for each of the parties,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said in answer to a question at a news conference. `` They -LRB- the winners -RRB- may not have all the delegates, but I think ... it will be clear that they are going to be the first-ballot choice.'' `` Any nominee understands that to win the general election, they must carry <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>. `` Our state is kind of a fulcrum in the political process, it seems to me.'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said it is too early for him to try to influence the nominating process by endorsing a candidate, but that he may do so prior to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> primary.

<HEAD>Republicans Vote To Ban Pre-Primary Endorsements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republican Party has voted to prohibit any endorsement by either the statewide party or any official <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> county central committee prior to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. In a three-day convention, noteworthy principally for the absence of all of the party's presidential candidates who are campaigning in states with `` Super Tuesday'' primaries on March 8, the only other significant business was adoption of new rules for naming members to the party's governing board. The ban on endorsements Sunday was in response to a 1986 court ruling that a state law prohibiting such endorsements violated constitutional free speech guarantees. However, that ruling left the political parties free to adopt any rules they want restricting themselves. Contrary to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> action Sunday, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic party is expected to adopt rules permitting pre-primary endorsements at its statewide convention next month.

<HEAD>DOE Reduces Savannah River Reactor Level After Scientists Warn of
Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Managers of a federal nuclear plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> said a recent power-level reduction was `` routine,'' but a published report today says the action came after scientists discovered that safety equations had been wrong for decades. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that power levels at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> weapons material plant reactor were reduced following a stormy meeting during which private scientists warned that the reactor was operating beyond the demonstrated capacity of its emergency cooling system. Managers of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> called the 10 percent reduction in power _ the third reduction in 14 months _ a `` routine'' action reflecting a change in the way reactor temperatures are measured. The reduction dropped the operating level from 1,100 megawatts thermal to 960 megawatts. Power had already been reduced from 2,200 megawatts last March when a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> panel warned that a severe accident could overpower the reactor's cooling system. The Post, quoting sources it did not identify, said the latest reduction Feb. 12 was ordered only at the insistence of scientists working for E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s contractor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The scientists had discovered a fundamental error in the calculations that have been used for decades to justify reactor operating levels, the newspaper said. Department of Energy officials initially were reluctant to order the reduction because they did n't want to admit they had made a mistake and risk triggering public pressure to close the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> facility, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. DOE confirmed that the power levels at the L reactor _ one of three government reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facility and the last <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> facility that produces plutonium _ were reduced Feb. 12, the newspaper said. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> decided to reduce the levels following a confrontation with the scientists at a Feb. 8 meeting during which a top du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> scientist threw his security badge on the table in front of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> and threatened to `` go public'' unless the power levels were lowered, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s sources said. `` Morgan blinked,'' one source told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. An unidentified DOE official told the newspaper that the department did not want to `` raise the specter of continuing problems at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Sister of Longest-Held Hostage Says Government Has Double Standard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The sister of the longest-held American hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials display a double standard by working hardest to free the most recent captives. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, who has unflinchingly worked for freedom for her brother <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials indicated recently that no progress has been made to win his release. `` I will not stand by and watch somebody else come out while my brother stays behind,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted March 16, 1985. He is among nine Americans being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including recent abductee Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was kidnapped Wednesday. Mrs. Say charged that a double standard exists in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials actively tried to locate <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but have not been as vigorous in trying to find her brother. She added that the double standard is not new, and she cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to free Americans held hostage in the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and the cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> and the negotiations to win the release of journalist <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON>, who was arrested by the Soviets. She said that during a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> meeting several months ago, she was told that `` their policy was absolute non-negotiations for <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and the others.'' `` I reminded them that they had told me that before <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and I watched those negotiations,'' she said. `` And then they got back to me and said, now we're back to our old policy, no negotiations. I watched <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> and I watched <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON>. `` And I said to them a couple of months ago, I do not intend to stand by again and watch you break that public policy when it is politically expedient for you to do so.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday he wants `` to rescue'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who headed the 75-man observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but officials played down the idea of a military mission to gain the officer's release.

<HEAD>Two Years After Marcos, Aquino Administration More Secure Than
Ever</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has weathered coup attempts and other political storms, begins her third year in office Thursday more secure in power than at any time during her administration. But many who saw the Feb. 22-25, 1986, uprising against President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as the beginning of a new era in Philippine politics are disappointed that dreams of social progress and reform remain unrealized. The coalition that propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power _ reformist soldiers, human rights activists, the church and business groups _ has been shattered in the bickering that followed. Two years after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' downfall, land reform remains bogged down in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Human rights groups that once castigated <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for the abuses of his administration now raise similar charges against the Aquino government. During a radio broadcast Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> described her first two years in office as `` very difficult.'' `` I do not describe it as enjoyment,'' she said. `` But definitely it is fulfillment of the highest decree.'' She said improving the economic condition of the Filipino people would be her first priority in the coming year. Last week, the major topic of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers was a debate over calls for a `` limited state of emergency,'' raising dark memories of the worst excesses of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> era. `` It appears that the anniversary will confirm the demise of a failed reformist revolution,'' wrote commentator <PERSON> Amando </PERSON> <PERSON> Doronila </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will show that the revolution, two years after, is like a crushed ant hill, with its inhabitants scurrying about without direction and in disarray.'' Despite the disillusionment, most Western and Philippine analysts doubt that disgruntled military officers, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists or communist rebels can topple the popular 55-year-old widow before her term expires on June 30, 1992. Military challenges to the Aquino administration reached their high-water mark in August, when mutineers seized media and military installations before being driven off about 15 hours later. The leader of the August attempt, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, was arrested in December. Ironically, he played a major role in the Feb. 22, 1986, military mutiny that triggered the popular uprising Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> rode to power. Most analysts believe that communist rebels appear to lack both the military strength and political following to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> within the next four years. `` The question used to be, ` Will <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> make it to 1992?''' said one Western analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Now it is, ` What will she do in the rest of her term?''' Beyond surviving, the principal achievement of the Aquino administration has been the restoration of popular democracy, marked by ratification of a liberal constitution and the elections of senators, congressmen and regional officials. Last week, however, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> noted that there were 700 allegations of fraud in the Jan. 18 regional election. He said those who believe real democracy has been restored `` are more obsessed with theory than actual fact.'' Prospects for broad social, economic and political reform have been clouded by a $ 28 billion debt, a cumbersome legislature and political polarization widened by the 19-year-old communist insurgency and the military's rising clout. For much of her term, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> faced serious challenges from the military, and she owes her political survival in part to a faction under <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>. As chief of staff, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> held most of the armed forces behind the government and fended off the six coup plots. But social activists fear her reliance on <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> has lessened the government's commitment to reform The government so far has not prosecuted soldiers for alleged involvement in several widely publicized killings of civilians. Nor has it fulfilled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s 1986 campaign promise to abolish the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a military-backed militia widely accused of human rights abuses. And the government has endorsed formation of about 200 anti-communist vigilante groups, which human rights activists and church groups have accused of widespread abuses. `` She had one thing which could have put aside these challenges,'' said <PERSON> Mariss </PERSON> <PERSON> Diokno </PERSON>, a prominent human rights activist. `` And that was the people. Instead of turning to the people, she turned to the military to bail her out. That is the tragic element.'' Friction between the military and civilian branches burst into the open last week over proposals for the limited state of emergency to deal with communist rebels. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Honesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Isleta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>' former spokesman, suggested such a step to deal with the communists. Rep. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutang </PERSON>, a retired general, proposed a national security act similar to those in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, which allow for detention without charge for 60 days. After criticism from liberal congressmen and the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> press, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said there was no need for a state of emergency. But he called for `` tougher laws,'' including a national identity card system, longer detention for suspected rebels and reimposition of the death penalty. Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON>, a former presidential spokesman and human rights lawyer, accused the military of `` blackmail,'' and Sen. <PERSON> Teofisto </PERSON> <PERSON> Guingona </PERSON> branded the identity card system as the trappings of a police state. In a page-one commentary Sunday, the pro-Aquino <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said the ouster of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had given the country `` a new lease on life, a new chance to make dreams ... into realities.'' It added: `` Today, all those dreams remain, for the most part, still dreams.''

 Motorists paid an average half-cent a gallon less for gasoline during the past two weeks than during the previous two weeks, but prices should rise soon, an analyst says. The average retail price of gasoline fell to 96.12 cents per gallon since the Feb. 5 survey of prices at 15,000 gas stations nationwide, <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. As of Feb. 19, the average for all grades and types of service including taxes was 96.12 cents, compared with 96.59 cents on Feb. 5, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. Average wholesale prices showed virtually no change, meaning a loss in the retail operating margin of more than a half cent, the survey said. That, plus the heavier demand for gasoline in warmer weather will add to existing upward pressure on prices, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said.

 A rash of railroad accidents last month should show <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that serious problems remain in the industry since the worst wreck in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> history 14 months ago, says <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>.

Sixteen people were killed. `` It's incredible to me that we're sitting here 14 months after the Chase accident and not one shred of legislation introduced in the wake of that accident has yet become law,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said during an interview he requested to talk about safety concerns. `` As the months pass, I see the opportunity slipping away from us,'' he said. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> has been lobbying for measures before <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committees that would permit direct government sanctions against railroad workers for safety violations, and authorize random drug testing. Delays in enacting the sanctions measure is `` testimony to the sheer political power of the labor organizations who oppose it,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dentists From Across the Globe Meet To Discuss AIDS and Lasers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS and lasers top the list of issues as thousands of dentists gathered for the 123rd midwinter meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Only a few dentists now use lasers as surgical tools to remove lesions and damaged soft tissue from around gums. But experts predict dentists will soon use lasers to do everything from fitting crowns to drilling cavities, said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigdor </PERSON>, chief of dental service at <ORGANIZATION> Ravenswood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The four-day conference, which started Sunday, is expected to attract 27,000 dentists and technicians from 26 countries. AIDS poses challenges because of the small chance of dentists' contracting it from patients and the difficulty of treating symptoms of the disease, said Dr. <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, chairman of Oral Medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said he will urge dentists to wear gloves to protect themselves from contracting AIDS from patients. He said he would impress upon them they are legally and morally obligated to treat people with AIDS. Only one dentist is believed to have contracted AIDS by treating patients with the deadly virus without taking the proper percautions. Another dentist has tested positive for antibodies to the virus, but has not yet shown symptoms of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said. `` The risk of contracting the virus is very, very low _ but why take the chance?'' he said. AIDS patients develop many symptoms that must be treated by a dentist, such as mouth lesions, ulcers, fungus and other lumps and bumps, he said. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said he will instruct dentists how to treat these problems and give them information on how to refer the AIDS patients if the dentist can not handle treatment. He said he would instruct dentists how to spot early symptoms of AIDS and how to refer them for additional medical assistance. A French Dentist, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duret </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Marseilles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to present his new computerized laser systems, which may revolutionize current procedures for crowns and bridges, <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafalson </PERSON> said. Doctors discussed the future uses of lasers at preconference workshops at <LOCATION> Ravenswood </LOCATION> hospital Saturday. Lasers offer the advantages of being bloodless, very clean and causing less post-treatment pain, he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wenske </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said his laboratory is trying to develop a laser drill `` to get rid of the noise and vibration ... that patients find so adverse'' when they are having cavities drilled. The high cost of laser equipment _ $ 20,000 to $ 25,000 _ prevents most individual dentists from purchasing it, <PERSON> Widgor </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Widgor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who helped organize the workshops, said prices are expected to drop dramatically in the next few years to an affordable level.

 A moderate earthquake shook central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, jarring residents awake as it sent dishes rattling and house beams creaking but caused no injuries or major damage, officials said. The quake, measuring 3.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, hit at 11:43 p.m. Sunday, and was centered about 40 miles west-northwest of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>'s seismology laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. Shaking was felt over a broad area in <LOCATION> Kern </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> counties, and as far north as <PERSON> Paso </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, about 75 miles away. `` It rattled some dishes and caused some attic beams to creak, but after the initial fright, most of our callers settled right down,'' said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. `` We've had about a dozen calls, spread out over about 40 miles,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` It woke people up, but there were n't any reports of injury or damage.'' Residents in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> and nearby <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> felt the ground shake, but <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> police officers said they barely noticed the temblor. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the open-ended scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

<TEXT>
 Passengers and crew members on a <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight today prevented a Taiwanese man from hijacking the plane to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by hitting him over the head and wrestling him to the floor, the airline said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliner was carrying 114 people, including one American, on a flight from <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> to the southern port city of <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>, 240 miles away, when the hijack attempt by the 29-year-old man occurred. The man, an employee at a knife grinding shop, was carrying two fake grenades made of wood and a slip of paper from a fortuneteller predicting a year of bad luck, the airline said at a news conference. According to the airline, the would-be hijacker was subdued after a crew member hit him on the head with a `` hard object.'' No injuries were reported among the other 106 passengers and seven crew members aboard the jetliner. The plane landed at <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION> and later returned to <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> where members of the cabin crew appeared at a press conference. <PERSON> Stewardess </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> said she was passing out drinks to the passengers about 20 minutes after takeoff when the would-be hijacker, <PERSON> Chien </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu-yuan </PERSON>, handed her a slip of paper demanding the plane be diverted to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` He threatened on the slip of paper that he would kill all of us with his two grenades if we did n't fly to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' she said. The man later said he wanted to go to <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, but crew members said he was nervous and probably meant <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The would-be hijacker claimed to have two partners, but the airline has ruled out that possibility. The stewardess asked four stewards for help as most passengers remained unaware of the unfolding drama. The stewards and a few passengers then pounced on the hijacker when he tried to show the phony grenades to the passengers and subdued him after a 10-minute scuffle. `` We asked the captain to fly in circles and told the hijacker we would divert to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' said steward <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsi-an </PERSON>. Police said the would-be hijacker, a native Taiwanese who worked in his brother's knife grinding shop, was in custody in <LOCATION> Kaohsuing </LOCATION>. Attempted hijacking can carry the death sentence in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Officials were unsure how many foreigners were aboard the plane besides the one American. Among the passengers was <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yueh-ying </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION> county magistrate who is an opposition member. In 1985, an attempted hijacking occurred aboard a <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 flying the same route with 107 passengers. In that incident, a homesick army sergeant who wanted to see his parents was overpowered by crew members after he seized a stewardess.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> says he rebuffed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s proposal that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> help lure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> where they would be attacked by nuclear weapons, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s two-volume memoir covers nearly 50 years of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomacy, including dealings with nine <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which said an advance copy was made available to its <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureau. In `` Memoir,'' expected to be distributed to bookstores in the next few weeks by its Soviet publisher, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> says <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s proposal came during a secret visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in August 1958. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, Soviet foreign minister from 1957 to 1985, said he was surprised by the audacity of the plan, according to the Times. `` The scenario of war described by you can not meet a positive response by us,'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. `` I can say this with certainty.'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 78, wrote that <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was anticipating an American attack on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because of tensions over the islands of <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION>, off mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> forces would retreat to the heartland of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, luring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers after them. Then, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> proposed, `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should catch them with all its means,'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> wrote. At the time, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was expecting to receive nuclear weapons from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> withdrew their offer in 1959. Soviet officials later accused <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> of recklessness. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> exploded its own nuclear bomb in 1964. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> denies reports that he misled President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> about the presence of Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> during the 1962 missile crisis. `` In spite of several allegations circulating in the West, not once in the whole course of the conversation did <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> raise the question of the presence of Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' he wrote. `` Consequently, I did not have to answer whether or not there were such weapons in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who dealt with every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president from <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reserved special praise for Roosevelt. He describes <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> as someone `` who knew how to conduct conversation freely, without any tension,'' and a leader who knew how to make and carry out policy. He also described meetings with American stars such as <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, whom he met during a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> reception for Soviet officials in 1959.

It's hard work, some of the 27 volunteer judges tapped this year said over the weekend. `` We taste a lot of different wines and try to decide, try to be objective,'' <PERSON> Opal </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to say anything bad about them, but some of them ...'' She trailed off, perhaps not wishing to leave a bitter aftertaste. Since wine can be made from nearly anything organic, some of the entries are, well, unusual. Garlic, dried kiwi fruit, rose petals, zucchini and even sauerkraut have found their way into bottles during past competitions. `` A little sauerkraut wine is good on a cold night,'' judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Swafford </PERSON> said dryly. Stomach aches are unlikely, since the rules say the judges are supposed to sniff, swirl, taste and spit. Still, the volunteer judges must sign a waiver releasing the chamber from any blame should they be struck with a sudden illness, and nobody else is allowed the taste the amateur wines that are displayed at the festival. The festival, which opened Friday and runs through Feb. 28, allows the public to taste commercial wines, and compare their choices with results from a panel of professional judges.

 Whales are coming to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The Shedd Aquarium says its Oceanarium, a $ 43 million expansion project that should be completed by 1990, will exhibit six whales, four dolphins, several sea otters and a rookery of penguins. The Oceanarium design calls for huge rocks, cliffs and 35-foot trees on 1.8 acres of what was <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> before 30 million gallons of water was siphoned so construction could begin below lake level in August. To give the illusion the whales are in the ocean, a 600-foot-long 35-foot-high picture window will overlook the lake from behind their tanks. `` I've got a gut feeling that we might even have to turn people away,'' aquarium director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braker </PERSON> said recently as cranes pounded 75-foot-long steel pilings for the foundation. `` We had 1.1 million visitors in 1987, and with the Oceanarium, I think we may hit 2 million.'' Three milk-white, 15-foot beluga whales will be airlifted from <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, aquarium officials said. As whales go, Manitobas are small, but the largest animal now at <LOCATION> Shedd </LOCATION> is a 7-foot nurse shark. Three more <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> black whales, about the size of <LOCATION> Manitobas </LOCATION>, will be brought from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the aquarium staff said. <PERSON> Braker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shedd </PERSON>, which opened in 1929 and is the world's largest indoor aquarium at 230,000 square feet, `` needed a good shot in the arm to bring it out of many years of being static. Money for the Oceanarium includes $ 5 million each from the state and the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. The aquarium has spent $ 8 million and hopes to raise the remainder of the $ 25 million price tag through donations.

 The dollar drifted lower against most major currencies in light European trading early today. Gold prices rose after dipping in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Traders attributed the dollar's weakness to general bearish sentiment fueled by uncertainty over the state of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. `` The dollar's short-term trend is definitely down,'' said a senior trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` Some people might like to see the dollar rise, but what fresh news is there to support it?'' A trader in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said the dollar had been boosted by a narrowing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, but `` you ca n't hang on the trade data only _ you need something else to chew on.

 Police clashed with about 100 separatist demonstrators today at a hospital construction site, and authorities said 10 officers were injured and a dozen were taken hostage in the melee. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Berges </PERSON>, chief of staff at the High Commission, said the protesters at <LOCATION> Poindimie </LOCATION> on the east side of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island were demanding a halt to work on the site.

He said the team of gendarmes, a police force under military direction, showed great restraint by not firing their weapons when they were attacked with stones and sticks.

<TEXT>
 Family members denied published reports the exiled eldest son of the late President <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> will return home to face charges that he participated in attacks on Israeli and American diplomats. An opposition weekly, <PERSON> Sawt-el-Arab </PERSON>, on Sunday quoted the fugitive, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, as saying he planned to return from exile in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> to stand trial. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. The state-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> reported today that entry points in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> were placed on alert for the possible return of <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> also said <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Khawaga </PERSON>, a defense attorney and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, had flown to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, seeking to bring back <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s newspapers said authorities in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> obtained political asylum, were notified through <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> that he is a fugitive. However, a member of the <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> family, who spoke today with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> has no intention of coming home to face trial. Another family member, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s brother-in-law <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Marawan </PERSON>, also reportedly said the defendant refuses to come home. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, 38, is one of 11 defendants charged in connection with four shooting attacks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> between 1984 and 1987 that killed two Israelis and wounded six Israelis and two Americans. Nine other defendants, including <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawky </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, a nephew of the late president who also is at large, are charged with lesser crimes in connection with the alleged conspiracy. In announcing the charges last week, government officials said all defendants except the <ORGANIZATION> Nassers </ORGANIZATION> were in custody or free on bail. Sources close to the fugitives told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the two were advised early in the investigation to leave <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, apparently to avoid the embarrassment to the government of having to arrest close relatives of a man still adored in much of the Arab world. `` <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s name has been placed on the list of -LRB- people -RRB- expected to return to Egyptian airports and ports,'' <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said <PERSON> el-Khawaga </PERSON>, the attorney, hoped to persuade <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> to turn himself in to Egyptian authorities. <PERSON> El-Khawaga </PERSON>'s office confirmed the attorney's departure but gave no details Although <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> have no extradition treaty, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> speculated that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will use diplomatic channels to extradite <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>. The Nasserite weekly Sawt-el-Arab claimed Sunday that <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> said in a telephone conversation from <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> that `` I have faith in the Egyptian judiciary system'' and would return when the trial begins. A trial date has not yet been set.

<TEXT>
 Teen-agers dressed in punk fashions were among more than 1,000 mourners who packed a church for the funeral of four family members who police believe were hacked to death with an ax by a 16-year-old son. Two bishops, nine priests and a monsignor presided over a 90-minute Mass Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Pax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> and two of their children, 11-year-old <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and 14-year-old <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, a high school sophomore described as a gentle boy who wrote poetry but who also favored hard-core punk music, was charged with murder Friday in the deaths of his parents and younger brother and sister. `` We have no idea what all these things can mean,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Syl </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pax </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>'s pastor. `` They have left so many memories,'' he said of the <PERSON> Broms </PERSON>, active members of the church. `` We come here with a spirit of absolute loss. We have no idea what response we can make. But we can see the light their lives has given us,'' he said. The service included readings by classmates of <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, and presentations of symbolic gifts. Among the gifts was a high school basketball trophy given in memory of <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, who had been a cheerleader for her school's basketball team. A special section was set aside for teen-agers, including a few with hair dyed black, gold or purple. After the service, about 100 people braved a raw wind at <LOCATION> Calvary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> for the burial. The family's oldest son, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 19, appeared stoic at the graveside. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who did not live with his family, has asked to be appointed guardian of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the slayings. Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> has said he understands that <PERSON> David </PERSON> had argued recently with his father about a music cassette. The Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Krough </PERSON>, chaplain at <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said friends had recently heard <PERSON> David </PERSON> muse about wanting to hurt his family. A favorite of <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s, according to one friend, is the group Suicidal Tendencies. A song on their latest album describes `` the maniac I'll meet. His love for me is like a father to a son. And now the maniac and I are one.'' Other friends said the teen-ager was always ready with a joke and a smile, and `` would n't step on a flower.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, teachers and psychologists are monitoring <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s classmates for signs of depression. `` The difficult time is yet to come,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, a licensed psychologist who interviewed about 50 of <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s classmates Some will sink into depression in 15 to 20 days, he said. Some will withdraw, while others will become unruly and irritable. Some will pull out of the depression in a few days, while others may sink deeper. `` Some of them will have a difficult time working this through,'' <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said. `` They'll say things like, ` What's the use, what's the point of going on?'''

 Jurors have recommended that a man whose death sentence was overturned should be resentenced to die, in spite of character witness testimony by other death row inmates who described him as generous and caring. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, 31, was convicted and sentenced to death in 1977 for the rape-murder of his 13-year-old stepniece. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned his sentence last April. After a three-day resentencing trial, jurors voted 7-5 Saturday to recommend that <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> be executed for the crime. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Formet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> is not required to follow the jury's recommendation in his decision, which will be announced Wednesday. Although <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> confessed to the slaying shortly after his arrest in July 1976, he later recanted and blamed the killing on his older brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who <PERSON> James </PERSON> said had become enraged when he caught the defendant and victim having sex. <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> testified Saturday he confessed to the slaying because `` I thought I was doing the right thing for my brother. ... I loved him. I covered it up.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, 38, denied the accusation last week as he did 11 years ago, when <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Driggers </PERSON> died. He was not charged in his stepdaughter's death. The resentencing jury also heard testimony Friday from eight convicted killers, who portrayed <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> as a model prisoner, a peacemaker, teacher and generous person who should be spared from the electric chair. They said <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> taught them to read and write, broke up fights and loaned them money for tennis shoes and cigarettes. `` <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> does n't belong there,'' said death row inmate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. `` He's trying to help people ... He does n't need to die.''

Actor <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, the mayor of nearby <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, presented <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> with the award Sunday night at the $ 150-a-plate, black-tie affair that ended the three-day festival. Several of his leading ladies, among them Doris Day and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, were on hand as a tribute to <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who turns 80 on May 20.

Letters were read from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a former actor, who said that <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s name on a marquee was `` an iron-clad guarantee of quality,'' and Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who said that <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> `` lifted the spirits of young and old alike.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> looked fit during his visit to the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, though he admitted at a news conference Sunday afternoon that he is having a hard time hearing. `` You'd all better speak up,'' he said with a smile. Of his career, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said he is grateful he was able to play so many different roles. `` I had all sorts of parts,'' he said. `` Comedy, westerns, the serious and thought-provoking.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, the star of such classics as `` It's a Wonderful Life'' and `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' was asked what he thought of computer colorization of his old black and white films. `` Colorization is one of the most disgraceful things that ever happened in any endeavor in this country,'' he said. `` I hope the people who perpetrate this on others go flat broke someday soon. `` The actors end up with orange faces. The cameraman took all this time, all this time to create depth and to cast the right shadows. With colorization, people just walk around, just walk around like painted Easter eggs.''

 Palestinians today held memorial services for the 61 Arabs killed by Israelis in anti-occupation violence, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attorney general ruled soldiers could not use force to punish or humiliate protesters. Also today, hospital officials said a 14-year-old Arab boy was wounded in the thigh in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army reported an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was arrested after trying to attack an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier with a knife in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. It was the third such attack on soldiers in four days. Leaflets distributed by underground Palestinian groups in the occupied territories called for demonstrations this week _ beginning with memorial services on `` Martyrs Day'' today _ to protest the visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Army officials said the five-day visit, scheduled to start Thursday, might prompt an escalation in violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` It's not organized or systematic, but outside events like the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit do affect the situation,'' an army spokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of anonymity. Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> saying soldiers may not use force as a means of punishment or humiliation, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Orders that call for such use of force are illegal, ruled <PERSON> Harish </PERSON>, who demanded <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> issue appropriate instructions to the troops. <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> said many Palestinians have complained to him about abuse by soldiers. In an army survey, 65 percent of soldiers questioned said they had witnessed rough treatment of Palestinians by troops, said the army's chief psychologist, Col. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON>. The radio did not say how many soldiers were questioned. <PERSON> Dover </PERSON> said 70 percent felt angry and frustrated by the situation in the occupied lands and said they thought using the army to break up civilian protests damages its effectiveness to fight a war. Dover told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that 92 percent of the soldiers questioned expressed full trust in their commanders. `` We do n't have problems with the motivation of soliders ... not that they rejoice to do it, but it's an assignment that has been given to the army and that's how it is seen by the soldiers,'' he said. Since the wave of protests began Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> War, Israelis have killed 61 Palestinians. The latest fatalities were two men shot and killed by soldiers Sunday. The government has spent $ 330 million, or 1 percent of the government's 1988 budget, in an attempt to quell the violence. In one memorial services today, women marched to a cemetery in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION> to honor three residents who died in clashes with the army earlier this month. A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> car in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, but no one was injured, the army said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp of Jabaliya, soldiers clashed with protesters, and a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh, doctors at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, anti-American slogans painted in red on closed store shutters read: `` No to the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit. Yes to the Palestinian government. Yes to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has ordered Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> not to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, saying he is pro-Israeli and has rejected minimal Palestinian demands. But local <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders said today that they were trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to lift the ban. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials met with several <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives over the weekend to discuss the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit. During his visit, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will present to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative calling for an international forum for direct talks on Palestinian self-rule and negotiations on a final settlement by December. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told European Jewish leaders Sunday night he objected to the hurried pace: `` Any attempt to force the pace and shorten the period -LRB- of self-rule -RRB- would be a detriment to the very essence of the agreement.'' He also indicated he would not give in to pressure to accept the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plan: `` When the time comes for decisions, we shall decide on the basis of what is in our national interests.''

<HEAD>Authorities Find Body In Trailer, Relatives Say `God Dealing With
Him'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REFORM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Relatives of a man whose decomposed body was found about three weeks after his death apparently were convinced that he was still alive, officials said. `` I understand they were seeing a voodoo man,'' <LOCATION> Pickens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latham </PERSON> said of the deceased man and his relatives. <LOCATION> Pickens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abston </PERSON> identified the dead man as <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Latham </PERSON>, 42, not related to the coroner. The body was discovered in a bedroom in a mobile home Wednesday by county health workers, authorities said. The coroner said the man had been dead about three weeks. `` He was pretty well decomposed at the time and the odor all around the trailer was pretty strong,'' <PERSON> Abston </PERSON> said. `` Some of the kids playing in the yard were wearing face masks, like in an operating room.'' The coroner said the dead man's relatives `` tried to convince me that he was still alive, that God was dealing with him, that he was fine.'' `` This was a weird case,'' he said Sunday, a day after the body was buried. The coroner said that although no foul play was suspected, he was awaiting hospital records from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Latham </PERSON> had received some treatment, before announcing the cause of death. The coroner said <PERSON> Latham </PERSON> apparently was aware he was suffering from a fatal disease. The autopsy did not reveal the exact disease, he said. <PERSON> Abston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Latham </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> recently from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and was picked up at the <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by his sister, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Latham </PERSON>, who took him to a motel in Reform. The two stayed there for two weeks. <PERSON> Dilip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhakta </PERSON>, the motel manager, said he never saw <PERSON> Latham </PERSON>, but asked <PERSON> Latham </PERSON>'s sister to leave the motel Feb. 2 `` because of the smell.'' `` She never would let anyone come in the room and would meet our maids at the door to get materials,'' <PERSON> Bhakta </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bhakta </PERSON> said the odor `` was very strong, very offensive'' and that there were several complaints from other guests. Ms. <PERSON> Latham </PERSON> said she took her brother to a man in <LOCATION> Hale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who told him to drink goat's milk with some pills he gave him. She said she took her brother to the mobile home on Feb. 2. The nine occupants of the trailer included two infants and several teen-agers, the coroner said. Ms. <PERSON> Latham </PERSON> dismissed the claim that her brother was treated by a `` voodoo doctor.'' <PERSON> Abston </PERSON> said she told him that her brother was alive when he was moved and did not die until the day authorities found his body. L.C. <PERSON> Keasler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pickens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said agency workers went to the trailer Feb. 14 after an anonymous tip, but were refused entrance. The agency workers returned Wednesday with police. Asked if any supernatural elements or voodoo were involved in <PERSON> Latham </PERSON>'s treatment, his sister told The <ORGANIZATION> Tuscaloosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday: `` I do n't like to use that word. I'm not working for the devil _ I work for God. `` All I could do was minister to him. He's in God's hands now.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now that the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has been saved, readers and employees wonder what the nation's oldest continuously published newspaper will look like under the new owner, and whether he'll stop its money-losing ways. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, who is buying the tabloid from <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for $ 37.6 million, spent Sunday talking with advisers about what direction to take the Post. The paper's 10 unions agreed Saturday to $ 22 million in concessions that <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> said were necessary to keep the paper alive. That includes eliminating 130 of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,200 jobs. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> is widely thought to want to back away from the paper's emphasis on stories of sex, crime and scandal It will remain a tabloid, but `` there will be a change in format,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>. `` There'll be changes in headlines, in the front page, in the emphasis of the paper.'' But, <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> added, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> `` still wants it to be feisty and provocative.'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> bought the paper in 1976 and fashioned it after the British tabloids. Soon readers were seeing such headlines as `` HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR,'' which ran above a story about a homicide in a tavern. They saw a photo of Prince <PERSON> Rainier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION> looking into, and making an obscene hand gesture at, a Post photographer's lens. The caption read: `` THE PRINCE GIVES US THE FINGER.'' And then there was the story about <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s reported psychological problems, featuring a photograph doctored to show readers what he would look like dressed as a woman, complete with lipstick and earrings. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, a real estate developer and businessman worth an estimated $ 500 million, has approved a $ 2 million promotional campaign for the newspaper, said <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>. According to his agreement with <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> promised to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in operation for at least one year after he takes over March 7. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> lost about $ 17 million before taxes last year, and about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months. Its circulation has dropped from 700,000 to 500,000, partly because of a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A $ 1 million marketing study commissioned by <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> `` shows the paper already appeals to a fairly well-to-do audience,'' <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A pro-Iranian extremist group today released a videotaped message from a kidnapped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine colonel calling on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to meet his captors' demands. The 70-second tape from the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> was accompanied by a typewritten Arabic statement reiterating the group's claim that the hostage, Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, is a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent. The Arabic statement also warned <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s mainstream Shiite Moslem militia, Amal, to stop searching for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, who was abducted Wednesday near the southern port city of Tyre. Amal, which continued its search today, has taken into custody dozens of members of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most radical Shiite group. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which is believed to be the umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding most of the 24 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, on Sunday declared support for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' captors. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militimen clashed in a brief firefight Sunday. No casualties were reported in the half-hour shootout in the southeastern village of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Tineh </PERSON>. In the videotape delivered today to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, an unshaven <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> appears to be reading from a statement. The statement by <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has to take responsibility for the crimes he has committed against the oppressed people in the region.'' In the statement, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> then lists the same demands his captors made when they first claimed his abduction Friday in a statement that called the colonel a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the spying charge. The demands, as given by <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, are: _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the self-proclaimed security zone it carved out in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when the bulk of its army withdrew from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985, ending a three-year invasion _ The release of all detained Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> `` mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors, from the <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION> detention camp in the security zone and in Israeli jails An estimated 300 detainees are believed held at <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION>. _ An end to what they call <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic missions to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is to travel to the region this week to present a peace plan aimed at ending 10 weeks of rioting by Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The statement accompanying the videotape calls on Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Amal militia to call off its search for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We call on our brethren in <LOCATION> Amal </LOCATION> to understand the dangerous espionage role <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was carrying out, profiting from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer role,'' the statement says. In an earlier statement given to a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper, the group said it was `` lying in wait for any other suspicious American.'' A decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and one-time assistant to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> heads a 76-man observer group attached to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. His abduction has stirred tension between <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which has been challenging <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s dominance in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Amal has rejected the kidnappers' charge that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is a spy, saying in a statement that most abductions by extremist Shiite factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were motivated by a desire to extract ransoms. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Sunday night said, `` We're doing everything we can and exploring every avenue'' to free <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction prompted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s Interim Forces In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, to withdraw 20 observers to its headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Israel-Lebanon </LOCATION> border, said <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>. The rest of the observer group, which is required to be unarmed, remained Sunday in positions overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s green line, which divides the city into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile declared it was working for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' release. In an interview today in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he had given instructions to his colleagues in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to contact the kidnappers. `` In general I can say it was one of the fanatic Lebanese groups'' that was responsible for the abduction, he said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was the third <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official abducted in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in three weeks. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Willian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, both employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that cares for Palestinian refugees, were kidnapped Feb. 5 about 25 miles north of Tyre. There are 22 other foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans, an Irishman, an Italian, an Indian and two unidentified men. The longest held is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Poll Measures Parents's Reaction To AIDS Victims At School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMMAUS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least a fifth of the nation's parents would refuse to send their children to school if a classmate contracted AIDS, according to a survey by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. The poll, conducted for Children magazine, also found more than half of the parents would want to know the identity of young AIDS victims in their community, and all but 6 percent believe schools should educate youngsters about the deadly disease. The pollsters surveyed 411 parents with children 3 to 18 years old between Oct. 23 and Oct. 25. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. According to the poll, 21 percent of parents would keep their children home if a classmate contracted acquired immune defeciency syndrome; 66 percent would allow their youngsters to continue attending classes; and 12 percent were uncertain or would need to weigh the circumstances to decide. Experts with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> insist AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact but through sex, contaminated blood products and tainted hypodermic needles, and infected pregnant women can give it to their fetus. But a few cases, including a child in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s rural <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, have no easily explained source for the virus, which destroys the body's ability to fight infection. `` Scientifically, you could not make the statement that it would be impossible to contact AIDS from casual contact with a classmate,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Lave </PERSON>, a professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Risk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it seems extremely unlikely. We lose kids every year in school bus accidents. We have n't lost any kids from a casual contact with AIDS,'' he said. The survey also found that 56 percent would want to know the identity of AIDS victims enrolled in school, while 39 percent believe the information should remain confidential, as required by federal law. Parents believe the special nature of the disease requires extraordinary steps on the part of school districts. According to the survey, 94 percent of the parents say schools need to educate teachers and students about the disease, even if no one in the district has contracted AIDS. `` I think that's a virtual mandate for schools to get information out for teachers and students to understand,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagay </PERSON>, vice president of the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> organization. Currently, 17 states require AIDS education in public schools. The figures from various parts of the country differ. In the West, 74 percent of the parents would allow their children to attend school with an AIDS victim; in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the figure is 70 percent; and in the East the percentage drops to 60 percent. <PERSON> Kagay </PERSON> believes the concentration of the disease in large cities, particularly on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, accounts for the difference. `` What you are seeing here is the nearness of the threat,'' <PERSON> Kagay </PERSON> said. `` So the stronger the threat or the closer to home, the more reluctant parents may be to send their kids to school.'' Official estimates of the number of children with AIDS vary from 300 to 500, according to the magazine. But Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleske </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> believes up to 3,000 children now carry the virus and half suffer from the disease.

 Official corruption linked to the drug trade is spreading around <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, giving an anxious edge to longstanding predictions the illegal traffic could damage the region's political stability. Because the people who produce and deal in cocaine, marijuana and heroin are so wealthy, the law enforcement agencies entrusted with the fight against them are often outmatched. Indeed, <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> estimates cocaine brings in $ 600 million each year to his nation, compared to $ 500 million for all legal exports combined. In that impoverished South American country alone, about 400,000 farmers, merchants and others depend directly or indirectly on coca leaf farming and cocaine for their livelihood. Allegations that the drug trade is providing funds for candidates has become an issue in this year's election in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. An outburst of drug-related violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has led to calls for the government to be given special powers to combat it. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have for some time been known as notorious centers of drug production and trafficking. But in recent months, cases and allegations of officials playing an integral role in the drug trade have emerged in once overlooked countries _ <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. And after a period of relative calm, drug cases proceeding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judicial system are once again having a major impact on relations between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and many Latin American nations. `` Unfortunately, much the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does these days becomes buried in ideological rhetoric which has nothing whatever to do with the issue at hand,'' said a recent editorial in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, the largest newspaper in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>. Traditionally, the response from governments and observers in the region is to call for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to look more closely at how to control American drug consumers, whose dollars provide the basic incentive for the trade. In a recent editorial, the Mexican government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said the money floated in the drug trade approximates the total amount of debt service payments made by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries each year _ something in the neighborhood of $ 47 billion. `` That figure shows the economic magnitude that the networks of narcotics trafficking have, and the use of planes, ships, weapons and a great deal of money to bribe officials and judicial authorities,'' the editorial said. `` However, the principal problem is the enormous consumption of drugs that exists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that reaches $ 110 billion.'' Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the power behind his country's nominally civilian government, was named in two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indictments Feb. 5 for racketeering and other drug-related charges. Allegations of his involvement in a wide range of illicit activities, including drug trafficking and money laundering, have played a role in protests against his rule that began in June. In retaliation for the steady attacks from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters have called for the ouster of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, headquarters for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activities in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has described as `` isolated cases'' the recent discovery of two cocaine shipments aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aircraft based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, saying they did not appear linked to official corruption in that country. In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the government and armed forces have responded with indignation to newspaper accounts alleging links between the military and drug traffickers. `` I am free of any guilt,'' Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, chief of the Honduran armed forces, said in a telephone interview. `` I will not deceive my own people.'' Haitian Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who runs an army unit known as his country's most brutal, was named by a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> businessman as <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s main cocaine trafficker.

 He did n't win the 6.0 scores that signal an absolutely flawless program. But to figure skater <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON>, his gold medal-winning performance at the Olympics was the ultimate `` 10.'' `` This time, it was perfect,'' the 24-year-old <PERSON> Californian </PERSON> said one day after he defeated friend and rival <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to become the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic gold medalist. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' only other medals have been a bronze in the figure skating pairs and a silver in 1,500 meter speed skating. `` For the first time in my life it looked better than it felt,'' <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON> told a news conference Sunday, after watching a video of his triumphant performance. `` I'm usually so critical of myself that I thought I'd see things I'd done wrong. `` Instead ... it was the first time I could say the jumps were the best I've done and I could say, ` Hey, what a good program.' It's something you build for for years and when it happens ... it's the ultimate. Saturday night's dramatic `` Battle of the Brians'' capped 10 years of skating rivalry that saw <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON> lose the last two meetings, at <ORGANIZATION> Skate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> last fall and at the 1987 World Championships. Each man selected his own military music and battle colors _ blue for <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON>, red for <PERSON> Orser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON>, from the solemn opening notes from <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s `` Napoleon'' to the final seconds when he thrust his fist in the air and wiped away a tear of elation, shone throughout The four-time American titlist was first with five of the nine judges, to <PERSON> Orser </PERSON>'s four. Although they tied in points, the judges gave <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON> the victory on better technical marks. Writing about his future for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON> said: `` It's kind of scary because you know your life is going to change, and you do n't know if you're ready for it or if you want it to change.'' Money, from commercial endorsements or other appearances, was not the reason behind his drive to win the gold, he wrote for today's edition. `` I'm sure I'll do some things with it, but it's not why I treasure it. `` It's going to be different when I go home. It's kind of scary thinking about what it's going to be like when I get back to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, wondering if I'll be able to slip in and out everywhere without being recognized. I worry about privacy, about always being on show. ` Brain <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON> seen drinking a wine,''' he said.

 A British soldier was arrested today after he fatally shot a civilian in the back as the man walked to a football match, the army said. The army said the soldier was in an observation tower Sunday at a permanent military checkpoint a half-mile from the Irish border. From the tower he took a shot at the man, <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>, who was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game in the village of <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. The 23-year-old died on the road before medical aid or a priest could reach him, police said. Police said the soldier was arrested and was being interrogated. Villagers said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority in the British-ruled, Protestant-majority province. The army said it `` deeply regrets'' the incident. It gave no other information and did not identify the soldier. `` It was cold-blooded murder _ I saw <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> shot in the back,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McGonnell </PERSON>, a councilman. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON>, another councilman, said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was an election worker for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, political arm of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fighting British rule. <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON> said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> claimed to have been repeatedly harassed and threatened by the security forces. `` He said he was afraid the security forces would carry out their threats,'' <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON> said. The shooting further strained relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> called immediately for details of the killing. The Irish government, which regards itself as responsible for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority in the north, has been angered by two recent developments. The British Court of Appeal recently upheld the convictions of six Irishmen jailed for life for two bombings that killed 21 people on the British mainland in 1974. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the blasts. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also decided not to prosecute any <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police officers connected with the police shootings of six unarmed Catholics in an alleged `` shoot-to-kill'' policy against guerrilla suspects. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Rescuers struggled in the rain early today to find survivors in the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, where three days of mudslides and flash floods have killed at least 80 people. Mayor <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Saturnino </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> said the mud, water and debris made the city look like `` a giant stepped through'' the area. Officials said the flooding, the worst in the city's history, had rendered homeless at least 11,000 of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s 5.6 million residents, washing ramshackle homes down steep slopes and turning streets into raging torrents. Throughout the city, army trucks and volunteers helped transport evacuated dwellers of precarious hillside shantytowns to temporary shelters in schools, churches and public buildings. Citizens throughout the nation, prompted by all-night appeals on three commercial TV networks, donated truckloads of medicine, food, clothing and building supplies to the victims. Using sledgehammers and chain saws, drenched firefighters worked frantically early today to pull people out of the concrete remains of a three-story, six-apartment building in the <LOCATION> Abolicao </LOCATION> district. The dwelling was hit by a mudslide Sunday night that killed at least 11 inhabitants in an avalanche of concrete and plaster. By Sunday night, 9.6 inches of rain had fallen on the city since Friday, when the flooding began. <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> postponed the post-Carnival reopening of schools and asked private employers to give their workers today off, saying the city could not handle a normal flux of traffic. Health Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Noronha </PERSON> warned there might be an outbreak of leptospirosis, a group of sometimes fatal diseases that can cause fever, vomiting, anemia and bleeding of the skin and mucous membranes. Leptospirosis is best known as <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>'s or Swineherd's disease and is spread from animals to man <PERSON> Noronha </PERSON> told residents to boil drinking water and said the government would vaccinate for typhoid and tetanus. The building that collapsed in <LOCATION> Abolicao </LOCATION> was in a lower-middle-class area. But most victims of the storms were poor people who had lived in shacks built on the city's steep mountainsides. Water, mud and boulders washed many such shacks down the steep slopes and turned streets below into raging torrents and even lagoons. `` I ca n't even imagine what will happen to this city if the rains continue,'' said Vice Mayor <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezende </PERSON>. `` The situation is desperate. We estimate 50,000 people will have to be given new housing in safer areas.'' At the collapsed building in <LOCATION> Abolicao </LOCATION>, rescue workers trudged through knee-deep mud and rubble searching for victims. At least 13 people were rescued. In another district, rescue workers were forced to temporarily abandon their search for elderly patients and hospital staff killed when a mudslide wiped out a three-floor wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genoveva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hillside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>. Although 350 mostly older patients were in the hospital when the slide occurred Saturday, civil defense officials said only about 30 were missing. In the same district <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, an eight-floor apartment building threatened to topple and was evacuated, engineers said. Although the hillside slums that are home to about 2 million people were hardest hit, wealthy areas also suffered serious damage. Evacuations were ordered after flooding hit the wealthy <LOCATION> Gavea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lagoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jardim </PERSON> <PERSON> Botanico </PERSON> districts. Torrents raged down streets, prompting some people to tie their cars to posts to prevent them from being swept away. Civil defense workers used amphibious vehicles and surfboards to reach people in partially submerged cars. Meteorologists said the downpour, caused by an <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> cold front, was likely to continue through today. Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslides around the state and 13,000 were left homeless. The worst-hit area was <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION>, a mountain resort town 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Heart Valve Removed From Brainless Donor Baby, Second On Life
Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A baby born with nearly no brain was on life-support equipment today as a potential organ donor, after a similar infant was taken off life support machinery, officials said. Both newborns, born with the birth defect known as anencephaly, or severely underdeveloped brains, were part of a controversial program at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> preserving brain-dead anencephalic infants for use as organ donors. The practice has drawn fire from right-to-life groups charging cruelty, and from medical ethicists, who say it is questionable to keep the babies on life support when they have no chance at long-term survival. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, born Saturday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was flown to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> that night to be used in the donor program. She arrived just hours after a child identified only as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> was taken off life support when a worldwide search failed to turn up any needy organ recipients matching his tissue type, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. But one of the infant's heart valves was removed and stored for later use, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. Anencephalic babies usually die shortly after birth, and <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, where infant heart transplants have become routine, wants to establish a practice of sustaining such babies so their organs can be transplanted after brain death is certified by two independent physicians. Hospital officials said removal of Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s heart valve was the first use of body parts from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anencephalic infant. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> previously transplanted the heart from an anencephalic baby declared brain-dead in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> was born to <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, 22, and Airman <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, 21, of the <ORGANIZATION> 6993rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Lackland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` Doctors report <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> is resting comfortably, and although there are some signs of brain stem deterioration, she has not yet met all the criteria of brain death,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> is the first hospital in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to develop a medical program allowing the practice of sustaining anencephalic infants for transplants. If brain death does not occur within a week of birth, an anencephalic baby will be removed from its respirator and allowed to die naturally. Several thousand anencephalic babies are born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. Their brain stems can sustain basic functions such as breathing for a short time, but death usually occurs within hours or days of birth. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> has specialized in infant heart transplants, with 13 babies under the age of four months given new hearts at the hospital. Nine have survived. The center, 65 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, became well known in 1984 when Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> unsuccessfully transplanted the heart of a baboon into an infant known as Baby Fae.

<TEXT>
 Six European relief workers who were abducted by rebels in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have been released, a medical aid official said today. Three Irishwomen, two Belgians and a Dutchman were set free after being kidnapped by the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday, said an official of the medical relief group <ORGANIZATION> Medicins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontieres-Belgium </ORGANIZATION>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no details were available and did not specify when the relief workers were freed. Earlier today, <PERSON> Seyoum </PERSON> <PERSON> Musse </PERSON>, head of foreign relations for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office of the rebel group said the six were in good condition. `` The whole aim of taking them with us was to show there are millions of people who are beyond the reach of ... isolated symbolic -LRB- government -RRB- food distribution centers like the one they were stationed at,'' <PERSON> Musse </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The aim is to dispel the government's misinformation that millions are being reached with aid,'' he said, denying that the group's action was an abduction. `` The government will not allow these workers to go outside the place they work. For this reason we have taken them a few hours away,'' he said. `` They are the guests of millions of starved people.'' The rebels abducted two Belgian doctors and a Dutch nurse of the international aid group along with two Irish nuns and an Irish doctor from their base in <LOCATION> Idaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamous </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>, about 340 miles north of the capital <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the medical group reported Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Medicins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontieres </ORGANIZATION> is an international non-governmental organization that has medical aid projects in 15 countries in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the doctors group initially said the relief workers may have been abducted to treat rebel wounded. Fighting in the northern province has been intense between the secessionist rebels and the government of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>. <PERSON> Musse </PERSON> denied that the workers had been taken to treat wounded. `` We have our own doctors,'' he said.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship making its maiden voyage on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> fired warning shots today at a pair of fishing boats that crew members initially believed were attack vessels. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military official, asking not to be identified, said the landing-dock ship <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> took the action `` after it observed two apparent Boghammar-type boats coming toward it,'' about 30 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. He said the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> issued two verbal warnings, which were ignored, and as the boats approached to within 3,300 yards `` it fired a flare and bursts of .50 - caliber machine-gun fire, at which time the craft stopped, then veered off toward the `` A helicopter sent up from the frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> later confirmed through observation that both were fishing boats and neither was hit or damaged,'' the official added. He said the boats at first appeared to resemble the fast, Swedish-built Boghammar Marin boats frequently used by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards to attack commercial ships in the Gulf <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the past have fired warning shots to keep unidentified small boats and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> aircraft from approaching too close to convoys escorted by the navy. The 17,000-ton <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> had just arrived in the gulf hours earlier carrying about 400 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and a contingent of Marine attack helicopters. It was accompanied by the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>, a 39,000-ton oiler chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sealift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> makes periodic trips into the Gulf to pick up fuel oil for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said that because the group included no Kuwaiti tankers or other commercial vessels under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, it would not be counted as a gulf `` transit.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has conducted 35 escorted convoys since last July and the next one is expected to leave <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in the next few days. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gulf operation will get a new commander this week, a 50-year-old career aviator who once headed the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s elite acrobatic jet team. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less, will become commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> in ceremonies Saturday aboard a new flagship, USS Coronado. The <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, native replaces Rear Adm. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>. As commander of the force since July 1986, <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> oversaw last year's buildup that followed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to re-register 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers under the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag to protect them from attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Under <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, the force nearly tripled in size, from about six to 17 warships. It was recently cut back to 16. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been escorting Kuwaiti vessels since last summer. The only mishap occurred during the first convoy when the supertanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> struck a mine, believed laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, on July 24. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has escorted 34 other convoys without a hitch. Iranian ships frequently stop and search vessels they suspect of carrying cargo for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also attacks neutral ships in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil shipping in the gulf. The two nations have been at war for 7 -LCB- years. The last such raid claimed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was last Tuesday, and no ship attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been reported since Feb. 11. Less takes over a command being drastically reshaped for the second time in the past several months. On Feb. 3 he relieved Rear Adm. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a shipboard headquarters created last year to improve coordination between the gulf-based ships and two supporting battle groups in the Arabian Sea. Well-informed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the system failed because of operational conflicts between the gulf and task force commanders. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is a surface unit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law requires any ship with extensive air capability, such as the 16,912-ton <ORGANIZATION> Coronado </ORGANIZATION> and the 15,000-ton <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salle </ORGANIZATION>, which it replaces, to be commanded by an aviator. Less flew A-7 Corsair attack bombers from the carrier Kitty Hawk during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War and in 1973 became the first commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> when the flight demonstration team was formally made a squadron. He served as its commander and flight leader for three years. Less later commanded the oil tanker <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> and the attack carrier Ranger, operating in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Seventh Fleet. Since last August, he had commanded a carrier group and battle group. <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> native, and specialist in aerial electronic surveillance, served five tours aboard the carrier <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.

A guardian and his family who live at the institute were awakened by the blast but not hurt About half an hour later and a mile to the northeast, a second blast hit the ground floor of the Wake-up School, a private nursery school in the lower middle-class <LOCATION> Charonne </LOCATION> district east of the Bastille. No one was at the school. Fires at both locations were rapidly brought under control by firefighters. There was no immediate report of a claim of responsibility for the second explosion, and no indication why the nursery school or the morgue might have been chosen as targets. Police refused to confirm that leaflets, claiming responsibility for the blast, had been found at the morgue. The radio station quoted the leaflets as saying `` although we are not sympathizers of Direct Action, we are against the state as arms dealer and a society that profits from death.'' Direct Action, the best-known extreme left terrorist group in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, was effectively dismantled by a series of arrests last year. The fourth trial this month of Direct Action members opened this afternoon, with seven people charged in the 1983 robberies of a jewelry store and a bank. <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouillan </PERSON>, one of four leaders of the group who have been on a hunger strike for 84 days but kept alive with transfusions, is among the seven defendants.

 Palestinians held memorial services today for the 61 Arabs killed by Israelis troops, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attorney general ruled soldiers could not use force to punish or humiliate protesters. Two Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp Jabaliya, hospital officials said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> city <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian fired in the air after his car was stoned by protesters, an Arab reporter said. The army said it was checking both reports. It also said an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was arrested after trying to stab an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, the third such attack in four days. Leaflets distributed in the occupied territories declared a `` Martyrs' Day'' today and called for demonstrations and a strike this week to protest the visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Army officials said the five-day <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit, scheduled to begin Thursday, might prompt an escalation of violence. `` It's not organized or systematic, but outside events like the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit do affect the situation,'' an army spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said 1,500 additional officers brought in from other areas had been deployed in the holy city to curb <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> violence. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops entered the Arab neighborhood of <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> at the foot of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olives </ORGANIZATION> and cleared away makeshit barricades, while national police went door-to-door checking identifications and looking for agitators. Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> saying soldiers may not use force as a means of punishment or humiliation, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Etty </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON>. Orders that call for such use of force are illegal, ruled <PERSON> Harish </PERSON>, who demanded <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> issue appropriate instructions to the troops. Ms. <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> decided to take action after many Palestinians complained to him about abuse by soldiers. In an army survey, 65 percent of soldiers questioned said they had witnessed rough treatment of Palestinians by troops, said the army's chief psychologist, Col. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON>, on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We do n't have problems with the motivation of soliders ... not that they rejoice to do it, but it's an assignment that has been given to the army and that's how it is seen by the soldiers,'' he said. Since the wave of protests began Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> War, Israelis have killed 61 Palestinians. The latest fatalities were two men shot and killed by soldiers Sunday. The government has spent $ 330 million, or 1 percent of the government's 1988 budget, in an attempt to quell the violence. Palestinians held memorial services Monday to mark Arabs killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. About 1,500 Arabs marched through <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naama </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to mourn the loss of the second village to die in the violence that began Dec. 8. Marchers listened to a series of defiant speeches condemning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation and renamed one of the roads, The Street of the Martyrs of the Uprising. No soldiers appeared, and no violence was reported. In another memorial service today, women marched to a cemetery in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION> to honor three residents who died in clashes with the army earlier this month. A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> car in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, but no one was injured, the army said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp of Jabaliya, soldiers clashed with protesters, and a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh, doctors at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, anti-American slogans painted in red on closed store shutters read: `` No to the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit. Yes to the Palestinian government. Yes to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has ordered Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> not to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, saying he is pro-Israeli and has rejected minimal Palestinian demands. But local <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders said today that they were trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to lift the ban. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials met with several <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives over the weekend to discuss the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit. During his visit, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will present to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative calling for an international forum for direct talks on Palestinian self-rule and negotiations on a final settlement by December. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told European Jewish leaders Sunday night he objected to the hurried pace: `` Any attempt to force the pace and shorten the period -LRB- of self-rule -RRB- would be a detriment to the very essence of the agreement.'' He also indicated he would not give in to pressure to accept the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plan: `` When the time comes for decisions, we shall decide on the basis of what is in our national interests.''

<HEAD>Court To Decide Affirmative Action Issue From Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to study a key affirmative action issue _ the power of local governments to require minority participation in public works projects. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, officials seeking to revive a so-called set-aside program for construction industry businesses owned by minorities. The court previously expressed interest in examining the issue when on Jan. 19 it asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to comment on a construction company's challenge to a set-aside program in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. But the justices stopped short of announcing whether they will hear arguments in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> dispute. In the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> case, the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last September that the city's preferential treatment for minority businesses approved in 1983 is an unconstitutional form of reverse discrimination. The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> plan would require the prime contractor on any city building contract to subcontract at least 30 percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least one-half minority owned. The minorities covered by the plan were blacks, Hispanics, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts. The appeals court, in its 2-1 decision, relied heavily on a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that struck down an affirmative action plan in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> designed to protect from lay-offs minority teachers with less seniority than whites. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in that case said preferential treatment of minorities must be narrowly tailored to avoid hurting whites. The court restricted the power of employers to adopt affirmative action programs when there has not been proof those employers practiced past discrimination. Supporters of local set-aside programs, on the other hand, point to a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may require 10 percent of federal public works contracts be earmarked for minority-controlled businesses. An eventual <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on local set-aside programs would have far-reaching impact. Most states and some 160 local governments have such programs, according to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Education Fund. The 4th Circuit court, in striking down the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> plan, said the city's program was adopted on scant evidence of past discrimination. The appeals court noted that minorities comprise about half of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s population and that minority-owned businesses had received less than 1 percent of the value of the city's public building contracts. But the appeals court said there are few minority-owned businesses in the city area, and there was no evidence they had been victims of past discrimination. `` General population statistics suggest, if anything, more of a political than a remedial basis for the racial preference'' quota in the set-aside program, the 4th Circuit court said. `` There has been no showing that qualified minority contractors who submitted low bids were passed over.'' The appeals court also said the 30 percent quota `` was chosen arbitrarily. The figure simply emerged from the mists.'' `` The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> ordinance reflects the most casual deployment of race in the dispensation of public benefits. It prefers some, and in so doing diminishes the rights of all,'' the appeals court said. A coalition of groups representing local and state governments urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> plan. The coalition said it would reopen old wounds and discourage affirmative action if governments must first show past discrimination before adopting remedial programs. The coalition groups are the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s plan was challenged by the J.A. <ORGANIZATION> Croson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after its bid _ the only one submitted _ to install stainless steel urinals and water closets at the city jail was rejected. City officials refused to award the contract after <PERSON> Croson </PERSON> said there was only one unqualified minority contractor that could help on the project. The company said the cost of the project would rise by $ 7,663 if the minority contractor were used. The city then called for new bids. The case is <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Croson </PERSON>, 87-998.

 <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kienast </PERSON> glare at each other over feet propped on the dining room table and argue the finer points of rock' n' roll music. They both like it, but <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> would n't be caught listening to REM And so it goes with the <LOCATION> Kienast </LOCATION> quintuplets: They are so much alike yet so different. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> turn 18 on Wednesday and hope the day marks the end of media-mobbed birthdays and the beginning of separate lives. `` We've been five all our lives. Now is our chance to be one,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> as her brothers and sisters nod in agreement. `` We want to make a name for ourselves, by ourselves.'' After years of press scrutiny, well-publicized financial problems and the suicide of their father, the quints are a steely bunch and proud of it. They also are distinctly individual. Each plans to attend a different college and four have picked schools far from the spacious farmhouse in this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb where they grew up. `` It's about time,'' <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> said with a grin. `` I've been with them for 18 years. I could make do without seeing their faces every day.'' None plans to tell new friends he or she is a quintuplet. `` Why should we have someone look at us and think of four different people,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON>. The quints say their separation in the fall will be painless because they all live separate lives now. `` We basically have the same friends, but we do n't hang out with the same people,'' said <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>. `` On the weekends, we do n't do things together.'' The siblings say that all that sets them apart from other teen-agers is that there are five of them. `` We have the same fights, you know, that other brothers and sisters have. The girls are always taking my sweaters and stuff,'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> said to the protests of his sisters. The quints gained worldwide attention when they were born Feb. 24, 1970, after their mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kienast </PERSON>, took fertility drugs. At first, many offers of help and endorsement opportunities clothed and fed the children. But financial pressures began a few years later and an anonymous source saved them from eviction by providing more than $ 115,000 to pay off mortgages and property taxes the Kienasts owed. In 1984, the quints' father, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, committed suicide after his plastics business began to falter. At that most difficult time, reporters and photographers camped outside the family's home, making the family angry. `` I really started to resent the media when dad died,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON>. `` There's a limit you can take. `` I understand now,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>. `` They have a job to do and someone sends them out to get a picture and they have paychecks and families, too. But at the time it was too much.'' Despite the unwanted attention, the quintuplets say they appreciated the cards and letters they received from around the world when their father died. They also say they have put his death behind them. `` We could n't dwell on it,'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> said. `` Mom wanted us to get on with our lives.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kienast </PERSON> says she's looking forward to her children leaving home. `` I'm all for parenting and children, but I do n't live through my children. I'm looking forward to this next step,'' she said. `` You're worn out by their senior year.'' The quints' birthdays _ what <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> calls `` press day'' _ have always been met by clicking cameras and a string of interviews. But this year will be different: The quints plan to go their separate ways and celebrate with friends on Wednesday, then hold a private family party on Sunday.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Texas Hospital Withhold Names of Blood Donors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hospital withhold the names of its blood donors from a woman who says her baby daughter contracted AIDS after receiving transfusions. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the donors' privacy rights do not override <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s need to find out their identities in her wrongful-death lawsuit against the hospital Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sued the <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> in 1986, alleging that her daughter, Tristainne, died of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome after receiving blood transfusions in 1983 at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. In pretrial discovery proceedings, Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sought to find out the identities and addresses of all blood donors whose blood had been used in the treatment of her prematurely born daughter. Hospital district officials asked for permisssion to withhold the information, contending that releasing it would violate the donors' privacy rights and threaten the future availability of a volunteer blood supply program. Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is presiding over the state court case, ruled for Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in late 1986, but later blocked any disclosure of the blood donors' identities so the hospital district could appeal. A state appeals court also ruled for Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear the hospital district's appeal last Oct. 7. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the hospital district said it is unclear whether restrictions imposed by the state judge would block Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from asking friends, co-workers and others about intimate and discreet details about the donors' personal lives. `` The parameters of the constitutional right of privacy of blood donors should be considered and defined by this court,'' the hospital district lawyers said. `` A viable national supply of blood and blood products is at stake.'' The case is <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 87-1082.

<HEAD>Army Official Surrenders In '86 Slaying Of Leftist Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An army colonel accused in the 1986 slaying of a leftist leader surrendered to the military today, military sources said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> `` Red'' <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> was placed under house arrest at his residence in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Camp Aquinaldo, home of the Philippine armed forces, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Last week, Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> ordered the arrest of <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> and three other members of a military group known as <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the Nov. 13, 1986, slaying of leftist leader <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON> and his chauffeur. Two of the four remained at large and the other member, navy Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, also is under house arrest at Camp Aguinaldo. A letter purportedly written by <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> and given to Filipino reporters denied he was involved in the slaying of <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON>. `` I am innocent of these charges being leveled against me and I believe this is all part of a grand scheme to discredit all of us who were involved in the February revolution which installed Mrs. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Corazon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as president,'' it said. <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> said because he has been implicated in the <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON> case he has become an enemy of the <LOCATION> Kilusang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uno </LOCATION>, or May First Movement, a leftist labor movement that blames the military for <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON>'s death. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> left his house Monday and started to walk with his wife to a post chapel for a Mass for members of his movement but military police made him return home, his wife said.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Search Warrant Issue in Florida Case</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide when police need court warrants before searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in fenced-in yards. The justices said they will study a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that a helicopter search by sheriff's deputies in <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> four years ago violated the right of privacy. The nation's highest court in 1986 ruled that a warrantless search by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, police in an airplane had not violated privacy rights. In that case, police spotted marijana plants growing in a fenced-in yard while flying at a lawful altitude of 1,000 feet. Voting 5-4 then, the justices said the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which bans unreasonable government searches, `` simply does not require the police traveling in public airways at this altitude -LRB- 1,000 feet -RRB- to obtain a warrant in order to observe what is visible to the naked eye.'' In the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> case, <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies received an anonymous tip that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> was growing marijuana in his yard. Unable to tell what plants were growing in a greenhouse in the yard, the deputies flew over the yard in a helicopter, at an altitude of about 400 feet. From there, they could look into missing panels in the greenhouse roof. Based on what they saw, the deputies obtained a search warrant and entered <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>'s yard, seizing 44 marijuana plants. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> challenged the helicopter search, seeking to block prosecutors from using the marijuana plants as evidence against him. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last July 9 ruled for <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, stating that the helicopter search violated <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>'s reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The state court said the 1986 decision did not authorize `` an unlimited right to any type of examination of residential property from the air.'' The state court added, `` Surveillance by helicopter is particularly likely to unreasonably intrude upon private activities ... because of a helicopter's virtually unlimited maneuverability and observational capabilities.'' It noted that fixed-wing airplanes are not authorized to fly lower than 500 feet in the area where the search occurred. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prosecutors filed the appeal acted on today. The case is <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, 87-764.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Iowa Case on Taxing Oil and Natural Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether states may tax any income from oil and natural gas extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> challenging an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> tax. The state tax is designed to be imposed on that portion of a company's income derived from doing business in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> said it was improper for state officials to include any revenue from offshore gas and oil in determining the company's taxable income <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said the state tax violates a 1953 federal law authorizing exploration and production of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas. The shelf is underwater land more than three miles off the shore of any state. The land is owned by the federal government and leased to private companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the state tax last October. It said the levy `` is in no way dependent upon the exercise of legislative jursidiction on Outer Continental Shelf lands'' that the 1953 federal law was intended to prohibit. Including revenue from <ORGANIZATION> OCS </ORGANIZATION> oil and gas `` apparently aids in obtaining an accurate measure of the tax to be imposed as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> activities,'' the state court said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreed with the ruling of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> court but urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to use <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal to settle the dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers noted that the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> case would be a good one for the high court to use in examining state tax authority because the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> tax takes into account sales both on and off the Outer Continental Shelf. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 87-984.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reconsider its 4-4 decision last December striking down an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law that could have made abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers. The justices, without comment, rejected a request by Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> that they restudy the law `` after the appointment of a ninth justice.'' Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined the court last Thursday, filling an eight-month vacancy. He did not participate in today's order denying reconsideration Despite his 12-year tenure as a federal appeals court judge, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s legal views on abortion are unknown. The high court's decision in December was not accompanied by a written opinion, but merely upheld a ruling that the challenged <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law impermissibly interfered with abortion rights. Such even splits among the justices automatically uphold lower court decisions in the particular cases but set no national precedent. In seeking reconsideration, <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> emphasized the importance of `` a decision by a full court'' in the case. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law required that girls under 18 and still financially dependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hours before having an abortion. The law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if she could prove to a state judge that she was mature enough and well-informed enough to make the decision on her own and that notifying her parents would not be in her best interest. Doctors who failed to comply with the law's requirement faced criminal prosecution. A federal appeals court ruled that the 24-hour waiting period is an impermissible infringement on the right to have an abortion, established by a landmark 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. The appeals court also said the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law provision for parental notification or judicial permission could not be enforced because it did not ensure confidentiality and anonymity for girls who appeal when a judge denies permission for an abortion.

<TEXT>
 A 24-hour transport strike called by leftist guerrillas virtually halted bus and truck traffic today and drastically curtailed use of automobiles. The strike was called by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to protest legislative and municipal elections scheduled for March 20. The rebels say the elections are a farce. No buses circulated in this capital of 1 million people. Thousands of people walked to work, although some pickup trucks jammed with passengers were on the roads. The army said it doubled motorized patrols to provide security for people who defied the strike. The private radio station <ORGANIZATION> YSU </ORGANIZATION> said truck and bus traffic nationwide was about 5 percent of normal. From the western provincial capital of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, the radio reported that the stoppage of buses was total. It said two buses of 50 that normally would have been dispatched left the eastern provincial capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> for other cities. The leftist guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed government since 1979 with a campaign that includes economic sabotage. There were seven guerrilla-imposed transport strikes last year. Three strike violators were killed, about 30 were wounded and some 160 vehicles were destroyed or damaged.

<HEAD>Justices Will Consider Reversing Nevada Basketball Coach's Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said it will consider reversing a victory basketball coach <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> won in his legal battle with the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>. The justices agreed to review a decision barring the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> from suspending <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> as coach at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> for alleged recruiting and other violations. Lower courts also awarded <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> substantial reimbursement for legal expenses. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, who has coached at <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> since 1973 during a highly successful 30-year career, was accused by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 of numerous rule violations. <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> arranged for a student to get a `` B'' grade without attending class, provided free air fare to a student-athlete, encouraged individuals to give the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> false information to impede its probe, falsely certified <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>'s program as being in compliance with <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules and failed to comport with high ethical standards. The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> placed the <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> basketball program on two years' probation in 1977 for recruiting violations and ordered the university to suspend <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> from coaching for two years But <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> obtained a court order blocking the suspension and continued coaching. The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last August that the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> violated <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>'s constitutional rights by failing to afford him due process in its 2 -LCB- - year investigation The state court said the probe was based largely on recollections by investigators of interviews with their sources. Notes of the interviews sometimes were dictated after the fact, the state court said. It also said <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> officials presented signed affidavits by those the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> interviewed in which the witnesses contradicted the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>'s evidence. `` In the circumstances of this case, this procedure does not comport with due process requirements,'' the state court said. The state court also ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization representing nearly 1,000 colleges and universities, acted in the capacity of the state in depriving <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> of his rights. Purely private organizations can not violate anyone's constitutional rights The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> is vested with state power in this case because <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> works for a state school. `` The right to discipline public employees is traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state,'' the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> court said. `` <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> can not escape responsibility for disciplinary action against employees by delegating that duty to a private entity -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.'' A state court judge awarded <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> $ 200,000 in legal fees. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the the sum should be reduced, and ordered further hearings to determine the amount. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> was treated fairly. They also argued that <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> got a `` home court'' advantage by taking his case to a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> state judge who overruled the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> investigators. The judge ruled `` in favor of a popular, local personality'' substituting his views `` for that of 21 independent teachers and administrators who heard all of the evidence,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, 87-1061.

 Flash floods roared through central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today, killing at least 12 people and leaving hundreds of others without homes. Up to 12 inches of rain soaked parts of <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> province during the weekend, washing out roads, bursting dams and flooding huge stretches of farmland, authorities said. Military helicopters plucked 200 people from houses, trees, cars and areas inaccessible by road, the air force reported. Telephone lines were down in many areas, and the city of <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, the capital of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, only could be reached by air, officials said. Rivers in the region have overflowed their banks and many small towns have been evacuated, officials added. Heavy rains were predicted to continue through Tuesday, forecasters said. Officials said the storm killed 12 people and forced several hundred others to flee their homes. <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jager </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said farm damage from the flooding would run into millions of dollars. `` We will start a survey when the weather clears up, but we may take if for granted that crop and livestock losses have been astronomical,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jager </PERSON> said. Heavy flooding last September in the southeastern part of the country left more than 300 people dead and 500,000 homeless.

<HEAD>Court Will Study Illinois Tax on In-State Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to judge the validity of a 5 percent tax <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> imposes on all telephone calls charged to in-state numbers. The court said it will study arguments that the tax interferes impermissibly with interstate commerce. The tax is assessed at a flat rate on all calls, intrastate and interstate, charged to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> service addresses. Two state residents, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McTigue </PERSON>, challenged the law in a class-action lawsuit three years ago in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> joined the case later, seeking to recover taxes already paid. From Sept. 15, 1985, to July 1986, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 2.6 million in taxes under the challenged <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the tax last June 24, reversing a state appeals court ruling that had invalidated it. The appeals court had said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> `` is attempting to tax the entire cost of an interstate act which takes place only partially in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' The appeals court had added, `` This tax ... discriminates against interstate commerce and it is not related to services provided in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is taxing the `` gross charge'' of an entire interstate call `` even though the benefits it affords are limited to that portion of the communication occurring within the state.'' But it said the tax does not unduly burden interstate commerce. The two state residents and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> filed separate <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeals, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> urged the justices as a `` friend of the court'' to strike down the tax. Its brief argued: `` If <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attempted to tax <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on the entire value of its service for all packages picked up in the state, regardless of where they were delivered, that tax would fall before the -LRB- Constitution's -RRB- commerce clause ... Telecommunications companies, whether they are in the telephone, telegraph or electronic data transmission business, provide a service which, for many purposes, is functionally identical.'' The cases are <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> vs. Sweet, 87-826, and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> vs. Sweet, 87-1101.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> official defended the actions of crew members aboard a train that caught fire over the weekend, saying that despite passenger complaints, several lives may have been saved. Passengers aboard <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Zephyr said they received no warnings or instructions from crew members after the fire broke out early Saturday, killing a chef and injuring 19 other people. `` I think our on-board crew's initial instinct was to make sure passengers were n't in any danger from the fire. Then they had to get employees out of the car,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We could have easily had four or five employees killed in that dormitory car yesterday,'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. However, the actions of a conductor and his assistant may have saved several lives, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. Conductor <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Arvada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and assistant conductor <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Witaker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> separated the crew car from the train's baggage car and engine to reach people endangered by the smoke, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said The fire aboard the 14-car westbound train carrying 294 passengers and a crew of 18 was reported about 3 a.m. as the train was pulling into <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> for a scheduled stop. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> Fire Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitera </PERSON> said the blaze was under control about 90 minutes later. Passenger <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> of Fremont said later it was a miracle no one panicked. `` I think the worse thing was that they did n't let anyone in our car know whether we were in danger,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said. `` We could n't find out if our car was safe.'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> investigation was continuing, and that no disciplinary action had been taken against any crew members. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also was investigating. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the fire may have been caused by luggage or some other flammable material placed near a heater in a crew car, contrary to earlier findings by the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshal </ORGANIZATION>'s office that pointed to an electrical short in the heater <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> investigators did n't find evidence of a short, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. State Fire Marshal <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said he would stand by the state report. `` We're fire investigators, and we think we're right,'' <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said Sunday. The victim, identified as chef <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguelles </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, was one of seven crew members on the car, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. County Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderberg </PERSON> said an autopsy showed the chef died of smoke inhalation. Nine crew members and three passengers were treated for smoke inhalation at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. All but two had been released by this morning, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. Those two were in satisfactory condition and were expected to be released today. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the fire probably would prompt <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials to renew their search for an effective smoke alarm for their trains. But no models work now because they are often set off by the constant vibrations of trains, he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Moves Michigan Adult Bookstore Dispute to Federal
Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that forces <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, city officials to justify in federal court a zoning ordinance limiting where adult bookstores may be opened for business. The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments aimed at squelching a lawsuit challenging the ordinance. The ordinance limits the area where adult bookstores may locate to a portion of downtown <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> representing less than 1 percent of the land within the city's 25.3 square miles. Adult bookstores are defined by the ordinance as those where sexually explicit materials comprise more than 20 percent of the stock in trade. So any business establishment, anywhere in the city, may have up to 20 percent of its trade in adult materials. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>, who sought to operate an adult bookstore in an area not zoned for adult entertainment, sued the city. She sought to block enforcement of the zoning ordinance. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> refused to block enforcement, ruling that the ordinance is not impermissibly restrictive. `` The 20 percent requirement provides a beneficial way for decentralization of the adult book business,'' he said. `` By sanctioning the selling of adult books and other books together, the city has eliminated most of the well-known problems of urban blight that result from concentrations of these bookstores without sacrificing its citizens' First Amendment freedoms,'' <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> said. But the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last July 23 that <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> was wrong. `` A city can not arbitrarily limit the exercise of First Amendment rights,'' the appeals court said. `` A limitation of adult materials to 20 percent of a bookseller's wares conditions the constitutional right to speak in one way on the bookseller's willingness to speak in a different way 80 percent of the time. The appeals court sent the case back to <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> for further study after saying it found no evidence `` of a legitimate government objective for the passage of this zoning ordinance.'' In the appeal acted on today, city officials argued, among other things, that the Constitution's First Amendment does not guarantee the existence of adult bookstores if `` the right of access to such materials may be accommodated in other ways.'' The case is <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>, 87-649.

 The military today said a South African pilot was missing after his plane was shot down in southeast <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> during a weekend air raid. The plane was struck by ground fire while attacking <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Angolan government troops during a battle Saturday, the military said. It was the second time during <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s five-month intervention in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that it acknowledged losing one of its warplanes inside the country. The Angolan news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported today that Angolan government troops shot down two South African jetfighters over the weekend and have scored significant gains in recent battles against South African units and the Angolan rebel movement <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> launched two other air attacks Saturday in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> against bases of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, in retaliation for the bombing Friday of a bank in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> The death toll in the bombing reached 20, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> police said today. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also announced that it followed up the air attacks with long-range mortar bombardments Saturday and Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> positions. The military said the mortar attacks were `` successful,'' but did not disclose any details. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> occupies <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, in violation of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution. Its forces regularly enter <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to raid <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> bases. During the Saturday afternoon attack, a plane piloted by Maj. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Every </PERSON> was downed by ground fire, the military said, adding that the air raid was staged because the Angolan-Cuban forces `` posed a potential threat'' to South African troops. The <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> report, monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, identified one of the downed South African pilots as Maj. Every, and said Angolan officials had recovered his personal effects. The report did not specify whether Every was in Angolan custody, and did not identify the pilot of the other plane, both of which were French-made Mirage fighter bombers. In a separate dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported that South African bombing raids caused `` countless deaths'' over the weekend. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> announced in November that its troops were fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to support the <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, rebel movement. However, it is widely believed that South African troops began fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> one month earlier, in October. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting a 12-year <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war for a power-sharing agreement with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, which is backed by Cuban and Soviet forces. President <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said Sunday that 9,000 South African soldiers are deployed in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He also said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has staged 16 air raids so far this year, and that six South African planes have been shot down and 140 of that nation's soldiers have been killed. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has repeatedly refused in recent months to disclose the extent of its military involvement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. However, it has announced the deaths of more than 30 soldiers since November. The military said in November that one of its warplanes had crashed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> while participating in an attack on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> forces and that another plane had been hit but managed to return to a base in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> before crash-landing.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Appeals in Black Lung Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to hear appeals by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and coal mining companies seeking to block the possible award of billions of dollars in black lung disease benefits to thousands of miners. The court said it will review a ruling that the government must reopen some previously rejected claims for benefits. The administration said the ruling by a federal appeals court, if extended nationwide, could force officials to re-examine 94,000 claims at potentially tremendous cost to the overburdened fund that pays benefits to miners afflicted with the disease. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last March ruled that thousands of miners seeking the benefits had been unfairly denied a hearing. The ruling applied to miners with less than 10 years of work in the mines whose claims were denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> must take a fresh look at the claims under liberalized standards adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. The appeals court applied the ruling to miners who failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or who missed deadlines for filing court appeals. The appeals court said miners seeking benefits `` have encountered enormous frustration in the processing of their claims due to administrative delays and determinations under improper standards. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly attempted to ease the burden of proof of disability and to expedite black lung claims.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the ruling would force the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` to embark on a potentially enormous reopening of closed cases that will impose a massive administrative burden. The records for approximately 94,000 claims would have to be retrieved and analyzed'' if the appeals court ruling were to apply nationwide. The 8th Circuit court has jurisdiction in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has created a special fund to pay off claims for miners with black lung disease, also known as pneumonconiosis. Coal mine operators owe the government some $ 3 billion that has been loaned to the fund from the federal treasury. The operators said the 8th Circuit court ruling, if applied nationwide, could burden the industry with $ 13.6 billion in additional payments. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> `` will be required to borrow the money to pay these claims until the coal industry is able to do so, if that day ever comes.'' In another dispute over black lung benefits, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in December made it easier for mining companies to block the award of some disability benefits. That decision upheld a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rule that miners are not entitled to an interim presumption they were disabled by the disease based on a single piece of medical evidence. The cases acted on today are <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Sebben </PERSON>, 87-821, and <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Sebben </PERSON>, 87-827.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today threw out an appeal by seven <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> families who say their religious freedom was violated when their children were exposed to `` godless'' public school textbooks. It also agreed to study a key affirmative action issue _ the power of local governments to require minority participation in public works projects. And it agreed to judge the validity of a federal law creating independent counsels to investigate alleged wrongdoing by high-ranking executive branch officials. It was Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s first day on the court, which was at full strength for the first time since last June 26 when Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> retired. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that requiring the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> children to read the books was constitutional. Today's action essentially ends a widely publicized case some have called Scopes II, a comparison to the furor surrounding the 1925 prosecution of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scopes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for teaching evolution. The controversy began in 1983, when the <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> adopted a new reading list for students in grades 1-8. Pupils initially were allowed to read from other textbooks if they desired, but the school board later eliminated that alternative. All county schoolchildren were required to read the chosen textbooks or leave public school. The seven families who filed the appeal acted on today sued the county school board in late 1983, listing more than 300 objections to the assigned readings. The lawsuit objected on religious grounds to themes or passages in such works as `` The Wizard of Oz'' and `` Cinderella,'' science fiction by <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asminov </PERSON>, fairy tales by <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and stories by anthropologist <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, among others. The lawsuit said the books in dispute violated the families' beliefs by teaching evolution, secular humanism, the occult, feminism and other beliefs, theories or philosophies they consider godless A federal trial judge ruled for the families, finding that their religious freedom had been violated and awarding them $ 50,000 in damages. He ruled that the children should have been allowed to `` opt out'' of the reading program while enjoying the rest of the public school curriculum. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling and threw out the families' lawsuit. `` The only conduct compelled ... was reading and discussing the material ... and hearing other students' interpretation of those materials,'' the appeals court said. `` What is absent from this case is the critical element of compulsion to affirm or deny a religious belief or to engage or refrain from engaging in a practice forbidden or required in the exercise of -LRB- any child's -RRB- religion.'' In seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, lawyers for the families said the case `` presents a classic confrontation between parents and public school officials over the education of children.'' They said children should not be required to read religiously offensive books as a condition of remaining in school. The appeal likened the families' objections to those made by <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses families that sparked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1943 decision striking down a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law that required all public school students to participate in the daily recitings of the pledge of allegiance. The appeal added, `` The rule emerging from -LRB- the 6th Circuit ruling -RRB- is that children can be forced to read books which violate their sincere religious beliefs so long as they are not forced to believe the contents of what they have read.'' Tennessee Attorney General W.J. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> said expressed pleasure at the decision and said `` any alternative disposition would have been the cause of chaos in the school system.'' But <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, attorney for Concerned Women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who represented the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> families, called for the removal of all born-again <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> children from the public school system as a result of the decision. In the affirmative action case, the justices said they will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, officials seeking to revive a so-called set-aside program for construction industry businesses owned by minorities. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last September that the city's preferential treatment for minority businesses approved in 1983 is an unconstitutional form of reverse discrimination. Setting the stage for a major constitutional decision over independent counsels, the justices said they will review an appeals court ruling that the Watergate-era law impermissibly gives presidential powers to the federal courts. The decision, expected by July, will affect the criminal conviction of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and the stalled investigation of <ORGANIZATION> ex-Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. In a separate order, the court rejected Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s latest attempt to block an investigation of his role in the Iran-Contra affair. It let stand a ruling that <PERSON> North </PERSON> may not halt the criminal investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> by challenging its legality in a civil lawsuit. In other action, the court: _ Refused to let a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hospital withhold the names of its blood donors from a woman who says her baby daughter contracted AIDS after receiving transfusions. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the donors' privacy rights do not override <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s need to find out their identities in her wrongful-death lawsuit against the hospital _ Agreed to hear appeals by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and coal mining companies seeking to block the possible award of billions of dollars in Black Lung disease benefits to thousands of miners. The court said it will review a ruling that the government must reopen some previously rejected claims for benefits. _ Let stand a ruling that drastically limits the power of communities to regulate cable television and raises doubts about the constitutionality of a key federal law governing cable operations. The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, turned away an appeal by two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities barred from enforcing public access and other rules challenged by a cable operator. _ Agreed to decide when police need court warrants before searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in fenced-in yards. The justices said they will study a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that a helicopter search by sheriff's deputies in <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> four years ago violated the right of privacy. The textbook case is Mozert vs. <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1100.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today at the White House that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's anti-terrorist policy is worthless because of arms dealing with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In the Midwest Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> taunted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for refusing to compete in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking to reporters after a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting with the president, said, `` I'd have a much tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, referring to the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during secret negotiations to free American hostages, said, `` We'll be living with the consequences of what happened in 1985 for a long time.'' `` You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless. And that's what we did,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Asked about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' statement, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I think it's very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you're talking about specific episodes. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has said repeatedly he supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative but was involved with few details, was campaigning in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, was suggesting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was n't where he should have been. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the next two events on the long road to the 1988 presidential nominations, vote on Tuesday. `` We're ready to do well here tomorrow. We're here to play,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told supporters in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> today. `` I do n't know where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` I did n't find him yesterday in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Could n't find him in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Could n't find him in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Must be somewhere. And these are very important states. Later today we're going to send him a map of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> so at least he gets a little idea where it is.'' Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who also finished first in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, is bidding for a strong showing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s Democratic straw poll to give him a boost as the campaign moves toward the Super Tuesday showdown on March 8 The 4,067 <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses are the first step toward choosing 78 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, while on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side caucus attendees will mark a non-binding straw ballot to express their presidential preference. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s primary, Republican voters will determine allocation of 18 convention delegates, while the Democrats will hold a beauty contest ballot that will not have a binding effect on who gets the state's national convention delegates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, faced with the potential of a repeat of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> results in which Midwesterner <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was a big winner, is concentrating on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> where he hopes to cripple the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's effort. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is a strong favorite in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is shaping up as a three-way fight between <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, winner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Democratic presidential primary, is campaigning hard in both these upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states in an effort to prove he can win support outside his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. After an appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including a session with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to campaign. On his way into the White House for a black-tie dinner Sunday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> quipped, `` I'm just looking the place over, that's all. Asked where he hoped to be next year, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied, `` I hope right here.' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who has made tough action to correct trade imbalances a cornerstone of his campaign, got a blow from his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues when words came out they planned to scuttle his legislation that would impose sanctions on countries that maintain large trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through unfair practices. `` We're going to dump it because it's bad policy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the Trade subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm going to fight for my amendment,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, when told of the plan. Much of the sniping between presidential rivals was being done by long distance. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who made little effort in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and not much more in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> while pursuing a Southern strategy for the Democratic nomination, was interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show `` Meet the Press'' on Sunday and got in jabs at both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. The senator attacked <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for shifting positions. `` It's not a case of just having one or two or three issues where he has changed 180 degrees,'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` There is a long, long list of issues.'' Turning to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the governor has not had `` a single day's experience in foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> quickly retorted that `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building an economy. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in ads running in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> that criticize the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor for not supporting farm legislation sponsored by <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>. The ads also take a shot at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for once suggesting in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that farmers ought to consider diversifying into such crops as Belgian endive. The ads drew retorts from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters in both <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. `` A new low in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> presidential politics,'' said State Sen. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellips </PERSON>, a co-chairman of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> campaign. After his surprising second-place finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was considered a strong contender in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> where caucus organization is once again important. The former evangelist was in <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, on Sunday and told a crowd of about 4,000 at a church dedication that `` the problem facing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not a government problem but a moral problem.''

And I think he's set a tremendous example for all of us of what true repentance is about,'' said congregant <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said the future of his ministry was up to the Lord and officials of his denomination, the Assemblies of God, who reportedly were reviewing photographs purporting to show <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and a prostitute entering and leaving a motel room. Church officials and congregants praised the candor of the evangelist, whose broadcasts reach into more than 100 countries and whose ministry had an income estimated at $ 142 million in 1986. <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies' he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, were `` kind of sick to our stomachs'' over the news of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s problems and added, `` Our heart goes out to them and their family. `` My advice to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> would be do n't do anything for about a month and just pray, and then make decisions. I made a very bad mistake by making decisions too quick,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from his PTL ministry in March and later was defrocked by the Assemblies of God after admitting to a sexual encounter with Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a church secretary. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said she cried when she heard about <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s troubles `` I just felt like I did n't want anyone to suffer the way our family has had to suffer this last year,'' she said Sunday. `` We love him and we're praying for him.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who took over the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry for eight months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left, said: `` I am deeply saddened over this tragedy. With the credibility crisis in recent days involving Wall Street, the world of politics and the arena of religion, many sincere people have had their faith shattered.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the trustee of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> appointed by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It's hard to assess the impact on the so-called electronic church. I'm sure our telephones will tell us tomorrow what they're thinking.'' Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who accepted secret payments from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to cover up her encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, said she expected <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s troubles to affect contributors. `` When they turn on the TV, they're going to see a preacher and wonder if this offering is paying hush money or for a prostitute ... I just feel bad,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said she had heard months ago <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was going to be involved in the current controversy, but when she learned of his public confession, `` I almost fell on the floor.'' `` What shocked me was that he resigned. I feel really bad about this. It hit me. I think that there's too many preachers hanging vendettas over each other,'' she said in a telephone interview from the Playboy mansion where she lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 A forest fire sparked by a hiker's campfire and fanned by 90 mph gusts slowed today after threatening up to 100 houses near <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and a wind-whipped 2,400-acre blaze in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> destroyed at least four houses. No injuries were reported. Roads in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s Sunshine Canyon area were closed late Sunday and occupants of one apartment building near the blaze voluntarily left the building, as did residents of five homes. But no evacuations were ordered and the roads were reopened today. The fire grew to more than 200 acres of grass and light timber by early today, the <ORGANIZATION> Boulder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The area was under a high wind warning with 90 mph gusts reported. Wind had been expected to reach 100 mph today, but at 3 a.m. it subsided to gusts of no more than 30 mph and there was an early morning calm of 6 mph, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The fire has laid down considerably since last night,'' said firefighter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. `` It's not contained in the sense that there is no fire line around the fire completely, but it's not spreading out of control as it was last night when the winds were high.'' Strong wind blew through much of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. Afternoon and evening wind gusted to 65 mph in <LOCATION> Cody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and near <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, chinook wind forced postponement of the final heats of the men's two-man bobsled competition at the Winter Olympics. The Colorado fire started on <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> land in <LOCATION> Sunshine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> and threatened 80 to 100 homes, said sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> `` I do n't know of one that has threatened as many structures as this one,'' he said. Warm, dry and windy conditions existed just before the fire was reported about 5 p.m. Sunday. No buildings had burned by early today, as the fire burned about one-half mile southwest of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. About 100 firefighters battled the blaze. Residents of suburban Sunshine Canyon were asked to be ready to leave their homes in case the fire crossed a ridge into their area, the sheriff's department said. One family evacuated that subdivision Sunday night, and four families in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> did so by today, according to reports from the scene. As flames topped a ridge above one neighborhood, homeowners hooked up garden hoses to spray their roofs and started packing. `` I'm scared to death,'' said ne resident <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Colorado Highway 119 through the fire area was closed overnight between <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> and Nederland, as were two other roads, but they were reopened today. Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said a 30-year-old hiker told police he had started a campfire that apparently caused the blaze. In southwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a grass fire whipped by gusts up to 50 and 70 mph raced across 2,400 acres south of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> and destroyed four houses before being brought under control early today, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Firefighters from at least 10 volunteer fire departments in the rural area northwest of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> battled the blaze, assisted by volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lands </ORGANIZATION> and two mining companies. About two dozen families endangered by the fire were evacuated, but might be able to return to their homes later today, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. Emergency kitchens were set up in two <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> churches to feed homeless and firefighters, and emergency sleeping space was provided at the high school gymnasium and in private homes. The houses that burned were scattered rural residences. The wind `` is as bad as I've ever seen it,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a trapper who lives on the south edge of town. `` The ... stuff was going faster than you could run.'' <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the blaze started Sunday when a cottonwood tree was blown over and severed a <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> line two miles south of <LOCATION> Whitehall </LOCATION>. Flames estimated at 20 to 30 feet high licked the tops of trees along the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire Warden <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said the fire jumped the river. The fire charred an area three miles wide and two miles long, and firefighters said some ranchers cut barbed wire fences to set their cattle, horses and sheep free ahead of the racing flames.

 Fire raced through a ski resort hotel in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> before dawn today, killing six people and injuring 36 others, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said the fire in <LOCATION> Borovets </LOCATION>, a ski resort 22 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, began at 3 a.m. `` Measures were taken to put out the blaze but the building was quickly engulfed in flames,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> report received in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` In the panic that followed, six people died.'' The agency said two of the dead were Dutch, one was Bulgarian and three had not been identified. Of the 36 injured, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said 17 were British, four Soviet, five West German, seven Greek, two Danish and one Dutch, according to <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>. Their names were not released. `` The causes of the fire are still not known,'' the news agency said, adding a commission was appointed to investigate `` the tragic accident.'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> identified the dead Dutch visitors as `` Ms. Ever <PERSON> Vanderberg </PERSON>'' and `` Mr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zekelenburg </PERSON>.'' Their home towns were not made public. The name of the dead Bulgarian was not reported.

Initial reports from Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> said Britons, West Germans and Dutch tourists were injured when they jumped out hotel windows to escape the blaze at the <LOCATION> Moussala </LOCATION> hotel. The diplomats, contacted by telephone from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, spoke on condition of anonymity. Several Western embassies said they had sent diplomats to <PERSON> Borovets </PERSON> to try and learn more about the fire. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has recently made great efforts to encourage Western tourists to visit its mountain resorts on comparatively cheap ski vacations. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, daughter of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, was a recent visitor to <PERSON> Borovets </PERSON>, a picturesque village in the <LOCATION> Rila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>.

 Legislation to replace the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> headed by a single administrator was approved Monday by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today gave their arms control negotiators one month to complete the key provisions of a new treaty to sharply reduce their strategic nuclear weapons. The decision was taken as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> wound up two days of talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He said negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> who have so far failed to make significant progress toward a 50 percent cut in long-range nuclear weapons were directed to report to him and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> March 22-23. In another development, Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> announced the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would begin to withdraw its shorter-range SS-12 missiles from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> late this month as a `` display of goodwill.'' Elimination of the missiles is required under the intermediate-range nuclear weapons treaty President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed in December. The treaty has not yet been ratified in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last week the East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported that troops had begun dismantling SS-12s, based in <LOCATION> Waren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also told a news conference the Soviets indicated they would be more flexible in handling emigration applications, except for those from people who have had access to state secrets. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> confirmed `` categorically'' that only those with information the government considers important to national security would be barred from emigrating, according to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Earlier today, as he opened talks with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pledged to achieve peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and to try to reach a new nuclear arms agreement by spring. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the Sov ... munist Party general secretary smiled broadly as they shook hands and sat down with their aides in opulent <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s Hall in the Kremlin. At a picture-taking session, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Soviets would `` do our best to achieve peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and to have a non-aligned, neutral <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> whici would have good relations with its neighors, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' At the news conference, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he did not have the `` slightest doubt'' that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who came here saying he would seek a specific timetable, gave no evidence he had received one. An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops have been in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since December 1979, backing a pro-Moscow government at war with U.S.-armed Moslem guerrillas. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised to begin a withdrawal on May 15 if the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> can agree on terms of a settlement by March 15. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, met until 1:30 a.m. today with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, then held talks with Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> before meeting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. After the talks, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not say whether the Soviets agreed to support the seven-month <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to impose a worldwide arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for refusing to comply with a U.N.-ordered cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also vehemently denied that he sought Soviet backing for his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. `` I did n't come here with my hat in hand looking for support,'' he said. He said the parties in the region, <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and Israelis, would determine whether his trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> later this week will succeed. The secretary of state has questioned whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can play a bigger role in that region because of its human rights record and its lack of relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On nuclear arms, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` there is still a chance'' of an agreement to reduce by half <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons by the spring. The idea would be to have the pact ready for him and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Dec. 8 to eliminate their intermediate-range missiles, which have a range of about 300 to 3,000 miles. The current negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> concern those with a range above 3,000 miles. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks have been held up because of disagreements over the future of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' anti-missile program and how to verify any new arms treaty. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the negotiators would have until his meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to put together three draft documents dealing with verification procedures, ways to eliminate or convert the weapons and methods to help inspectors observe treaty compliance. On Sunday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> quizzed <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> about human rights, arms control and Soviet reforms and met with a group of Jewish refuseniks to underscore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern for human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to protect human rights, met with reporters after seeing <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has not yet made enough progress to merit holding an international human rights conference. `` As a precondition for such a conference, I see the liberation of all prisoners of conscience, and the complete end of the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a physicist, helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s. He was exiled to the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in January 1980 for speaking out against the Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

 The military said Monday a South African pilot was missing after his plane was shot down in southeast <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> during a raid on Angolan and Cuban forces. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government reported `` violent combat'' in the area and said two of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s French-built Mirage fighters were downed during low-altitude bombing runs Saturday near the garrison town of Cuito Cuanavale. The announcement by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> marked the second time during its five-month intervention in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that it acknowledged losing one of its warplanes inside the country. It has been fighting in support of the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement. Military headquarters said a plane piloted by Maj. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Every </PERSON>, 31, was downed by ground fire during a raid staged because Angolan-Cuban forces `` posed a potential threat'' to South African troops. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> also identified Every by name but did not say whether he was dead or captured. It gave no details about the pilot of the other plane it claimed to have downed. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it launched two other air attacks earlier Saturday in southwest <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> against guerrilla bases of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, in retaliation for the bombing Friday of a bank in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The death toll in the bombing rose by two to 20 Monday, South-West African police said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it followed up the retaliatory air raids with mortar bombardments Saturday and Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> positions. A military statement said the mortar attacks were `` successful,'' but gave no details. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has denied responsibility for the bank bombing. It said Monday that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s retaliatory raids `` hit innocent civilians'' but not SWAPO bases. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> occupies <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, in violation of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution. Its forces regularly enter <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to raid bases of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting since 1966 for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> announced Nov. 11 that its troops had intervened in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war. It is widely believed that South African troops entered <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> weeks earlier. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> _ has been fighting a 12-year <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war for a power-sharing agreement with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government, which is backed by Soviet advisers and 40,000 Cuban troops. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, said Sunday that 9,000 South African soldiers are deployed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> today officially announced his challenge of maverick Republican Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in this year's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, 56, who announced his candidacy for a fourth term earlier this month, has made a name for himself as a liberal Republican, frequently at odds with his party and president. He has championed constitutional issues and civil rights and worked against school prayer and balanced budget amendments. He squeaked into office for a third term in 1982, but says he expects this to be the biggest win of his career. Early polls give him the lead but show <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> in a good position for a challenger. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, 45, a Democratic former state senator who ran unsuccessfully for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, said he'll focus on a single theme between now and November: What has <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> done for <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>? The populist attorney general attacked <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> for using the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as `` a debating society'' for his own agenda, issues that do n't do much for the average person. As attorney general, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> has seized on non-partisan consumer and environmental issues, such as grocery store coupon rip-offs, increased electric rates and dumping sewage into the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The candidates will be determined at state party conventions this summer. So far, <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> is unopposed and <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> has only token opposition from <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who describes himself as a veterans' rights advocate.

 The koala, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s national symbol, could become extinct unless long-term plans are devised to protect its habitat, an expert on the cuddly marsupials warned Monday. `` I am positive that if we do n't take immediate action the koala, our famous ` animal ambassador,' will slowly but surely slide down the inevitable path toward extinction,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Koala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. He told a three-day koala symposium at <ORGANIZATION> Melbourne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> extinction was only a matter of time as urban development erodes the creature's natural habitat. Koalas are found only on the eastern coast of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. They survive on a species of gum leaf and in recent years a venereal infection has devastated koala colonies. It is generally acknowleged that koalas were more prevalent prior to European settlement of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1788, but no figures are available on their number today.

<HEAD>Debris Hurled By High Wind Shatters Windows In Sears Tower
^Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with 90 panes broken.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHIGAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wind gusting to more than 50 mph hurled debris into windows at the Sears Tower early today, damaging 90 panes and forcing police to close streets around the world's tallest building, authorities said. But police said there were no reports of injuries from falling glass. Initially, building officials reported that 19 windows were broken and six others were cracked on the east and southeast sides of the 110-story building, said <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Arms </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose corporate headquarters are in the building. A survey later in the morning by building engineers found that 90 windows were broken or cracked as the wind gusted to 56 mph, he said. `` They're not blown out,'' Arms said. `` What happened is something flying through the air _ like a pebble from the roof of another building _ hit and broke one window and then others were damaged as that one window came down.'' The broken and cracked windows were located between the 50th and 88th floors and are among 16,000 windows in the 1,454-foot tall building. Arms said authorities closed one entrance to the building, leaving two others open. And police Patrolman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Daio </PERSON> said authorities were forced to block traffic during the morning rush hour on the four streets surrounding the building.

<HEAD>Court Will Consider Broadening Protection for Defendants in Ohio
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider broadening protection for criminal defendants who claim they were denied adequate help by lawyers in filing appeals. The court said it will review a ruling that threw out an appeal by an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> man convicted of rape, robbery and assault. The defendant, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>, was convicted of charges stemming from a breaking and entry by three men into a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, home on Aug. 4, 1984. The three intruders sexually assaulted a man and two women, and also robbed the home. After <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> was convicted and sentenced to 18 to 28 years in prison, his attorney refused to file an appeal on grounds there was `` no meritorious issue'' for an appeals court to consider. Lawyers for <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s two convicted co-defendants did appeal their convictions. <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s lawyer then withdrew from representing him and <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> filed his own appeal. An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> appeals court said it was troubled by the conduct of <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s lawyer. But the appeals court said, `` We find -LRB- <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> -RRB- has suffered no prejudice in his counsel's failure to give a more conscientious examination of the record.'' The appeals court upheld <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s conviction. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> public defender's office that was later assigned to the case said in its appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s rights were violated. The public defender said the burden of proving <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> received ineffective legal assistance in pursuing his appeal improperly was placed on the defendant. The public defender argued that <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> should not be required to show specific omissions or errors to establish a presumption he received inadequate representation. <PERSON> Penson </PERSON>'s original lawyer, in refusing to file the appeal, failed the requirement that he state in writing the grounds that arguably could support an appeal, the public defender said. The public defender urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to elaborate on a 1967 ruling that set some standards to judge the effectiveness of lawyers handling appeals. The case is <PERSON> Penson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 87-6116.

 A judge today ordered that the start of Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s trial on criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan be delayed until March 22. Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered the delay from the original March 9 trial date to allow both sides time for handling pretrial motions and answers. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is charged with six counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents in connection with the $ 350,000 campaign loan made in October 1986 by <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer and attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a Feb. 29 impeachment trial by the State <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a May 17 recall election. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said he needed more time to reply to defense motions in the criminal case. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> also complained that attorneys for the Mechams had not yet made required pretrial disclosures, including lists of witnesses and exhibits. The governor's lawyers were given until March 7 to file a motion seeking return of the charges to the grand jury for a new finding that enough evidence existed to support the charges. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> today also scheduled a March 2 hearing on several motions that were filed last week by <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, and joined today by defense attorney <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> on behalf of the governor.

<HEAD>Robertson, Super Tuesday's Unknown Factor, Seen Winning Some
States</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders in both political parties, trying to assay the hard-to-measure strength of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, say they expect he'll win some Southern Republican presidential primaries on Super Tuesday, come in second in others and pick up a substantial share of the 700 delegates up for grabs that day Interviews by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporters in the 16 states holding <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries or caucuses on March 8 underscore that the former television evangelist is a wild card, his strength unfathomable but clearly formidable. `` We've got seven phone lines and they're jammed with calls these days,'' says <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>. `` People are asking questions you just do n't hear a lot _ how is a precinct organized, how is a person registered. It leads me to believe they -LRB- <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters -RRB- are active across the state.'' Says <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>'s Democratic counterpart, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecke </PERSON>: `` I think he's scared the established <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to death.'' Because many evangelical Christians, the core of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s support, have not participated in the nominating process in the past, his strength in competition with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is hard to gauge A new question mark is whether the weekend confession of moral waywardness of another television evangelist, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, could have any fallout on <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who made his fame preaching before the TV cameras. `` I think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s biggest competition in the South will come from <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>,'' says political scientist <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not inconceivable that he could beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in some of these states.'' Political observers report that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> appears weak in the three non-Southern <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries _ <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> chairman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, which holds caucuses March 8, says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> are so closely clumped that a prediction is impossible. `` I would n't be a bit surprised to see a 30 percent <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> turnout in the delegate selection, with the other candidates splitting the rest,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> says. Says <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> state chairman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>: `` We're not just going to take it, we're going to sweep it.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which holds its primary on March 5, three days before Super Tuesday, could be an early indicator of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s strength Observers say a strong <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> showing there could give him a big boost throughout the South. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> claims he is ready to pull a stunner in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Republican primaries or caucuses will be held on Super Tuesday in 12 Southern states _ <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Nearly a third of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,277 convention delegates will be selected on Super Tuesday. `` I think <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is going to do pretty well,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> campaign manager for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A worker at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headquarters, speaking on condition she not be quoted by name, goes further: `` <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is the one we are really worried about.'' <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Kip </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>, trying to assess <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s support, says: `` Remember the Right to Life march a couple of weekends ago? It was raining and it was a Saturday morning and it was freezing. There were over 3,000 people who turned out. That's <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> predicts <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will win the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> primary: `` I think its his.'' `` <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will probably come in second in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ if he does n't come in first,'' says <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> GOP chairman emeritus <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. `` You do n't know how many people are out there in the invisible army and how many will come out to vote. But they're committed with a burning zeal. In precinct meetings 16 days ago, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> won a plurality of delegates to the county conventions which will be held in the 10 largest counties in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Only counties with populations over 80,000 held the meetings. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s support ranged from a low of 35 percent in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> -RRB- to a high of 96 percent in <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Next door in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, political director of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, sees no prospect of a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> win. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is shaping up to be a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> race,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said last week in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is seen as a factor behind <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> registration jumps in many states. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> state director <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, citing a 6 percent jump in Republican registration since October, says, `` We feel like we were responsible for 90 to 95 percent of them.'' `` You take <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a very conservative, Bible-Belt area which had a 16 percent increase in -LRB- Republican -RRB- registration from May to October,'' observes <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, political director for the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` You got to feel, if you put two and two together, that a lot of that is <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state chairman in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, says of the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> strength: `` Essentially it's still limited to the religious conservatives. I do n't see him breaking out beyond that very narrow base, except in spotty cases, here and there.''

 The new managers of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> plan no hirings, firings or changes in service for at least two months while they study the company's future, the wire service's new president said today `` Everything is frozen'' during the study period, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> said in a news conference. The new management team has not decided on what course to follow with the financially ailing company. While <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> would not deal in specifics, he said he believes that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s news executives `` want two wire services'' but he said he still needs to talk with people in the news industry because he and others want <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> to become `` a market-driven company.'' The management and a team of 15 experts will interview the staff and media executives, assess the company's financial situation and look at options for the next four to six weeks. At that time they hope to have a business plan detailing the company's future. <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> works for <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a media investment group whose chairman is Dr. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> recently formed WNW, a holding company, to take control of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> publisher <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said WNW purchased control of <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>'s stock for 10 years in <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> for a `` substantial cash payment,'' but he would not say how much. The announcement was made late Friday. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, 45, is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm with at least partial interest in 22 companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a cable TV service. The companies are mostly in the area of information or venture capital. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> served as secretary of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was governor and went to the 1976 Republican National Convention as a delegate in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s unsuccessful bid to defeat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> In 1974, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that revitalizing <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> under American ownership was an important personal goal. He added, however, that his conservative views would not influence news coverage. `` This thing to me is just a little deeper than an issue of turning another company around,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said. `` As a conservative Republican, as far as I'm concerned, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> is an extremely important asset to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Giving the wire service new emphasis in such areas as financial news and sports scores, using new technologies for delivery, are being considered, he said. Referring to his business interests in those areas, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said, `` We believe that a lot of this stuff can be done directly by <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> itself.'' To finance continuing losses at <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said he will ask private investors to put up money. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>, who paid $ 41 million to acquire <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> from Chapter 11 proceedings in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June 1986, reportedly lost a million dollars a month on <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> said they hoped to improve <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing capabilities, and that <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s presence would help. The new managers will be `` doing it all in English,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said, a reference to <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>'s inability to speak English. Meantime, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s executive editor, said that `` morale is soaring'' at <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> since the new managers took over. One of the reasons <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> could not purchase <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> outright was an agreement that <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> giving the union the right of first refusal to buy <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>. The new <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> managers plan to meet later today with the <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, guild negotiator and spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said the union `` wants to see <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> remain an integrated, quality, competitive general international news service.'' A proxy represents a transfer of voting power represented by the ownership shares, but not the shares themselves.

<TEXT>
 Fifty book-lovers spent their third straight day holed up inside a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> public library Monday to protest the library's planned closure. They passed the time reading and talking. `` Libraries are vital to civilized life,'' said protest organizer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charterton </PERSON>, 62, a marketing consultant. Supporters in the street below the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pancras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> used a rope to hoist food supplies up to the protesters. `` We are sleeping on the floor and bringing food up through a window ... as we have been told if we leave we can not get back in,'' <PERSON> Charterton </PERSON> said. The sit-in began Saturday and is scheduled to continue until Tuesday, when <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> borough councilors are due to meet. The borough blames government-demanded budget cuts for the library's closure.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's long and sometimes bumpy road to filling a vacant seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> came to an anti-climactic end on Monday, Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s first day on the bench. The four hours of subdued technical arguments in the hushed, crimson-draped courtroom were a sharp contrast to the noisy and partisan battles that preceded <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s Feb. 3 confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> looked solemn as he entered the chamber, strode past the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, stood before the pale marble columns and took his seat at the end of the row of nine justices. That seat, on the far right as spectators face the court, is the traditional place for the high court's newest member. A slight smile crossed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s face during a brief exchange with Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, seated next to him, just before Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> opened the session. The former appellate judge from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a man with a reputation for being deliberative and well prepared, did n't say a word until nearly an hour had elapsed. And then he asked only one question. The first argument of the four on Monday's schedule concerned the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s attempt to undertake its own cost review of the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nuclear plant near <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> listened intently and took notes during the hour of technical discussion. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, the two most recent additions to the court before <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, were among the most aggressive questioners in the first argument. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> waited until its closing minutes to ask his first question from the bench of the high court. `` Is it fair to say,'' he asked attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON>, representing the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, `` that all of the arguments that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> wants to present now ... could have been made before <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION>, even though <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> is being asked to draw a different conclusion?'' <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON> said no, but <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s question was answered in the affirmative by <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the former solicitor general, today representing <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light. `` These matters can and must be raised before <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> if they are to be raised at all,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. The next three cases involved railroad worker lawsuits against employers, a technicality concerning sex discrimination in state pension benefits and a surgeon suing fellow doctors over antitrust violations. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s presence brought the court to full strength for the first time since Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> resigned in June. And it marked a return to business as usual following months of conflict between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intensely scrutinized and ultimately rejected Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, the administration's first nominee. Its second nominee, Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, withdrew after revelations that he had used marijuana. Although a conservative for 12 years on the federal bench, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is considered more moderate than either <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> or <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. But little is known about his views on abortion regulation, affirmative action, church-state relations or the other politically sensitive issues on which the court is closely divided.

<TEXT>
 Women students on both sides of the abortion issue are uneasily sharing the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>'s Center this semester after the university overrode the center's decision to exclude opponents of abortion. `` We've been meeting there once a week,'' said senior <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> Students for Life. `` It's not entirely welcoming, but it's getting much better. ... There was lots of anger, bitter feelings.'' <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>'s group, which has about 10 members, asked the student coordinating committee of the Women's Center for permission to meet there last semester. The committee said no, largely because of differences over abortion. The Women's Center, in the basement of a campus building, provides meeting space for several organizations including the staff of the student feminist magazine <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> and a lesbian group. `` The pro-life stand made people uncomfortable,'' said <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Margenau </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> senior and a coordinating committee member. `` It was a very unique situation with the Women's Center. We've never had any groups who were supportive of pro-life opinions try to come in.'' When the coordinating committee rejected <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>'s group, she said she viewed it as discrimination. `` We asked if they were violating the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> freedom of expression policy,'' <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> said. `` The center is called the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> Women's Center and there's no denying the fact that we were all <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> women I would have no argument if they called themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> pro-abortion center.'' She added, `` There is a whole pressure here to be ` PC,' to be politically correct. ... Part of being PC is being pro-abortion.'' The anti-abortion group took the matter to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s administration, and both sides met with <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, associate dean of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, the dean of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, made the final decision, <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margenau </PERSON> said. An assistant to <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> referred questions to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who said the dispute `` had to do with freedom of expression and not with one's personal political views.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said that as a result of the dispute, the dean's office decided to spell out who was eligible to use the women's center: groups primarily composed of undergraduate women and concerned with women's issues. <PERSON> Margenau </PERSON> said she now agrees with <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s decision that the center is <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> property and should therefore be neutral, but the <ORGANIZATION> Womens </ORGANIZATION>' Center coordinating committee saw another issue take shape with his decision. `` We, the five coordinators, learned how little power we really have when it comes to a man's decision. ... The main problem was realizing who really had the power, and it was <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, and it was kind of a blow,'' <PERSON> Margenau </PERSON> said. Countered <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>: `` All the associate deans are women, and we were all in on the decision, and we thought it an excellent one.''

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said Monday a videotape by Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in which he repeated the demands of his captors in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has no validity because it was made under duress. `` All statements made by hostages are made under duress,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, echoing a similar comment by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> noted that the demands, including an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from its border security zone in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, are the same as those announced last Friday by the Organization of the Opporessed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, one of two groups which claim to have kidnaped <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. She also disputed a statement by <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, sister of the longest-held American hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, that the administration is displaying a double standard by working hardest to free captives seized most recently. `` We all can understand and sympathize with her anguish and her frustration and her sorrow over her brother's continuing captivity,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` We're making our efforts on behalf of all the hostages. Our goal is not the release of this one or that one but rather the safe return of all the hostages.'' Mrs. Say's brother, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. Mrs. Say contended that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been less vigorous in seeking out her brother than <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a onetime top aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> videotape had been viewed by members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and White House staff but he did not believe President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had seen it. `` We continue to call for the immediate and safe release of Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> as well as other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We are not going to give in to the demands of terrorists. We will continue to pursue all avenues for his release.'' Asked if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had any reaction, the spokesman said, `` You know the president's deep convictions about Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and all the hostages, but we want to avoid saying anything that could exacerbate the situation.''

<HEAD>Scholar Who Helped Unravel Dead Sea Scrolls Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allegro </PERSON>, renowned for his work in deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls but ridiculed for his theories that Western religions were based on the worship of mushrooms, has died. He was 65. <PERSON> Allegro </PERSON> died at his home on Feb. 17, his birthday, according to death notices and obituaries published Monday. No cause of death was given. He is to be cremated Tuesday. Allegro was a brilliant student of Semitic languages at <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and went on to study Hebrew dialects at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In 1953, he was named to an international team formed to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in caves at <LOCATION> Qumran </LOCATION> on the shores of the Dead Sea six years earlier. The scrolls, which spanned from about 100 B.C. to 70 A.D., included the oldest known manuscripts of books from the Old Testament. Allegro's gift for deciphering minute texts was crucial. His book, `` The Dead Sea Scrolls,'' was published in 1956 and became a bestseller. Allegro's subsequent notoriety caused derision in the scientific community but developed a cult following in the early 1970s. Allegro, in his 1970 book `` The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,'' contended that <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> and Christianity were in fact products of an ancient sex-and-mushroom cult. He theorized that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>'s last words on the cross were not a lament to God but `` a paean of praise to the god of the mushroom.'' Although trained for the Methodist ministry, he became a fervent anti-Christian devoted to debunking the story of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. Allegro also published a 1966 book, `` Search in the Desert,'' about an unsuccessful search for lost scrolls in the <LOCATION> Judean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. He is survived by a son and a daughter.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that drastically limits the power of communities to regulate cable television and raises doubts about the constitutionality of a key federal law governing cable operations. The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, turned away an appeal by two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities barred from enforcing public access and other rules challenged by a cable operator. The court's action, which appears to have been based on narrow procedural grounds, leaves open the possibility of a subsequent appeal. The dispute was between officials of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atherton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the cable operator. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> ruled last September that cable regulations adopted by the cities unconstitutionally violated <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION>'s free-speech rights. He threw out regulations that required Century Federal: _ To provide public access channels for those not connected with the cable company _ To wire the entire community to make service available to all residents _ To use a `` state-of-the-art'' system to keep pace with the latest technological advances The judge, who previously had ordered city officials to award an operating license to Century Federal, called for further hearings to study franchise fee requirements adopted by the cities. Palo Alto and <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON> officials said the ruling appears to declare unconstitutional a 1984 federal law regulating cable TV, even though the judge did not say in so many words he was invalidating the law. Although <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> `` purported not to decide the constitutionality of any provision of the act, -LRB- his -RRB- decision in fact holds that numerous sections of that statute are unconstitutional,'' lawyers for the cities said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in a `` friend-of-the-court'' legal brief filed by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, urged the court to deny the cities' appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a 1986 ruling that has some bearing on the case acted on today, raised the possibility that communities may be barred from granting exclusive cable TV franchises. The court said cable franchise activities `` plainly implicate First Amendment interests.'' But the justices stopped short of a definitive ruling on the constitutional rights of cable operators. The ruling was in contrast to earlier decisions denying a constitutional right to operate over-the-air television or radio stations. Many cities award exclusive cable franchises city-wide or for various regions within the city. They also impose rules similar to those adopted by <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON>. The case is <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> vs. Century Federal, 87-946.

<HEAD>Parents Say Students Should Wear Identification Badges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some parents of students at a school where three faculty members were shot want students to wear identification badges and be subject to random searches with hand-held metal detectors. `` We're feeling as though some of -LRB- the school's -RRB- rules and regulations need to be looked at,'' said <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> <PERSON> Villafana </PERSON>, whose daughter attends <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we can not have these metal detectors, then we can have doors that lock from the outside.'' About 50 parents met Sunday night to discuss ways to prevent further violence at the school. They plan to submit their ideas to the <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> during its regular meeting Wednesday. School officials were not invited to Sunday's meeting, but representatives from the school's Parent-Teacher-Student Association were on hand. On Feb. 11 two administrators and one student teacher were wounded in an altercation with two students. Assistant Principal <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> died of his injuries Wednesday. At the meeting, one woman favored providing the school resource officer _ a <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> police officer assigned to the school _ with a hand-held metal detector. The officer should make random searches, she said. `` Does n't have to be a reason. Just stop them and run them up and down,'' she said. Principal <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Heminger </PERSON> declined to comment specifically on any of the group's suggestions. She said she was glad to hear the meeting was positive, `` and I hope that from -LRB- the meeting -RRB- come some good things that we can work with.'' One of the two students accused in the shootings had recently been suspended for cursing a teacher. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Leotti </PERSON>, organizer of Sunday night's meeting, told parents that other school systems she surveyed around the country send students to counselors before suspending them. She will suggest Wednesday that <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> institute a similar policy. `` We want suspensions, but we want counseling,'' Ms. <PERSON> Villafana </PERSON> said. `` And we do n't mean guidance counselors, we mean psychologists.'' If a student uses profanity when expressing frustration to a teacher, he should n't be suspended, she said. Among the other suggestions: providing counseling for teachers and students; having a substitute resource officer when the regular officer is out; providing new carpeting to replace one with bloodstains; having a crisis-intervention team; and having a parent volunteer force patrolling hallways.

 <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Debo </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> by covered wagon and became known as `` The First Lady of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> History </LOCATION>,'' has died at age 98.

 The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> secretary of state's office is threatening to sue the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> to get back 1,600 cartons of memorabilia left behind by former Gov. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an official said Monday. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who served two terms ending in 1982, gave the letters, memos, videotapes, pamphlets and personal correspondence to <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> 5 -LCB- years ago. The collection includes about 4 million items. But Secretary of State March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON> contends his action violates a 1975 amendment to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Public Records Act. The amendment declares gubernatorial and legislative papers `` public records,'' although <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> lobbyist, former state Controller <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> <PERSON> Flournoy </PERSON>, claims that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s papers fall under an exception for `` personal correspondence'' and memos from the governor's legal affairs secretary On Jan. 20, Mrs. <PERSON> Eu </PERSON>'s office sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> threatening to sue. <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> received the letter in early February, and a suit will be filed within 30 days after that unless the matter is resolved, Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has indicated he chose <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> as repository for the documents after the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> turned them down because of lack of space and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> balked at the former governor's insistence that the agency hire former <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> to oversee the collection. <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> but insists that she won the job in an open competition. Mrs. <PERSON> Eu </PERSON>, who as secretary of state also heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, argues that the all documents should be in the archives. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, left records from his eight years as governor to UC <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>.

 The University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> chancellor on Monday rejected calls to excuse students from classes or work so they could take part in a moratorium to consider racial tensions at the 25,000-student university. `` The university administration joins the Undergraduate Student <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the wide majority of students on the campus, in standing against the moratorium on classes planned by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said the school considered gaining social awareness part of education, but, `` We expect students to attend class and to gain social awareness through class.'' `` Participating in the boycott will not excuse students from responsibility for meeting their academic obligations,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said. The moratorium, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, was urged by students last week following settlement of a six-day occupation of a university building by minority students seeking harsher treatment of people involved in racist behavior on campus. About 300 students marched to <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s office on Friday to urge him to sanction the moratorium.

<TEXT>
 A pre-dawn fire Monday destroyed a Bulgarian ski-resort hotel that caters to foreign tourists, killing six people and injuring 36, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> reported. A Western diplomat said a Dutch woman was killed when she jumped from a window to escape the flames. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said those injured in the fire at <LOCATION> Borovets </LOCATION>, 22 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, were from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. It said two of the dead were Dutch, one was Bulgarian and three had not been identified. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has made great efforts recently to attract Western tourists to its modern mountain resorts for relatively inexpensive ski vacations. <PERSON> Borovets </PERSON> is bidding for the 1989 Alpine skiing world championships. Throughout the day, most information on the blaze at the Moussala Hotel came from Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, the capital, and two British tour companies. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> did not issue its first full report until nearly 15 hours after the fire started. `` Measures were taken to put out the blaze but the building was quickly engulfed in flames,'' the <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` In the panic that followed, six people died.'' `` The causes of the fire are still not known,'' it said, and a `` special commission has been appointed to investigate.'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> added: `` The necessary medical aid has been provided to the injured and the rest of the tourists have been accommodated in other hotels.'' A man who answered the telephone at the state tourist office in <LOCATION> Borovets </LOCATION>, and would not give his name, said the 193-bed Alpine-style hotel was completely destroyed. Reports said most victims were being treated in local clinics, but a Dutch diplomat said two injured citizens of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> were taken to <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> because there was no more room at the clinics. The Global Ski tour organization in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> had 32 customers booked at the hotel, and said a representative in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> acted as interpreter to help police interview the injured and others.

<HEAD>US Says Sandinista Delay in Talks ``Extremely Unfortunate''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was `` extremely unfortunate'' that Nicaraguan government cease-fire negotiators did not respond quickly enough to a new truce proposal to prevent the talks from breaking down. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> also welcomed what she said was the unconditional acceptance of the proposal by the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels. The plan had been outlined by the chief mediator, Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, during talks last week in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The positive attitude of the Contras `` further indication of the resistance's willingness to negotiate in good faith and of their desire to achieve a cease-fire,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She added that the Sandinista government's delay in responding to the proposal apparantly led to <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s decision to break off the talks a day early. The cleric's proposal called for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to free all political prisoners, allow complete freedom of expression and resume a dialogue with opposition parties, among other measures. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government has said the cease-fire discussions should be limited to the technical aspects of achieving a truce and that political questions should be dealt with separately. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s decision to suspend the talks caught the Sandinista negotiators by surprise. They said they had been ready to accept his plan in principle and to continue the discussions.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship, arriving in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Monday as the newest addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s escort squadron, fired machine-gun warning shots to chase away two fishing boats that ventured too close. Although the craft proved to be harmless, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, the boats at first appeared to be <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Whaler-type vessels, often used by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards to attack commercial shipping. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> fired after the boats approached within 3,300 yards of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoy, 30 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, at about 3 p.m. He said, `` <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> ... issued two verbal warnings which were not heeded, and when the boats came within 3,000 meters, it fired a flare and bursts of .50 - caliber machine-gun fire, at which time the craft stopped and then moved off to the northeast A helicopter sent up by the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, accompanying the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, `` confirmed through observation that both were fishing boats, and neither was hit or damaged,'' he added. While no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship has been directly attacked by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, several have fired warning shots when unidentified small boats approached too close or ignored verbal cautions. In one such incident last year, an Indian fisherman was killed by gunfire from a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate. American ships also have fired warning shots or come close to firing missiles at <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes flying too close during attack sorties against Iranian coastal oil shipping. A delegation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials is visiting <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to discuss the problem with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military leaders. The 17,000-ton <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> sailed through the Strait of Hormuz hours earlier to join the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s flotilla in the gulf. It carried a 400-man <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> combat unit and a contingent of Marine attack helicopters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the group was not considered one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s gulf `` transits'' as it did not include any of the Kuwaiti tankers reflagged by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year for protection from Iranian attack. The <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, one of the ships involved in a current realignment of navy units in the region, is a replacement. When the reshuffling is completed, probably within a week, it will leave the gulf-based force at 16 ships, including six mine sweepers, down one from its maximum strength of 17. Next Saturday, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less will take over command of the gulf force from Rear Adm. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the Marines aboard the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> would provide security for naval operations in the gulf, where the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iraq-Iran war has seriously affected commercial shipping <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency said a prototype of the `` first Iranian-made airplane'' made a successful test flight Monday and would soon go into mass production. It said the `` multiple-purpose'' aircraft can be adapted for military use, and all parts were made in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by experts affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards corps. Each plane will `` save $ 500,000 in foreign exchange,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also announced that at the orders of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 1,139 prisoners have been released as part of an amnesty to mark the ninth anniversary of the Islamic revolution. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the detainees released in various cities in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were `` repentant'' and had been pardoned.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will judge the validity of a federal law that lets independent counsels investigate alleged crimes by high-ranking executive branch officials. The court also rejected the latest appeal of one target of such an investigation _ Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The court's decision, expected by July, will resolve a major constitutional dispute and will affect the criminal conviction of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and the rejuvenated investigation of <ORGANIZATION> ex-Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. The decision also could affect other investigations by special prosecutors appointed under the law. The justices allowed special prosecutor <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> to resume her investigation of <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, raising the possibility that grand jury indictments could be handed down before the high court's ruling A federal appeals court ruled that the Watergate-era law creating independent counsels impermissibly gives presidential appointment powers to the federal courts. The appeals court had derailed <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s investigation. A three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled, by a 2-1 vote last month, that the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 were an unconstitutional encroachment of the exclusive power of the president to enforce criminal laws. Under the law, a special court appoints independent counsels, or special prosecutors, at the request of the attorney general to investigate alleged criminal wrongdoing. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> is investigating allegations that <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a former assistant attorney general, lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 during a dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup program for toxic waste. The appeals court ruling followed a challenge by <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> and others to <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s authority to subpoena their testimony before a federal grand jury. The Jan. 22 ruling could jeopardize last month's perjury conviction of former presidential aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> for lying to a grand jury and to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities. But the appeals court ruling in <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s case is not expected to interfere with the work of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra arms and money affair. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month refused to consider <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s challenge to the parallel appointment <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> accepted last year from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> North was fired as a White House aide after his role in the diversion of money from secret Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels was revealed. A different three-judge panel of the appeals court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> upheld the constitutionality of the backup appointments last year. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who is prosecuting former presidential aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> on illegal lobbying charges, also accepted a backup appointment. But <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, the independent counsel who prosecuted <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, did not accept backup appointments. The North appeal acted on Monday was from a ruling that barred him from halting <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation by challenging its legality in a civil lawsuit. The appeals court ruling that dismissed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawsuit said, `` Potential criminal defendants can not, by bringing ancillary equitable proceedings, circumvent federal criminal procedure.''

 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> derided President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-terrorism policies on Monday as worthless in light of the Iran-Contra affair, prompting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman to retort that candidates should n't make a hostage situation a political issue. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, using the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as a backdrop after a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, issued a stinging critique of the administration's Iran-Contra involvement and the problems it might pose for the next president. Asked how he would respond to the latest hostage-taking, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless. And that's what we did.'' Referring to the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during secret negotiations to free American hostages, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We'll be living with the consequences of what happened for a long time.'' His remarks came as the administration struggled to deal with the kidnapping of another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a Marine detailed to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce-monitoring force. Queried by reporters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would have `` a much tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy'' than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` What happened in 1985 was devastating ... to our ability to be credible when it came to putting together a very tough, no-compromise policy on terrorism,'' he said. `` This is international crime, pure and simple, and you fight it the way you fight crime _ with tough police work, with effective undercover operations, with military operations against terrorist base camps if necessary,'' the governor added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remarks brought a quick rebuke from presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` I think it's very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you're talking about specific episodes,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman asserted that past experience has shown that `` there are any number of aspects to individual hostage-takings that can be exacerbated by political talk or media talk or political statements.'' `` I would simply urge caution on everyone's part, including political candidates,'' he said. Besides hitting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s performance on terrorism, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor took advantage of the attention of the White House press corps to question <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach to welfare reform and child care. On a strictly political topic, he also said he was heading into Tuesday's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> contests aiming to prove he has wider appeal than shown by his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary victory. `` If I can do well out there, that will be proof positive this is a national campaign, and a national candidacy,'' he said, adding that he hoped victories there would be a boost for the multiple showdowns March 8 on Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> joked that he'd used the governors' visit to look the White House over as a possible residence. `` No commuting, do n't even have to take the street car, just walk to work _ it's terrific,'' he said with a broad As dozens of camera and microphone-toting technicians and correspondents crowded around him on the White House lawn, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even offered to `` meet with the press two or three times a week'' if he were elected. And to reporters' delight, he dangled the option of Hawaiian winter vacations before the oft-traveling pack. It would be tough to top <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>,'' one correspondent taunted when the subject came up, noting the lush <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> resort town near <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vacation ranch. `` How about <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> _ what do you think?'' asked the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor with a grin. Mild murmurs of approval were made. Then, a query about his winter vacation plans. `` The Berkshires,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied firmly, only to be met by silence. Sensing a need to offer a new slant on the subject, the candidate quickly shifted gears. `` On the other hand, my wife expressed a preference for <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> the other day,'' he offered. Cheers erupted from the crowd.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan was delayed by a judge Monday until March 22. The delay from the original March 9 trial date gives both sides time to handle pretrial motions and answers, said Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a May 17 recall election and a Feb. 29 impeachment trial by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> he needed more time to reply to defense motions. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> also complained that attorneys for the Mechams had not yet made required pretrial disclosures, including lists of witnesses and exhibits. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said the Mechams' lawyers made `` more or less a grandstand play'' by saying in court Monday that they were ready to go to trial when they had not made the disclosures. The governor's lawyer, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said those disclosures would be made this week. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he would schedule a hearing later on several defense motions to remand the charges to the state grand jury, dismiss some of the counts and require grand jurors and the prosecutor to submit to questioning. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, has claimed in court papers that Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office manipulated the grand jury process by having most testimony presented to a state grand jury that met last fall, but holding the matter over for a new grand jury which indicted the Mechams on Jan. 5. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office has contended, however, that the matter was given to a new grand jury to avoid possible bias because three members of the previous grand jury had signed petitions to recall <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> that he was prepared to have both the criminal and impeachment trials simultaneously although he indicated he may ask a court to delay the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s impeachment trial. However, he did not say when or where he would file such a motion.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffin </PERSON> had hoped for an anonymous vacation in the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but on her first day there, throngs of Chinese ran up to her shouting, `` nightmare, nightmare.'' `` It's funny now, but it was n't funny then,'' the actress said recently. `` At first I thought it was because of my blonde hair and obvious Western looks. Then I started to think that maybe I was somebody's idea of a nightmare.'' What actually caused the commotion was the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people recognizing her from the 1976 film, `` Nightmare in <LOCATION> Badham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' in which she played a hitchhiker hounded by a lecherous sheriff. It was a major box office hit in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. That visit six years ago began a love affair between Miss <PERSON> Raffin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and she continued to return, recently to film the $ 20 million miniseries, `` <ORGANIZATION> Noble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' airing this week on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. She plays a tough corporate officer who falls for the head of a trading house, played by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON>. `` I had been to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> about a dozen times before the filming and took the role as an excuse to go back,'' Miss <PERSON> Raffin </PERSON> said. `` I feel very comfortable there. It's like the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, so colorful and romantic with a tremendous energy level.

<TEXT>
 A deadly mix of rock and mud threatened hillside homes during a fourth day of violent rains Monday which have killed at least 75 people in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> area. The new danger slowed efforts to reach a buried roomful of children and prompted the mayor to order hundreds of residents to `` get out while there's still time.'' Mud-caked survivors flashed thumbs-up signs as they were carted away on stretchers, while rescuers moved gingerly about the unstable hillsides in the city. Scores have died there since the heavy rains began triggering sporadic floods and mudslides on Friday. Civil defense officials warned that huge boulders and rain-loosened earth on many hillsides presented an extreme risk of new avalanches, particularly in the crowded shantytown slums that line the hills. Mayor <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Saturnino </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> went on television to order hundreds of slum dwellers to evacuate their high-risk homes. `` Get out while there's still time. You may lose your possessions, and we regret that. But we're talking about your lives,'' <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> said. In the working-class north <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Abolicao </LOCATION>, rescue workers used sledgehammers and spikes to break up concrete slabs of a three-story apartment building that collapsed under a mudslide Sunday night, killing at least nine residents. Fourteen people were taken alive from the rubble. Television crews broadcasting live from the site showed survivors covered with yellow-brown mud flashing thumbs-up signs as they were borne away on stretchers. Civil defense spokeswoman <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadid </PERSON> said workers expected to find as many as 11 bodies under the rubble. `` There was a children's party going on in one of the apartments when it collapsed, so we do n't know how many were in there,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hadid </PERSON> said by telephone. In the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teresa </LOCATION> district near downtown <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, 80 firemen searched for bodies under the debris of a hillside clinic for the elderly that was hit by a mud avalanche late Friday. A three-story pavillion of the clinic collapsed and at least 11 patients died. Rescue efforts were slowed by rain and by a warning from engineers that a new mudslide could occur at any moment in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teresa </LOCATION>. `` They have to work carefully, using blowtorches and sledges, removing the metal, concrete and wood. When it starts to rain, they stop. Otherwise the whole hillside could come down,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hadid </PERSON> said. The spokeswoman said the death toll of 75 included only bodies that had reached the morgue and `` the final total certainly will be higher.'' The number of dead varied almost daily as civil defense authorities struggled to get a clear picture of the tragedy's human toll. Nearly 9,500 were without homes, a drop from previous days because some flood victims began moving back to their dwellings. State health officials began a massive vaccination campaign against tetanus and leptospirosis, a sometimes fatal infection caused by water contaminated with rat urine and droppings. Earlier reports indicated erroneously that leprosy was feared. Public service messages on radio and television urged people not to walk barefoot through flood water and to boil their drinking water or treat it with chlorine. <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> declared a state of public calamity in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> and estimated the damage at $ 150 million. The weather bureau said the unusually heavy rain was caused by an antarctic cold front. The forecast was for more rain and gradual clearing by Wednesday. Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslides around the state and 13,000 were left homeless.

 Professional politicians do a better job of selecting qualified presidential nominees than the current year-long system of primary elections, former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> says. Tower added that televised presidential debates are no better than `` East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hog-calling contests.''

In the past, he said, `` The smoke-filled room screened out the candidates who were least competent.'' Tower, a Republican, said today's system can result in a nominee who has the best commercials and who articulates his ideas best, but who may not be the best president. He also criticized the news media, saying, `` I do n't think the mass media are capable. You do n't get a balanced assessment from sensational press stories. The mass media have become too strong.

 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Moral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s problems will likely have a negative impact on the Republican presidential campaign of former television preacher <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nims </PERSON>, president of the conservative lobbying group, said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s tearful confession and his stepping down from his own TV ministry Sunday will not affect <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s core of supporters. However, the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> controversy might change the minds of supporters who had been leaning toward the Republican hopeful. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> -RRB- has a large base of support'' that would n't be affected by the fall of a televangelist, <PERSON> Nims </PERSON> told a news conference called by a group of conservative organizations on another subject. `` But it might have an impact outside,'' he said.

<HEAD>Expulsion is Only Appropriate Sanction for Biaggi, Committee Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s violation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics constituted `` criminal conduct of a most serious nature going to the heart of his representational responsibilities'' and warranted expulsion, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Monday. The committee, which recommended Thursday that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, be expelled from the seat he has held for 20 years, explained why it had elected to exercise its most serious punishment. `` The facts and circumstances giving rise to the violations, being of the most serious nature, warrant the imposition of the most stringent sanction available to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>,'' the 148-page report said. `` Accordingly, the committee submits that expulsion is the only sanction appropriate to the violations committed by Representative <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was not in his office Monday, but he said Thursday that he intended to vigorously fight the expulsion recommendation. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 70, was convicted in September of illegally accepting a paid <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation from <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Democratic leader. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> was seeking government help for Coastal Dry Dock and <ORGANIZATION> Repair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a financially troubled <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> shipyard that owed $ 280,000 in premiums to <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s insurance brokerage firm. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was also convicted of illegally crossing state lines to accept the gratuity and obstructing justice by trying to influence how <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> answered the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s questions. He was sentenced to 2 -LCB- years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine, and is free pending appeal. The ethics committee concluded that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> violated rules against discrediting the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>; accepting impermissible gifts from a person or organization with a direct or indirect interest in legislation; failing to report a gift worth $ 250 or more on his financial disclosure form; and accepting a favor or benefit that might be construed as influencing the performance of government duties. After reviewing evidence from <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s trial, the committee `` found that the offenses for which Representative <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted involved criminal conduct of a most serious nature going to the heart of his representational responsibilities.'' The committee's resolution to expel <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> must be approved by two-thirds of the 435-member House to take effect. The matter may be taken up on the floor at any time, now that the committee report has been released. If the resolution passes, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> would be the second congressman expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> since the Civil War. Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> `` Ozzie'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, D-Pa., was ousted in 1980 after his conviction in the Abscam bribery scheme The committee report also includes a transcript of its closed Dec. 17, 1987, meeting, at which <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> pleaded for leniency and declared, `` I am incorruptible.'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> argued that the vacation he took, at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> health spa, was `` hospitality'' from <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, a friend of 40 years, not a gratuity. Placing the value of the vacation at about $ 3,000, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> asked rhetorically, `` <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> is going to compromise himself for $ 3,000? I would n't compromise myself for $ 100,000.'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> also said he did not know that <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> had business with Coastal until a bugged telephone conversation on June 2, 1986, more than a year after the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation.

<HEAD>Nine-Member Court Will Hear Second Round of Arguments in Two Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At full strength with the addition of Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it wants to hear a second round of arguments in two cases already under study. The unusual move _ having lawyers twice argue a case before the justices during one court term _ could mean that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s tie-breaking vote is needed to resolve the two cases At issue in one is whether defense contractors may be forced to pay damages for on-duty accidents involving members of the military. The court is deciding whether to reinstate a $ 725,000 award to the family of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter co-pilot who died in a 1980 crash in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. A jury awarded the damages to the family of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who drowned on April 27, 1983, in the crash of the CH-53 helicopter But the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> threw out the award against the helicopter manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON>, as a military contractor, was shielded from being sued because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> approved of the helicopter's allegedly negligent design. The justices heard arguments in the case Jan. 12. The second case, which the court first heard Jan. 19 and will be reargued sometime in April, involves the convicted killer of an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> policeman. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> shot <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, Police Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahan </PERSON> three times after the officer arrived at a motel being robbed by <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> on Jan. 5, 1983. At issue is whether <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' trial was tainted when the presiding judge refused to disqualify `` for cause'' a potential juror who said he would vote to impose the death penalty _ and would not even consider a life sentence _ if <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> were convicted. The potential juror was excluded when <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' lawyer used one of nine `` peremptory challenges.'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> contends his defense team should not have been forced to expend one such challenge for that juror. Both cases are to be decided by July. The court Monday refused to reconsider its 4-4 decision last December striking down an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law that could have made abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers. The justices rejected a request by Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> that they restudy the law `` after the appointment of a ninth justice.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined the court last Thursday, filling an eight-month vacancy, but he did not participate in Monday's order denying reconsideration in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case. He did join in the orders requiring reargument in the two other cases. In seeking reconsideration, <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> emphasized the importance of `` a decision by a full court'' in the case. The Illinois law required girls under 18 and still financially dependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hours before having an abortion. The law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if she could prove to a state judge that she was mature enough and well-informed enough to make the decision on her own and that notifying her parents would not be in her best interest. Doctors who failed to comply with the law's requirement faced criminal prosecution.

 Five people were killed and five others were injured in a flurry of weekend gang-related shootings despite a police sweep aimed at curbing street violence. Sixty officers swept through gang-infested south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> during a special 16-hour campaign against gang members and drug dealers Saturday and Sunday. They arrested more than 50 people for crimes ranging from narcotics sales to concealed weapons to grand theft auto, said Lt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Leap </PERSON>. Despite the show of force, the violence was unrelenting. In one of the weekend killings, a man was shot by three teen-agers on bicycles, said <PERSON> Sheriff </PERSON>'s Deputy <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. In one especially flagrant gang shooting, four men in a car shouted gang slogans and opened fire on about 50 people gathered in front of a <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> restaurant Sunday, police said. Four teen-agers were wounded. The escalating street gang problem in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> became evident last month when it stretched out of crime-ridden south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and reached into upscale <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, where a 27-year-old woman died when she got caught in gang crossfire.

 A teen-age boy whose father hired a hit man through Soldier of Fortune magazine to kill his mother fought back tears Monday as he testified he feared a similar fate. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, 18, took the stand in the second week of a federal court trial of a lawsuit filed by him and his maternal grandmother, <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Einmann </PERSON>. They are seeking $ 22.5 million from the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, Colo.-based magazine, accusing the self-proclaimed `` Journal for Professional Adventurers'' of negligence for running an ad that led to the slaying of <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. The ad, placed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, brought him into contact with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. Black is on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' death row for paying <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> $ 10,000 to carry out the killing of his wife. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> is serving three life terms in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for that and two other slayings. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a high school senior who found his mother shot to death in their <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> home three years ago Sunday, described her as understanding and kind. `` She just was the worst person I could lose,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Einmann </PERSON>, who also testified Monday as plaintiffs completed their case against the magazine, said her grandson was so devastated by the killing he not sleep alone or enter his house alone for a year and a half afterward.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> resigned today, saying he is `` unable to support'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s decision to abandon the goal of a 600-ship fleet and criticizing <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s leadership in the Pentagon. `` This building needs to be led,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> told reporters. `` It needs leadership. It needs some vision. I'm saying that if I had a piece of advice to give to Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, it would be to spend a lot more time with the top leaders in this building. `` He's been spending a lot of time with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a lot of time on the Hill. I think they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> leaders -RRB- need to feel his vision and to understand what he believes in.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 42, has held the job less than a year. A highly-decorated Marine veteran of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat, he was the author of `` Fields of Fire,'' a best-selling novel about the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. In his letter of resignation to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said he decided to leave because he could not support the fiscal 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget proposal crafted by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to accommodate budgetary reductions. Secretary <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints, but I know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the country, and will work with Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to find a replacement as soon as possible.'' Referring to the internal budget debate that led to last week's submission of the fiscal 1989 budget, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: `` On three separate occasions, the uniformed and civilian leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> provided the secretary of defense with proposed cuts totaling the amount required to meet the budget reduction, but which also would preserve the cherished goal of your administration to rebuild our <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to a minimum of 600 ships. Because those recommendations `` were rejected by your secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, I am unable to support him personally or to defend this amended budget during budget deliberations -LRB- on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> concluded. `` Consequently, I find it necessary to resign from my position as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` This -LRB- budget cutting -RRB- is not being done according to a strategy,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> told reporters in his Pentagon office. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who assumed the post as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top civilian leader just April 10, said his concerns focused on a decision by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to propose the early retirement and mothballing of 16 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigates. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had to cut $ 12 billion from its original fiscal 1989 budget plan, but still could have kept those ships by assigning them to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> instead of consigning them to mothballs, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> continued. Without those frigates, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said there was no way the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could build to 600 warships in fiscal 1989, as originally planned. Indeed, despite the optimistic predictions of other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, the decision means the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will never reach the 600-ship mark, he added. `` And one of the sad things about this, this was one of the few goals of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that was really obtainable, at pretty low cost,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, one of the youngest men to ever become <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary, is a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduate. He came to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 when <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, assuming the post of assistant defense secretary for reserve affairs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had resigned that position and was preparing to leave government service in early 1987 when the president asked him to replace <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, the first <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. In his meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> declined to speculate on why <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had insisted that ships be retired when that step _ in <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s view _ was n't required. Pentagon leaders should always be concerned about `` hollow forces'' that are n't properly manned, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could have reached the 600-ship mark without giving up readiness, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> insisted. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary said he had wrestled with his concerns for some time but did n't make a final decision to resign until Sunday. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said he had not spoken to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> today, but had sent him a copy of his letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in a written personal statement, said today he had learned of <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s decision `` with regret.'' `` I wish him well in his future endeavors,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` He has earned our respect and gratitude for his service to our nation both in uniform and as a civilian leader within the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Pentagon, in a companion statement, said the recent budget debate `` has been one of the most painful in history.'' `` The compromises have not been easy for anyone, and we regret the fact that the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> appears to have found himself unable to defend the department's decisions. Under the circumstances, he has done the honorable thing.''

 The 70-year-old reputed underboss of the Gambino crime family was sentenced Monday to 15 years in prison and fined $ 820,000 for a racketeering conviction. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Armone </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was convicted Dec. 22 of racketeering conspiracy involving extortion, bribery and illegal interstate travel to commit bribery. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said he sentenced <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> to prison despite his advanced age because he was convinced <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> was a high-ranking member of the crime family. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> also cited <PERSON> Armone </PERSON>'s lengthy criminal record, which he said began when the defendant was 15 years old. Armone had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for the most serious charge, racketeering. According to the prosecution, <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> was elevated from capo to underboss after he was indicted in 1986. It was also alleged that <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> was observed meeting with reputed Gambino boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> during the trial. Armone was jailed at the time of his conviction after he refused to renounce any organized crime ties as a condition for his release from detention. On Monday, <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> made a brief statement to <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> in which he said he had not meant any disrespect to the court in refusing the offer but that he turned it down because he was worried about `` his rights'' Prior to sentencing, defense attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasnow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> had `` paid his dues to society'' for his previous convictions and charged that his client had been entrapped by the government. Prosecutor <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Grover </PERSON>, a special attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> had been convicted of `` serious and compelling'' crimes and of being a leader in the <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family. his life,'' <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> said. One of the bribery charges accused <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> and one of his co-defendants, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, of unsuccessfully plotting to give a $ 20,000 bribe so that <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s son would be transferred from a state prison, where he was then being held, to a federal prison, where presumably he would receive better treatment.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Winds gusting up to 56 mph blasted gravel and other debris into the world's tallest building Monday, and 90 of the Sears Tower's windows cracked or shattered, officials said. There were no reports of injuries from falling glass, said police and officials of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has its corporate headquarters in the building. Police cordononed off the streets surrounding the 110-story building during the working rush hour, and planned to keep one closed as a precaution throughout the day. `` There are people in the process of boarding up windows and removing cracked windows,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The windows, 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall, began shattering and cracking at about 3:30 a.m. when gusts of up to 56 mph were recorded in the area, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Arms </PERSON>, another spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and Arms said it appeared that one or more windows was broken by debris, perhaps pebbles from nearby roofs, and the others were broken as pieces came down. However, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, `` We do n't really know _ it happened in the dark.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said company officials did not have a damage estimate. All the cracked or broken windows were located between the 50th and 88th floors of the 1,454-foot building, said Arms. Five windows were broken during high winds in April 1984, he said.

<HEAD>Priest Says Shooting Victim Was Harassed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former parish priest of an Irish nationalist who was shot dead from a British army observation tower said Monday the victim was harassed by police and soldiers for at least five years. The Rev. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>, 23, had to cross into the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> every day to his job and was harassed constantly at the army checkpoint. `` We complained time out of number to the police and military, but no action was ever taken. Life for the poor man had just become unbearable,'' <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> told reporters. The army said it `` deeply regrets'' the shooting Sunday. A spokesman said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was hit by a bullet fired from an observation post about half a mile from the frontier in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. Police said the soldier involved was in military custody and an investigation was being conducted. The soldier was not identified and police would not comment on the priest's allegations. Relatives said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was walking to a regular weekly Gaelic football game in <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION> village where he lives. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON>, a local councilman, said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was an election worker for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, legal political arm of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> denied he was among its members and <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, the priest, said he was not involved in paramilitary activity. `` He was never abused physically, just verbally, and his car was often taken apart,'' he said. `` I do n't know why he was singled out for such treatment. `` The campaign against him must have been going on for at least five years. Other young lads were also stopped, but <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> appeared to be getting special treatment.'' Shootings of civilians by security forces have become rare compared with the early 1970s, when Protestant-Catholic strife in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province was at its height. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s death came at a time of severe strain in Anglo-Irish relations over other incidents involving police and the province's Roman Catholic minority The government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> demanded a speedy report. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> provoked Irish outrage last month by saying it would not prosecute policemen accused of perverting justice in the aftermath of the killings of six unarmed Catholics in three incidents in late 1982. The strain was compounded by a British appeals court's refusal to overturn the conviction of six Irishmen for two bombings that killed 21 people in 1974. Irish officials believe the six are victims of a miscarriage of justice.

 A federal judge Monday dismissed drug-related charges against a woman whose boyfriend fell to his death from a plane in 1985 with 77 pounds of cocaine and a defective parachute strapped to his body. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> dropped the counts at the request of Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON>, who last week lost a bid to use statements mad by <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> to undercover agents as evidence against her. Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, 32, a paralegal in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, had been set to go on trial March 1 on charges of conspiring with her boyfriend, former <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> narcotics officer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, to import cocaine and of distributing the drug. Under the terms of the dismissal, <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON> can seek another indictment against Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. Meanwhile, her attorney said Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> was pleased at the movie and hopeful the case was over. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>'s body was found on a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> driveway Sept. 11, 1985. Bags of cocaine were tied to his waist, and federal authorities have linked him to about 200 pounds of the drug found in duffel bags scattered across northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> for apparent later retrieval.

 Nine organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, announced formation Monday of a coalition to lobby on behalf of children with AIDS. `` We need money from both government and private sources,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, a member of the academy of pediatrics. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> noted that about 80 percent of the known 839 cases of children with AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were born to mothers who are drug abusers themselves or sexual partners of drug abusers. `` If we could reach these prospective parents today, we could stop this expanding problem in nine months,'' he said at a press conference. But he acknowledged that drug abusers are the hardest group to educate about the threat of AIDS and said more money will be needed to pay for the kind of face-to-face contact that is required to reach them. Rather than focus on a particular goal, representatives of the nine organizations said they would engage in a `` generic'' effort to make sure children are not forgotten as programs to combat AIDS are formulated and implemented.

On the eve of the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> precinct caucuses and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was offering a new scenario for survival of his financially troubled campaign. `` I have to say candidly it is unlikely I am going to win in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I think we're going to do respectably. I think we're going to do respectably on Super Tuesday and then the whole thing, in a sense, starts over because I think we're going to have a very scattered result after that.'' He noted that the next big event after March 8, the day dubbed Super Tuesday because 20 states will hold primaries or caucuses, will be the primary in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, his home state. `` I think we're going to have a new ballgame,'' he said.

But he acknowledged <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was to the left of himself when he was asked about how they have differed on such issues as military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and money for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nuclear defense shield program. `` I have a hope that I can educate him a little bit, and bring him over a little bit more,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> opposes military aid to the Contras, while saying he would support some humanitarian aid, and has opposed money for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, although he has said he would support some research consistent with existing treaties. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had a rating of 70 in 1986 from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, meaning his votes on selected issues agreed with that group's position 70 percent of the time. He had a rating of 9 from the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, by contrast, had ratings of 25 from the <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION> and 65 from the <ORGANIZATION> ACU </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said he regarded <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> as the most electable of the Democratic candidates and `` strong on national defense.'' `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is the only <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate in this race who can carry the South in November,'' he said. `` His roots run deep in Southern soil, and he has never forgotten rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from whence he came,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> renewed the criticism of his rivals, accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of suggesting it was `` fine with him if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> established a client state in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, so long as they did not put Soviet offensive weapons in that client state.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has sharply denied making such a statement. `` It is another example of his total lack of experience in foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> repeated criticism of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for changing positions on issues such as abortion, the minimum wage and taxes. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> acknowledged he had voted in 1984 for legislation that had mandatory production control provisions similar to the farm proposals <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> now backs and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> denounces as disastrous for the economy. `` There is a difference between changing your mind on one or two issues over a 12-year period, and having a wholesale change in dozens and dozens of key positions,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. He also said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s `` whole approach to the electorate is in contrast to the approach during his career in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also campaigned in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, one of the 20 states holding <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries or caucuses March 8, where he said stopping the flow of illegal drugs into the country would be a top priority for his administration. He stopped at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Curtis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> shipyard, which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has scheduled to close and which he pledged to keep open.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to ratify a treaty with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that he said should help the two countries prosecute terrorists, drug traffickers and other criminals. The Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters was signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> at their meeting in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, on March 18, 1985. The White House said submission was delayed while annexes to the pact were worked out by the two nations. It is one of a series of such legal assistance treaties being negotiated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Similar pacts have gone into force with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

In his message to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he said the treaty with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> `` should be an effective tool to prosecute a wide variety of modern criminals including members of drug cartels, ` white-collar criminals' and terrorists.'' The treaty provides for the two countries to assist each other in taking testimony or statements of witnesses; providing documents, records and evidence; executing requests for searches and seizures and serving documents. It also provides for assistance in proceedings relating to forfeiture of the proceeds of crime, restitution for victims and collection of fines.

<TEXT>
 This seaside town is girding for another successful spring break, while former mecca <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> faces defections to exotic resorts and uncertainty at home over whether it should keep encouraging college students. The 1960 film `` Where The Boys Are'' established <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> as the nation's spring break center, but <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> has taken the lead in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> recently. <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> will play host this year to about 500,000 young vacationers between Feb. 28 and April 1, while <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> may be lucky to attract the 200,000 that came last year, officials say. Not all of the defectors are going to <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. In recent years, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' South <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the Mexican resorts in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> have cultivated the free-spending students. `` I doubt if I have 100 reservations to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, but probably 8,000 for <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of Travel Turf Tours in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> last week. `` There's some talk about how <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s coming into prominence,'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tourism division spokesman <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcucci </PERSON> said Monday. `` It started happening last year.'' But with 16,000 hotel rooms along 23 miles of beach, <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is expecting a strong turnout. `` We know that, on an average, each student visiting <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> spends between $ 325 and $ 400 here,'' said <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` Assuming each dollar is spent seven times in the local economy, my guess is we're looking at about $ 130 million this year.'' <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> networks </ORGANIZATION> will broadcast live from <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> over the peak March 20 weekend. Two breweries are sponsoring free concerts, a soft drink maker is sending a portable dance club to motel parking lots, and countless other national distributors will promote everything from suntan lotion to peppermint schnapps, including tennis shoes and do-it-yourself pregnancy tests. Tour promoters say <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> has become the spring break mecca partly because <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> officials, weary of the trouble that came with the collegians, have been cracking down. `` In the past five years, I've seen a gradual increase to <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>, just because of the strictness of the enforcement in <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Campus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ellyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` You can really kind of let loose in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>; it's a little bit wilder.'' <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police jailed 270 people when an all-night, rock-throwing melee broke out on the strip in 1975. But <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> ran into even more trouble. A crackdown two years ago resulted in 2,500 arrests. Across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, state officials this year are urging bar owners to obey the law on the drinking age of 21. The Division of <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverages </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> is presenting workshops in traditional spring break cities to educate bar owners and employees about <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s drinking laws. Meanwhile, `` For sale'' signs have been sprouting in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` Last year was a devastating year for a lot of the small hotels, and some of these mom-and-pop hotels already are being listed for sale,'' said real estate broker <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastiani </PERSON>. While city officials emphasize family vacations, some merchants are still rooting for the college students. `` There's only a small group that does n't want the college students,'' said `` Crazy <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, former bar owner and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> '88 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> promoting spring break. `` And they do n't seem to be directly involved with beach business.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s presidential campaign manager said Monday the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator intends to take the offensive on the issue of taxes and may `` start pointing out how many times <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has changed his position'' on the subject. Former Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> also accused the vice president's campaign of deliberate distortions of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s position that were `` demeaning to the political process. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> made his comments as aides said the campaign had hired new producers for its television advertisements in the wake of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s defeat by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in last week's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary Officials said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON>, who produced a biographical videotape used late last year to introduce <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to the voters, would be joining the campaign. They will replace <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was seen as damaged in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charge that he could n't be relied on to block tax increases, but <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said the vice president really distorted the record. He said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has said he would veto any attempt to increase income tax rates, but was not averse to closing certain loopholes that allow corporations to reduce their tax bills. He said it was time to `` start pointing out how many times <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has changed his position on taxes. Back in October he said he was against any tax increase, a few days later he came out and said well maybe. In November again he said, well I really do n't want to and then four days after that he said maybe we'll have to. `` I do n't think we're going to be on the defensive on this one. I think we're going to be on the offensive,'' he said. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> did not elaborate on the comments he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had made.

 Scandals surrounding two of the most prominent ministers of the Assemblies of God may have created a false impression that the church is riddled with discipline problems, an official said Monday. The evangelical church, which counts more than 16 million adherents worldwide and operates four colleges in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, is investigating the misconduct of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. Officials say <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has revealed an undisclosed transgression. On Sunday, he tearfully stepped down from his television pulpit. Another prominent television evangelist, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, lost his Assemblies of God credentials last year amid charges of sexual misconduct. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was said to have been active in uncovering that scandal and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> accused him of plotting to take over <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. ` Those are the only two in our whole denomination that have that kind of recognition,'' said church spokeswoman <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>. `` So people may feel that this is indicative of the Assemblies of God denomination, and that is not true. `` We have over 30,000 credentialed ministers in the Assemblies of God in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At any given time, any given year, fewer than one-half of 1 percent are ever called into discipline ....'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said 12 areas of misconduct, ranging from doctrinal aberrations to moral failure, call for disciplinary action. Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said that, according to by-laws, the church's <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district has six months to complete its investigation of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, though it is not expected to take that long `` Now that he has confessed to the sin, it will be a matter of the district meeting and forwarding a report and its reccommendation to the executive presbytery here in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> could be suspended or dismissed as an Assemblies minister. In either case, he would have the option of entering a rehabilitation program that would take at least two years, <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> appeared before his congregation in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, Sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an act he did not describe publicly. He said he would not return to his pulpit until the church investigation was completed.

<HEAD>27 People Killed In Two Days Despite State of Siege Emergency
Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers, guerrillas and a communist leader were killed Monday despite emergency measures to curb one of the bloodiest spates of violence the country has seen in three decades. Ten peasants were singled out at a cockfight Sunday and shot by men wearing black hoods, official reports said. In all, 27 people have been killed in ambushes and assassinations over two days. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> last month ordered a state of emergency in an attempt to halt a wave of violence that has taken the lives of more than 1,700 people in the last year. More than 120 people have been killed this year. Most of those deaths came after <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> ordered army troops to reinforce the police and increased jail terms for many violent crimes, especially those committed by drug traffickers, leftist guerrillas and paid assassins. Leftist guerrillas on Monday released seven mayors and two reporters kidnapped earlier this month, the radio stations RCN and <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> said. Last week the rebels freed four mayors and a reporter they had abducted. The guerrillas warned the mayors to budget more money to help the poor and said they planned to blow up the country's main oil pipeline again to keep oil from being exported. All 11 mayors and three reporters kidnapped were from towns in northeast <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and all had been held for about a week. The kidnappings were by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION>, which follows the political ideology of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. The rebel group has blown up the country's main oil pipeline 13 times since Jan. 12. The latest victim of an apparent right wing death squad was <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonima </PERSON>, a communist leader and assistant city attorney in the northwest city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. A man riding on a motorcycle Monday shot and killed <PERSON> Gonima </PERSON> and wounded his driver as <PERSON> Gonima </PERSON> headed for work at city hall, the national police said in a news release. <PERSON> Gonima </PERSON> was a member of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, which has seen more than 500 of its members killed since it was organized by former guerrillas in 1985. Leftist guerrillas ambushed an army patrol Monday, killing four soldiers, the press office for the government of the state of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> said in a news release. In southwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> guerrillas attacked the towns of Trujillo and <LOCATION> Caloto </LOCATION> on Sunday and killed seven policemen, the army's <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique. Near Vistahermosa, in a jungled area in the southeast state of <LOCATION> Meta </LOCATION>, 20 men wearing black hoods and carrying submachine guns surrounded dozens of men attending a cockfight on Sunday, the police said. Ten peasants were separated from the group and and shot as they pleaded for their lives, the policer said. The police report did not say who was suspected in the massacre. Drug traffickers have long dominated large areas of the vast jungles in eastern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The traffickers kill people they suspect of being informers or for refusing to let traffickers use their land for growing coca trees, the source for cocaine. A broadcast reporter and a mother and her 15-month-old girl were killed Sunday when gunmen opened fire on the reporter's car as the three traveled along a highway near the western city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, the national police there said in a news release. The reporter, <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Zambrano </PERSON>, of the Cali station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>, was the 30th reporter to be slain in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in 11 years. <PERSON> Zambrano </PERSON> reported frequently on the government's efforts against narcotics. An Indian running for mayor in a small town in northwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was assassinated Sunday. The victim, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Motato </PERSON>, was the leading candidate for mayor in the town of <LOCATION> Riosucio </LOCATION>, the mayor there, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, said in a broadcast report over the radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Motato </PERSON> was the leader of an Indian movement for land reform and other programs to help poor people in the area in the state of <LOCATION> Caldas </LOCATION>. A city councilman, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON>, was also killed Sunday in <LOCATION> Chicogorodo </LOCATION> in the northwest state of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> quoted national police there as saying. The councilman was a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> party. About 100 members of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s two dominate parties, the Liberal and the Conservative, have been killed in the last year, with the army and police blaming guerrillas for most of the killings.

 A 24-year-old mental patient who was not considered dangerous walked away from a psychiatric center and assaulted two relatives with a hatchet Monday, critically injuring one of them, police said. The patient, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON>, was arrested at his home in the city's <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> section after he allegedly assaulted his brother-in-law and an uncle at 5 a.m., said Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a police spokesman. <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON> was not considered dangerous by officials at <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, to which he had been voluntarily admitted, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The brother-in-law, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Selvin </PERSON>, 30, was struck twice in the head by the hatchet. He underwent surgery for his wounds and was listed in critical condition at <LOCATION> Jacobi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. The uncle, <PERSON> Onis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON>, 46, was in stable condition at the hospital with cuts to the left hand. Both men lived with <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON> was being held on charges of first-degree assault and criminal possession of a deadly instrument, the hatchet. <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON> escaped from the psychiatric center Saturday evening, <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said. `` He got into an unlocked janitor's closet on the second floor, broke the window and escaped by tying a bunch of sheets together and climbing from the second floor window,'' <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON> was voluntarily admitted to the hospital Feb. 16., <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON> had left the center without consent Feb. 8, the spokesman said. Police were called to the family home Feb. 13 because <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON> was behaving irrationally, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. He then voluntarily readmitted himself. Patients who are voluntarily admitted to the hospital may petition to leave at any time, but the approval process takes up to three days, <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said.

 A contingency plan to help prevent an uncontrolled meltdown of the financial markets won the endorsement Monday of the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and three other representatives. `` Our markets remain vibrant, but they are at the same time delicate,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., wrote in a letter to the heads of three regulatory agencies `` To permit them to function without such a contingency plan courts unnecessary risk.'' The letter was also signed by Reps. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, ranking minority member on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, ranking minority member of the finance subcommittee The letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was prompted by the Oct. 19 stock crash. `` The market decline ... was a wrenching and sobering experience for the marketplace, market participants, regulators and those of us in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with oversight responsibilities for our securities markets,'' the letter said. It noted a recommendation by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' research arm, that regulators prepare a plan for dealing with any similar emergency in the future. `` We believe that his recommendation ... should be implemented as a concrete first step toward increased coordination among the markets and restoration of investor confidence,'' the letter said. The congressmen asked the regulators to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by March 25 on their efforts to craft a plan for coordinating decisions by regulators and communicating them to the markets. They also asked the agencies to determine `` how much authority the marketplaces should have to act independently of the regulators in crisis circumstances.'' The letter urged the agencies to agree on circumstances that would allow relaxed interpretation of rules `` to facilitate market liquidity, such as the interpretation of rules associated with corporate stock repurchase plans,'' and on the provision of funds to the economy by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> during times of market turmoil. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has been considering long-term measures to ensure greater market coordination, ranging from a partial merger of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> to the creation of a new oversight body.

He is now in the protective custody of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> recently told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> agreed to provide training for Nicaraguan anti-Sandinista rebels after recieving a request from North in 1985. North sought the training on <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> soil because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aide to the rebels, <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, who was fired last month as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told congressional hearings earlier this month that <PERSON> North </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on a yacht in June 1985 near the Panamanian city of <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION>. The two met again four months later in <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s office, <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> said.

North was fired the same day that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> submitted his resignation to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In his testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> headed a `` criminal empire'' that sold drugs with the knowledge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> also said one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s pilots flew a cargo of cocaine to a ranch in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> owned by an American supporter of the Contras. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> earlier this month on charges that he accepted at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, said to supply 80 percent of the cocaine shipped to this country. The indictments charge that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> accepted the payoffs in return for laundering drug money, providing protection for cocaine shipments and a haven for drug dealers. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has strongly denied any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>State, Local Government Workers Got Raises Averaging 4.9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State and local government workers received annual pay raises last year averaging 4.9 percent under collective bargaining contracts with public employee unions, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The pay increases were below the average 5.7 percent raises received by state and local government employees in 1986. But the workers still fared better last year than federal employees who got a 3 percent pay increase and private sector workers whose wages rose an average 3.3 percent. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> noted that union contracts in the public and private sectors differ significantly. State and local governments, for example, tend to have a higher proportion of professional and white-collar workers. Union contracts in the private sector, on the other hand, often include lump-sum bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments excluded from the wage calculations and usually absent in the public sector. The figures showed that local government workers with wage increases averaging 5.3 percent outpaced state employees workers with an average 4.3 percent raise. Among occupation groups, primary and secondary school teachers got the biggest raises at 6.3 percent, followed by transit and other transportation workers at 4.8 percent.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cautioned the nation's governors Monday against pressing for costly federal solutions to the problems of welfare and child care His remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> were labeled a disappointment by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a Democratic presidential hopeful, who said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should be backing the governors' bipartisan welfare reform bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> instead said he still strongly supports a less costly Republican alternative that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected two months ago. He also cautioned the governors to go slow on the issue of child care, where both Democrats and Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are proposing to expand federal support and subsidies for working parents. `` Maybe it's my conservative bent, but I ca n't help but feel uneasy sometimes,'' he told the governors gathered in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> of the White House. Welfare programs have become `` a crippling poverty trap. ... They keep the poor poor,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Now, much of the push for child care is designed to rectify the ills of earlier programs, and many of these efforts are timely and good. But in this area, more than any other, government should tread carefully.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the alternative bill sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., would also give states freedom to `` develop your own ideas on child care. Afterwards, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters that he was very disappointed. `` Just one word from the president, I think, would get this bill passed and done before the election, and get it off the table as a partisan issue and get going,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He keeps telling us stories about <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and we're trying to explain to him that the vast majority of people on welfare these days are single mothers with young children, and it's a combination of real training for real jobs, combined with day care, that makes a difference,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the House-passed welfare reform bill, but might approve a less expensive measure still being shaped by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The governors are pushing Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s bill, which would toughen enforcement of child support, help states pay for job training and make participation mandatory for most unemployed adults. It would also provide some transitional Medicaid and welfare benefits for families exiting the relief rolls for work. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat, has 56 co-sponsors for his bill, which would cost $ 2.3 billion over five years, compared to the $ 4.3 billion <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, which would raise benefits and prohibit states from denying welfare to families with both parents in the home. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill is not yet satisfactory, but he held out the hope that <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., might be able to fashion a compromise satisfactory to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has not introduced an alternative bill. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview he heard two messages from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: `` One says that we're going to veto the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill. The other says we can try to work something out. I choose to respond to the second message. There's too much at stake here. If the president is interested in the subject, I'll be happy to work with Sen. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> on anything.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who spearheaded passage of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, said in an interview, `` The time to do something about welfare is now and the only person who seems opposed to it or looking at the past is the president. We're not going to end child poverty by leaving it to the states to do it. They do n't have the money.'' Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a Republican, told reporters, `` I think there's just a fundamental disagreement about how far to go on welfare reform, especially with regard to cost. The governors changed their mind, not the president.'' But despite that sticking point, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said, `` I still hold out hope that between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> we'll get a bill.'' <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, a Democrat who is leading the governors' push for welfare reform, emerged from the meeting and said he felt <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was open to compromise. `` I am encouraged because basically their negotiating strategy with everybody always is to take the hardest possible line and then come off of it at the end,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said. In the private meeting that followed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said, `` I told him we thought his bill was not a good bill and that we were willing to make some changes in what came out of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but we were n't going to get anywhere if his emissary kept saying, ` Well, we're going to veto whatever passes that we do n't like.'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied that `` he heard us ... and was willing to work with us, so I think that's good.'' <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, a Republican, said he shared <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s misgivings about the House-passed welfare bill He said it `` might really compound the problem'' by increasing federal funding without giving states more control over welfare rules. What the states need is flexibility to allow them to `` gradually remove -LRB- people -RRB- from welfare'' instead of terminating their benefits as soon as they get a job, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. Later, the governors' committee on human resources heard television's Captain Kangaroo, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeshan </PERSON>, plead for corporations to start providing quality day care. `` I'm almost ashamed at times to be an American,'' the children's performer and advocate said. `` We are half a century behind in addressing day care. We are going to pay an enormous price a quarter-century down the line.''

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said Monday the new U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms control treaty wo n't be ratified until after his <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the panel finishes its line-by-line examination of the pact. That laborious process began Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 31 volumes of documents involved in the long negotiations which led to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- pact. `` It is very regrettable that we have to go through this,'' said the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat, who emerged victorious in a fight with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the legal meaning of treaties. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, chairman of the armed services panel, said he did n't know how long it would take the committee to finish its work. The panel is one of three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees considering the treaty, which was signed in December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Ratification by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which requires a two-thirds vote, is expected later. The INF fight was based on a previous dispute between the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars anti-missile program. A number of Star Wars tests would be banned unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> moved from the current `` narrow'' interpretation of the ABM treaty to a `` broad'' view. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had asserted it was n't bound by what previous administrations told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the meaning of the ABM pact, a view the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at one point tried to push in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate over the INF treaty. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> threatened to block the treaty until Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> promised last month that administration comments on the treaty were `` authoritative,'' meaning that future administrations could n't try to change how the treaty is viewed. Since <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s promise was delivered, `` we can now proceed, confident that the treaty the committee is being asked to approve is the same treaty'' the administration believes it negotiated, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, one of the chief negotiators for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team which worked out the treaty, during a committee meeting Monday. The committee has sent the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> a list of 135 questions about possible ambiguities in the treaty, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. Most are technical questions but some involve queries about possible interpretation of the pact, which bans missiles with ranges from 300 miles to 3,400 miles. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, `` I'm sorry there was a reinterpretation of the ABM treaty that made this necessary.'' `` It's sad we have to go through the exercise we're going through here,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>. While the Armed Services panel was going through a detailed scrutiny of the pact, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> continued taking testimony from public witnesses. Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON>, the physicist who is considered the father of both the hydrogen bomb and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars program, told the foreign relations panel he thought the fights over the meanings of treaties were `` senseless debates.'' <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> said he supports the treaty, although he is deeply distrustful of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Speaking of the treaty, he said, `` my personal approach is careful, doubtful, yet positive,'' he said.

 Six European relief workers abducted by rebels in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> province were released Monday and are in good condition, spokesmen for a Belgian medical organization reported. They said the doctors and nurses were seized Thursday in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> where separatists have been fighting the Marxist government for years. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreels </PERSON>, president of the Belgian branch of Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB-, told a news conference the victims were Belgian doctors <PERSON> Germaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanquet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreau </PERSON>, Dutch nurse <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Raaijmaekers </PERSON> an Irish doctor and two <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> nurses. <PERSON> Moreels </PERSON> said they were released in <LOCATION> Adigrat </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Idaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamous </LOCATION> where the aid organization has been operating a hospital for three years. News of their release was reported to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> by Dr. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Harze </PERSON>, who had been sent to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to try to gain their freedom. <PERSON> Morrels </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harze </PERSON> had not yet met with the six. <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Luxen </PERSON>, director of the Belgian organization, said the two Belgian doctors would go to northern city of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> and return to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> later this week. He said other doctors would replace them at the hospital in <LOCATION> Idaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamous </LOCATION>, 340 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Luxen </PERSON> said the medical team was abducted without violence by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of the Tigre who also seized the group's vehicle and medical supplies. <PERSON> Seyoum </PERSON> <PERSON> Musse </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, had announced earlier Monday that the six had been released. In a telephone interview in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, he said: `` The whole aim of taking them with us was to show there are millions of people who are beyond the reach of ... isolated symbolic -LRB- government -RRB- food distribution centers like the one they were stationed at. `` The aim is to dispel the government's misinformation that millions are being reached with aid,'' he added.

<HEAD>Peace Corps To Get Graduate School Volunteers Under New Programs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two more universities on Monday announced plans to help boost the number and expertise of <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers with programs giving them graduate-level training or course credits for their service. Starting with about 10 students in the 1988-89 school year, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> will offer candidates for master's degrees in public health a chance to `` get their training before they do their -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- service,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Navia </PERSON>, chairman of the school's public health department. `` Some of our finest -LRB- public health graduate -RRB- students are the ones who have served in other countries as Peace Corps volunteers. And many of them have the frustration: ` If only I had know this then,''' <PERSON> Navia </PERSON> said at a news conference at the Carter Presidential Center. `` We're going to reverse the order.'' Peace Corps Director <PERSON> Loret </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> also signed an agreement Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which will offer internship credit to special education graduate students who do a tour of duty in the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said the two programs are similar to one announced earlier for public health master's degree candidates at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, also starting next fall. And all three are modeled after a program for master's degree students in public policy at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which will send its first group of volunteers to the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> this spring. `` These programs will help us ensure a steady flow of volunteers with the skills we need in developing countries,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> said. She said the Corps hopes to double the number of volunteers by 1992 and to increase dramatically the number of minority volunteers, who now number about 110 out of 5,200. The Peace Corps is starting a number of innovative programs to help meet that goal. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to send some of its fifth-year dental students to the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> for six-month stints, in an experiment with shorter tours of duty than the usual two years, she said. Under another new program, teachers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> can take sabbaticals to spend a year in Peace Corps-sponsored teacher training centers around the world, she said. In <LOCATION> Northfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, some military cadets at <ORGANIZATION> Norwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> are participating in a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> alternative to campus <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> and eventual military service. A bill pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would authorize $ 5 million a year for five years to enable the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to test the ROTC-alternative program elsewhere. Both the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> programs will target minorities.

 A funeral will be held Wednesday for <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a leading authority on nutrition who died at age 94. A professor emeritus at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> died Saturday of pneumonia in an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> nursing home. He had been in ill health for several months, but still kept in touch with UT scientists, many of whom he persuaded to come to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' work in nutrition at the <ORGANIZATION> UT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which he founded, led to the discovery of more vitamins and their variants than at any other research facility in the world. He was particularly interested in the role nutrition played in physical and mental well-being. Until he retired in 1985, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> worked regularly in his laboratory on the <LOCATION> UT </LOCATION> campus. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was a proponent of `` biochemical individuality,'' a concept that no two people are exactly alike physiologically and therefore everyone has different nutritional requirements. One of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' most significant accomplishments was the discovery and isolation of pantothenic acid, one of the `` universal vitamins'' required by all living cells and essential to life. Later he discovered and named folic acid, a substance used by every cell in the body. Survivors include his wife, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>, three sons, a daughter, nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' Greek and Turkish leaders sparred Monday only a day after elections, with the Turkish head proposing talks in neutral territory and the Greek president-elect insisting they be held on his own turf. The dispute over a matter of protocol disappointed some who had for a new start in talks to reunify <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in a federation. The sparring began when <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> invited Greek Cypriot president-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> to informal talks on the future of the island, to be held in a neutral area. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> countered with an invitation to <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> `` to come and see me at the presidential palace.'' `` I am the elected president of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and in that capacity I would be most happy to welcome Mr. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> as the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said in a radio interview. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> is president of the breakaway <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which was proclaimed in 1983 and is internationally recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. He does not recognize <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, who will be sworn in next Sunday, as president of all <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, a millionaire businessman backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, defeated veteran right-wing politician <PERSON> Glafcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> in general elections Sunday. Only Greek Cypriots voted. An official announcement said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> a message of congratulations, expressing the wish to continue relations with <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` I look forward, through you, to continuing the friendly relations between our two countries, a relationship which has been characterized by a special warmth and a constant effort to build mutual respect and understanding,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s message said. `` I know that you have the determination to make the effort to bring about the lasting peace which has so long escaped the people of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>,'' the message said. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said he will thank <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a message expressing hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will more actively to persuade <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to withdraw its troops. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> proposed in his invitation to <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> that the talks be held at the <ORGANIZATION> Ledra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters on the Green Line dividing Turkish and Greek Cypriots. He said the meeting `` would be between the leaders of the two politically equal parties or between the presidents of two equal political entities.'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> had said during his campaign that he was willing to meet with the Turkish Cypriots without preconditions. But his counter-offer to meet <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> at the presidential palace in the Greek Cypriot-controlled zone, citing his own role as president of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> only as leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, was certain to be rebuffed. In the interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> indicated no new flexibility in the conflict between <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriots. He accused <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> of building up its military presence in the Turkish Cypriot zone in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> since the 1974 invasion which partitioned the island. The invasion followed a coup by Greek Cypriot extremists aimed at uniting the entire island with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. `` The realities of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> are that in these years, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, instead of recucing its military presence here, has been building it up in every way,'' he said. He also accused <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> of bringing in 40,000 to 50,000 Turkish settlers to beef up the Turkish Cypriot minority, which numbered 120,000 at the time of the invasion. The Greek Cypriot population is more than 500,000. After election results were announced early Monday, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said he would work for the withdrawal of Turkish troops and settlers, but woud try to achieve a spirit of rapprochement with the Turkish Cypriots. Greek-Turkish negotiations have been stalled since President <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, who lost a bid for a third term in the first round of elections Feb. 14, rejected proposals for a two-zone federation proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. The proposals had been accepted by <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, who now insists upon them as the basis for restarting talks. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> had insisted that before any talks began on a federation, all Turkish troops must withdraw and the Turks must allow <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> refugees, who fled after the 1974 invasion, to return to their homes in the north. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> proposals suggested that talks on troop withdrawal and the `` right of return'' would be discussed by committees simultaneously with talks on the nature of the federation.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> tasted the fruits of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms first-hand Monday as he hosted a candlelit dinner at a cooperative restaurant that was once a money-losing bar. The red-brick Skazka -LRB- `` Fairy Tale'' -RRB- restaurant off southeastern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> would have been illegal before last year's decision by Soviet authorities to loosen laws governing individual labor and cooperative ownership. `` As soon as we heard they were authorizing cooperatives, we decided to start one,'' said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutuzov </PERSON>, the head of the nine-member collective that runs the <LOCATION> Skazka </LOCATION>. The restaurant, which can seat 34 customers in its upstairs dining room, opened April 1 last year. Its hearty Russian fare swiftly made it so popular with Muscovites and foreign residents that profits soared to as much as $ 23,300 a month, <PERSON> Kutuzov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Skazka </PERSON>'s friendly waitresses and prompt service are in stark contrast to the situation that prevails at most of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s state-owned restaurants, where customers sometimes wait for hours before being served Cooperatives are also more expensive than state-run restaurants, which has led some Soviets to oppose them as socially unjust. The dinner menu offered <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> cost between $ 25 and $ 33 per person, <PERSON> Kutuzov </PERSON> said, compared to an average of $ 3 to $ 8 for an evening meal in a government-owned restaurant. A table piled with sturgeon in aspic, pickled vegetables inside a pumpkin, bottles of mineral water and grapes was set out for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who had finished two days of talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with top Soviet officials, including <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. <PERSON> Skazka </PERSON>'s chefs also prepared homemade noodle soup with mushrooms, a cabbage soup called `` shchi,'' stuffed pork cutlets, dumplings with mushroom and chicken and small Russian pancakes. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who was accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, met in the dining room with some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top cultural figures and intellectuals, including cinematographer <PERSON> Elem </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimov </PERSON>, playwright <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>, economist <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelov </PERSON> and writer <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Soloukhin </PERSON>. Reporters briefly allowed into the wood-paneled room before <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived spotted one apparent concession to the VIP guests _ bottles of Georgian and French wines set out on a table. As a cooperative, the Skazka normally does not have the right to serve alcohol. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in mid-January that 13,000 co-ops had been established in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said more than 300,000 people were working for themselves within guidelines set by the government to encourage better services and goods than those provided by the state-run sector. The venture has been a clear success for the nine people who put up a total of $ 5,000 to launch the Skazka. Last month <PERSON> Kutuzov </PERSON>, chairman of the Skazka cooperative, took home $ 1,050, more than three times the average Soviet wage of $ 330. The building that now contains the restaurant was once a bar favored by `` Lyubers,'' body-building enthusiasts from a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> suburb that some press reports have said prey on long-haired Soviet youths who like Western rock music. Either because of its tough clientele, or because the health-conscious <PERSON> Lyubers </PERSON> did not drink enough alcohol, the bar lost money, <PERSON> Kutuzov </PERSON> said. Now its clientele has radically changed, with foreigners making up as much as 90 percent of the dinner customers on a given evening, <PERSON> Kutuzov </PERSON> said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to investigate allegations by a Panamanian dissident that the agency passed personal information to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strong man, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, about <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, it was disclosed Monday. The request was made in a letter <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> sent last week to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> following congressional testimony two weeks ago by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> associate who is now a leading critic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s defense chief. In the letter, a copy of which was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said it is `` improper and illegal'' for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to maintain files on members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At the time of <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>'s testimony, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said it `` categorically denies'' his allegations. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, had no comment Monday on <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' letter except to say that communications from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are confidential but are taken seriously and are answered. In a separate letter to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asked whether the agency had ever passed on information about members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or their staffs to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and whether it ever it had engaged in wiretaps or surveillance on him or members of his staff. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Feb. 9, said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> passed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> data about <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and two of their aides The two senators have been among <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s strongest critics on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, citing allegations of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement in drug <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>'s credibility `` appeared to be high.'' He added that he received information from other countries indicating the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had delivered similar information to them on other senators. He asked <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> whether the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had ever maintained information on members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or their staffs and whether such information was ever passed on to any official of a foreign government, specifically the Panamanian Defense Forces. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> indicated he was skeptical about the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s denial, contending that it made an inquiry afterward to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> field offices and to the heads of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies involved in national security issues as to whether the denial was accurate. Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said she was unable to comment on that allegation. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, meanwhile, met under heavy guard Monday at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

But <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON>, 35, expects leniency for his testimony against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, which included <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON>'s report that he made made $ 900,000 in payoffs to the Panamanian strongman. `` Obviously, he's hoping he wo n't have to spend too much time in jail,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGuerin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON>'s friend and defense attorney in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> pleaded guilty a year ago during the trial of his partner, <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritch </PERSON>, and has since emerged as a principal witness against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> conspiracy case. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also faces separate racketeering and drug charges in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ritch </PERSON>, 34, is serving a sentence of 30 years in prison.

In exchange for a Bell 212 helicopter <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> bought for the defense forces, according to the charges, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arranged for an irrevocable $ 2 million line of credit for <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> from a Panamanian bank. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also provided <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> with a diplomatic passport and agreed to let <PERSON> Ritch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> use Panamanian banks to launder more than $ 100 million in anticipated profits from a million-pound marijuana smuggling venture that <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> was organizing in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in early 1984, according to the federal charges. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> began his career in drug trafficking at an early age, his friends say. The son of a mid-level <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive who died in 1980, <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and grew up in <LOCATION> Bellaire </LOCATION>, a comfortable suburb of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeGuerin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> was already selling marijuana when he dropped out of the 11th grade. `` I do n't believe he ever had a straight job,'' said <PERSON> DeGuerin </PERSON>. By age 27, <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> had been indicted twice in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for trying to import 140,000 pounds of marijuana in two loads nine days apart in December 1979. The second seizure _ 100,000 pounds _ was then the largest ever in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> eventually fled, assumed a new identity and in 1983 settled in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, where he worked with <PERSON> Ritch </PERSON>, says Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ritch </PERSON> set up a smuggling organization and a sophisticated nationwide distribution network that made more than $ 200 million in four years. The Kalish-Ritch organization began to fall apart when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrested <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> on July 26, 1984, as he was boarding a chartered <ORGANIZATION> Lear </ORGANIZATION> jet under an assumed name at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Nofziger Attorneys Try To Overturn Guilty Verdict, Get New Trial</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s defense attorneys filed motions Monday to set aside the former presidential aide's illegal lobbying convictions on the grounds that prosecutors failed to prove he violated the law. The defense also filed a motion for a new trial, contending that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> erroneously instructed jurors about determining whether the issues <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> lobbied about were of `` direct and substantial'' interest to the White House. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, 63, was convicted Feb. 11 of three counts of illegally lobbying former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> A-10 anti-tank plane. The former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director faces a potential two-year prison term and a $ 10,000 fine for each of the three convictions. He is scheduled to be sentenced March 25. In its motions in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the defense repeated contentions made throughout the four-week trial that the prosecution team headed by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> failed to prove that the issues <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> raised with former colleagues were `` particular matters'' of `` direct and substantial interest'' to the White House. `` The gross insufficiency of the evidence mandates that the guilty verdict ... against Mr. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> b set aside and that a judgment of acquittal be entered,'' defense lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said in their pleadings. In asking for a new trial, the defense said the definition of `` direct and substantial interest'' that <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> gave the jury during final instructions `` clearly encompassed interest well beyond the scope of the statute.'' This instruction allowed jurors to confuse the `` personal interest of certain representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' with `` direct and substantial'' interest, the defense said. For instance, references in testimony to <PERSON> Pier </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Talenti </PERSON>, a volunteer on <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s White House staff who visited <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plant, might be the only basis for the jury to conclude the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had an interest in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for a military engine contract, the defense said. Although he was not called as a witness, <PERSON> Talenti </PERSON> was described by a former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executive as expressing interest in the company's bid for a contract to build small engines for the Army in 1981. An Army procurement official also testified that <PERSON> Talenti </PERSON> urged consideration of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s bid that year. The defense said <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>'s `` internally inconsistent and confusing'' instruction `` failed adequately to explain the comparative and relative importance of a matter to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and it did not instruct the jury to place that interest in its proper context.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in early 1982, was convicted, among other things, for sending an April 8, 1982, memo to then-presidential counselor <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> urging support for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to persuade reluctant <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials to award the $ 32 million contract. `` The very purpose of the communication to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was to create and stimulate interest, a contact that is not prohibited'' by the law, the defense said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, now attorney general, testified at the trial that he could n't recall receiving <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s note, which suggested he enlist the support of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top administration officials.

 Former TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> took out $ 5.5 million in loans last month as the presidential contenders headed to the cash-draining Super Tuesday primaries, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained by far the richest candidate with more than $ 9 million in the bank. Among Democratic hopefuls, money leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a $ 4 million bankroll, his financial statement shows. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported $ 5.5 million in loans and contributions of $ 1.3 million during January, in addition to the $ 6.5 million he got in federal matching funds. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had earlier said he might not use the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed to the public financing system. He ended the month with $ 5.5 million in cash on hand, second only to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s warchest, but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had an outstanding debt of $ 6 million. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign did not immediately return calls Monday evening to answer questions about where he got the loan or what it was for. In an interesting twist, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while raising the most money, has actually spent less against the overall primary season spending limit than any of the other Republican contenders, including the struggling campaign of Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces have been carefully husbanding their resources to ensure they do n't reach the $ 27 million limit too early in the nominating campaign, thereby shorting themselves for the contests that come after the Super Tuesday races on March 8. The latest campaign figures are contained in reports filed over the weekend with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The reports cover totals for the month of January. As of Jan. 31, the vice president had spent $ 10.7 million against the $ 27 million cap, compared to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s $ 12.8 million. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., had spent $ 13.5 million and ended January with $ 4.2 million in the bank <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported spending a whopping $ 17.5 million against the cap, and his report showed heavy expenditures across the Super Tuesday states, topped by more than $ 1 million spent in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. By contrast, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent $ 335,743 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spent $ 81,645 there, and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spent $ 11,312. On the Democratic side, none of the candidates were approaching that level, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spending the most against the ceiling, at $ 7.8 million. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> continued to squeak by financially, taking out $ 750,000 worth of loans in January and ending the month with a debt of $ 1.3 million. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> hoped to pay that off with the help of nearly $ 600,000 in government matching funds he expects to receive by the end of this month, said campaign political director <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aides are relying on a heavy mail solicitation which has brought in a steady flow of money in recent weeks, including most of the $ 1 million <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> raised in January, he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is netting about $ 400,000 a week in fund-raising, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. Black insisted the campaign is not in serious financial trouble, though he conceded, `` Sure, I'd like to have another couple million to spend on Super Tuesday.'' He said he has budgeted about $ 1.5 million for the campaign through Super Tuesday, and is spending between $ 250,000 and $ 300,000 on television for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s March 5 primary <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s spending against the overall limit is not a problem because he will buy TV time in only seven Super Tuesday states. Among the Democrats, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> both ended January in debt, and had to take out loans to keep their campaigns afloat in February's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> took out a $ 523,674 loan in January, and ended the month with a $ 691,069 debt and only $ 401,176 in the bank. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> did not report any January loans but, according to aides, did borrow money this month. He entered February with $ 820,260 in debts and $ 172,477 in cash on hand. Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, on the other hand, were in good shape _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with $ 4 million in the bank and $ 511,789 in bills to pay off, and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> with $ 2 million on hand and $ 84,248 in obligations. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ignored the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> race to concentrate on the Super Tuesday states, but he raised very little money during the time the other candidates were campaigning hard in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. He collected only $ 180,746 in contributions during January, in addition to the $ 1.8 million in matching funds he got, his report showed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised $ 804,839 in contributions and got $ 3.5 million matching funds. Most candidates got very large matching fund payments in January, the first month the government funds were released, and the sums were based on the candidates' fund-raising for all preceding months. Candidates can receive matching funds from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for every contribution of $ 250 or less. The fund is supported by the $ 1 checkoff on individual tax returns. Democratic contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reported raising $ 610,036 in donations, plus $ 598,021 in matching funds during January, ending the month with $ 509,978 in cash on hand and $ 354,881 in obligations. Former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> ended the month with $ 615,547 in cash on hand after collecting $ 70,303 in contributions and $ 937,325 in matching funds. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s finance director, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, announced that the senator has raised more than $ 1 million in donations so far this year, and in the two weeks following the Feb. 8 <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> contest set a record for his campaign. His report shows that in January he raised $ 534,259 in contributions, $ 1.9 million in matching funds, and $ 523,674 in loans. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> collected $ 212,702 in contributions and $ 1.9 million in matching funds. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>, has said that the congressman will not buy TV advertising in all 20 Super Tuesday states, but will concentrate on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. As of the Jan. 31 report, however, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had spent very little in those states _ for example, a total of $ 69,809 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, compared to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' $ 301,829, and $ 23,454 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, compared to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' $ 206,861 there. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had spent less than $ 5,000 each as of the beginning of this month. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has also far outspent <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the South, a region in which the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator has pinned his presidential hopes.

<HEAD>Firefighters Continue to Call in Sick</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 All firefighters scheduled to work Monday night's shift joined scores of other colleagues in calling in sick, leaving <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>'s fire protection to 87 firefighters who have been on duty around the clock since Friday. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge delayed ruling on the city's request for contempt citations against 110 firefighters who called in sick over the weekend in defiance of a back-to-work order Judge <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> gave union president <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> until 10 a.m. Tuesday to inform all 450 members of the union that they must to return to work under the temporary restraining order issued Saturday by another judge. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was also ordered to furnish a list of all firefighters who had called in sick over the weekend and outline the nature of their illness or the illness of family members they said they were staying home to care for. City officials went from home to home Monday leaving notices for firefighters of the contempt hearing. <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> indicated his decision to put off ruling on the matter hinged on the relatively low number of firefighters contacted either by the city or <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The union represents 450 of the city's total uniformed force of 479. <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> indicated his decision to put off ruling on the matter hinged on the relatively low number of firefighters contacted either by the city or <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a fire captain, denies the union orchestrated any sickout. If found to be a job action as <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> and city officials assert, the sickout would be illegal under <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> law. The dispute apparently concerns language in a contract ratified by firefighters in December that the city has yet to sign. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the city is trying to renege on a provision that calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit. Union members also complain that promises to replacement worn-out or damaged equipment like boots, helmets and firecoats have not been fulfilled. All but one of the 51 firefighters scheduled to report for work at 8 a.m. Saturday called in sick Friday, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moise </PERSON>. An additional 60 called in sick for the shift that was supposed to begin at 6 a.m. Sunday, <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> said. Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> that all of the firefighters scheduled to report at 6 p.m. Monday had called in sick. `` I have nobody coming in,'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> testified. The union represents 450 of the city's total uniformed force of 479. The firefighters, divided into four platoons, work two 10-hour days and two 12-hour days, then are off four days. <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> said the 87 firefighters in the platoon that has been kept on duty since Friday evening will stay on the job until the issue is resolved. The chief testified the average absentee level is seven to eight firefighters for any particular shift. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> agreed the number of sick firefighters was `` unusually high.'' Most of the people he contacted after the restraining order was issued said either they or someone in their family had a 24-hour virus, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he called in sick because his mother, who has heart trouble, also had the flu. <PERSON> Ragosta </PERSON> tried to show the sickout presented a danger to the public health and safety. <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> said he was becoming concerned that fatigue among firefighters on the job since Friday might affect their ability to operate sophisticated equipment and their response time in a crisis. He said the sickout was costing $ 20,000 a day in overtime and related expenses.

<HEAD>Report Near Collision Between Helicopter And Jet Fighter: Third in
Two Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An oil rig helicopter and a Phantom jet fighter came within a half-mile of colliding over the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Monday, according to the helicopter firm. It was the third reported near-miss in two weeks in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s crowded skies. The earlier incidents involved jetliners carrying hundreds of passengers and prompted calls for an inquiry into growing air congestion before the summer travel season begins. The government on Monday accused air traffic controllers of fomenting `` public hysteria'' and said there was no cause for alarm. Bristow Helicopters said its <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> craft carrying 11 passengers and two crew members from an oil rig 165 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION> climbed sharply as it neared the Scottish city after air traffic controllers warned that it was on a collision course with a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet. <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> said its helicopter moved up from an altitude of 2,000 feet and the Phantom passed below. Both aircraft landed safely and no one was reported injured. A Bristow spokesman said the helicopter pilot filed an `` air miss'' report with the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, or CAA. Earlier Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> promised an investigation into an incident Sunday involving a British Caledonian BA 1-11 and a Pan American <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> the jetliners came within 2,000 yards while flying over southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> but he said they were not in danger of colliding. He said the number of near-misses had declined sharply in the last 10 years. `` We mus n't be complacent, neither must we overreact,'' he said. In the previous incident this month, a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L1011 </ORGANIZATION> and a Balkan Bulgarian Tu 54 with a total of 543 people aboard narrowly avoided colliding. The <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> called that an `` exceptionally serious'' case and <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said the authority took the unusual step of asking the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> to make an independent investigation. According to the <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION>, the number of near-misses per 100,000 flying hours in British air space decreased from 6.2 in 1980 to 2.8 in 1986. It said there were 12 incidents involving serious risk last year, unchanged from 1986. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest air traffic controllers' union, said the control system is nearly overloaded. `` The system is working at full blast,'' said <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, head of the 1,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION>. `` If a mistake is made then there is very little room to maneuver.'' He said safety should improve when a new computer system is inaugurated in 1990 and a new control center in 1995. The guild has demanded increased manpower in the meantime, saying five job vacancies at the main control center in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drayton </LOCATION> have not been filled since September. The <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday claimed the controllers were promoting public alarm to gain leverage in negotiations over working conditions, including the number of controllers on duty at peak times. `` The controllers are putting pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> by harping on the subject of safety,'' said the authority spokesman who was not identified in line with government policy. `` Anonymous controllers are constantly feeding information engendering alarm and concern.''

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday he might authorize military operations against terrorist base camps if he wins the White House. GOP hopeful <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> taunted Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for ceasing efforts in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, battlegrounds for this week's campaign contests. `` I do n't know where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>. `` Later today we're going to send him a map of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> so at least he gets a little idea where it is.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, virtually conceding the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses to his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rivals. But he predicted he would n't be hurt by that. `` I think I'm going to be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the vice president said in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is heavily favored to win the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> contest. But he sounded less confident of his chances for victory in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> have waged energetic campaigns. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has invested heavily in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in hopes of bagging a win outside his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> backyard. He, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have campaigned heavily in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> as well. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, while his spokesman accused <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of hypocrisy and released a list of what he said were switches in position the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator has made on issues ranging from abortion to farm policy to spending for the MX missiles. That was an attempt to turn the tables on <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has vigorously attacked <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for switching his position on key issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a brief visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he took part in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He emerged from the session to blast the president's anti-terrorism policy and say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be living with the consequences of secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a long time `` You never, ever make concessions to terrorism,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless.'' He added: `` This is international crime, pure and simple and you fight it the way you fight crime _ with tough police work, with effective undercover operations, with military operations against terrorist base camps if necessary.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not elaborate on what conditions might prompt him to authorize military operations. But White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said such talk could conceivably make life more difficult for a hostage. `` I would simply urge caution on everyone's part, including political candidates,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> during the day, invoking the name of the state's late Sen. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> as he bid to score well in the caucuses. The Illinois senator was cheered enthusiastically by a crowd at <ORGANIZATION> Gustavus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adolphus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, where he said he would propose a mutual nuclear test ban treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if elected. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> once said he needed to win in either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> this week to keep his campaign alive, but has since pulled back from that standard. `` I am going to do respectably,'' he said, adding he believes the Democratic race will stay muddled beyond the March 8 round of contests _ mostly in Southern and border states _ known as Super Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, financial reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign with the biggest bankroll _ $ 9 million _ going into the Super Tuesday primaries. Among Democratic hopefuls, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led with $ 4 million on hand. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported $ 5.5 million in loans and contributions of $ 1.3 million during January, in addition to the $ 6.5 million he got in federal matching funds. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had earlier said he might not use the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed to the public financing system. He ended the month with $ 5.5 million in cash on hand, second only to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s warchest, but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had an outstanding debt of $ 6 million. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign did not immediately return calls Monday evening to answer questions about where he got the loan or what it was for. With most of the campaign still to go, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had spent $ 10.7 million against the $ 27 million campaign limit, compared with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s $ 12.8 million and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s $ 13.5 million. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported spending a whopping $ 17.5 million against the cap, and his report showed heavy expenditures across the Super Tuesday states. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had spent the most against the ceiling, at $ 7.8 million. Also on Monday, Democrat <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won the endorsement of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> as he continued lining up support of as many Southern politicians as possible in advance of Super Tuesday. But in an unusual news conference, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said he wanted to `` educate'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> on some of the issues. `` He's not too far to the left, but I've got to try to bring him to the middle a little bit,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to work on him.'' In the Republican race, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> appeared before an economics class at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advocacy of a four-year budget freeze `` embarrassing.'' Said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, `` Can you think of anything more yawning in a peresidential campaign that having the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate running for president say, ` If I become president I'm going to freeze the budget for four years?''' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where he has declared he needs a win in the March 5 primary. He announced his support for legislation to limit textile imports and challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to do the same. At <ORGANIZATION> Lander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> won applause when he called for school prayer. It used to be, he said, that `` little children could pray in the public schools of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and we've got to see that once again.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won the endorsement of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's campaign manager, former Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, took several sharp jabs at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his campaign. He accused the vice president's campaign of taking two `` cheap shots'' before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. He said the first attempt failed. The second one `` worked short term. We'll see whether they worked in the long term,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> abruptly resigned Monday, accusing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> of abandoning the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and of demonstrating a lack of leadership and vision. `` This building needs to be led,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said in telling reporters of his decision. `` It needs leadership. It needs some vision. I'm saying that if I had a piece of advice to give to Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, it would be to spend a lot more time with the top leaders in this building. `` He's been spending a lot of time with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a lot of time on the Hill. I think they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> leaders -RRB- need to feel his vision and to understand what he believes in.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 42, a highly decorated Marine veteran of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat and the author of the best-selling <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war novel, `` Fields of Fire,'' left after only 10 months in his <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> position. He told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his resignation letter that the president could have realized his cherished goal of building a 600-ship fleet, were it not for <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. An administration official who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> wants to recommend that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, assistant to the president for legislative affairs, be nominated to replace <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. The source said the White House probably would announce <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s nomination on Tuesday, at the same time it announces formal acceptance of <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s resignation. Talking to reporters, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> of ordering him to keep quiet about internal budget fighting, saying the defense chief had written him a note saying he should deny news stories reporting it was the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ and not the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> _ proposing to mothball ships. `` Now, I'm not going to deny the truth,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declined to respond to the criticism, issuing a written statement saying only that he had learned of <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s resignation decision `` with regret.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added in a separate statement, however, that if <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had decided he could not `` defend the department's decisions'' on the budget, then `` under the circumstances, he has done the honorable thing.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to accommodate budgetary reductions. Secretary <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints, but I know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the country ...'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> budget, said in a statement: `` I'm sorry to see <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> go In his brief stint, he impressed the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as an able secretary.'' `` Although I am not endorsing his views, his resignation has obviously launched an important new stage of the debate about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> priorities and the size and type of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> we need.'' Three times, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> developed a plan for cutting its fiscal 1989 budget in such a way that the goal of expanding the fleet to 600 ships could still be reached. And each time, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s advice was `` ignored'' by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` I can only conclude that the decision to reduce the level of our fleet to a point that it may never reach the 600-ship goal was motivated by other than military and strategic reasoning,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> and others have argued that 600 ships were the minimum needed for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to meet its worldwide commitments. Since his recommendations `` were rejected by your secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, I am unable to support him personally or to defend this amended budget during budget deliberations -LRB- in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. `` Consequently, I find it necessary to resign from my position as ecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s decision to step down surprised <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials alike. He assumed the post only last April, seven months before <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, like all the services, was ordered in early December to slash its fiscal 1989 budget proposal to comply with a new deficit-reduction plan. Ultimately, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ended up being told to cut $ 12.3 billion from its original spending plan. As finally approved by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it wants $ 96.4 billion in budget authority and intends to mothball 16 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigates, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the mothballing would leave the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> with 580 ships by the end of fiscal 1989 and that it can still build to 600 by fiscal 1992. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> asserted, however, the mothballing is unnecessary and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would never reach 600 ships. `` One of the sad things about this is that this is one of the few goals of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that was really obtainable, at pretty low cost,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could have transferred those 16 frigates to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> `` for well under $ 100 million'' rather than place them in <LOCATION> mothballs </LOCATION>, preserving them as `` deployable'' warships ready for an emergency, he declared. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> declined to speculate on why <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> might have rejected such options. But in another broadside at the new <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> complained that once <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> arrived, `` the number of people who are participating in the decisions -LRB- became -RRB- smaller.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, one of the youngest men to ever become <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary, is a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduate. He came to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 under <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, assuming the post of assistant defense secretary for reserve affairs. He had resigned and was preparing to leave government service in early 1987 when the president asked him to replace <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, the first <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said Monday he intended to return to his work as a novelist and possibly, journalism as well.

<TEXT>
 Angry, defiant Palestinians marked `` Martyrs' Day'' in the occupied territories Monday with graveside speeches and stone-throwing demonstrations as they remembered the 61 Arabs killed in clashes since December. Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> meanwhile released a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, criticizing <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s policy of allowing soldiers to beat protesters. `` You can not use force as a means of punishment, abuse or humiliation,'' <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> said. One Palestinian was shot and wounded Monday in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and another was shot during a demonstration at <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to hospital sources. The army said it was checking the reports. Australian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, attending a dinner in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` sometimes arbitrary and violent way'' of dealing with the disturbances The <ORGANIZATION> Jersualem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> has strongly protested the Israeli actions. About 1,500 additional police officers, brought in from throughout <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, flooded <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in advance of the visit of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, set to begin Thursday. The reinforcements will back up the holy city's normal contingent of 1,000 officers. Authorities fear <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s presence will lead to an upsurge in violence by Arabs pressing their case for an end to 20 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, seized during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The latest spate of unrest started Dec. 8 and has resulted in scores of deaths, hundreds of injuries and arrests. In <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naami </LOCATION>, a village of 2,000 inhabitants six miles west of here, about 1,500 Arabs marched through the streets chanting anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans. In a fiery speech at the graveside of one of the two village residents who have died from army bullets, a speaker rejected the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> trip. `` From this grave we condemn the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. These masses,'' he said gesturing to the crowd, `` are led by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. We will continue to achieve our goals and not satisfy American policy in the region.'' Grafitti in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naami </LOCATION> read: `` No for the visit of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>; yes, to the Palestinian government. Yes to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Despite the rhetoric, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> moderates are trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to lift his ban against local Palestinians talking to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. If <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s peace plan is to succeed, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> needs to bring Palestinians into the talks. In an interview Monday in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was ready to meet with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We have declared that we are ready to meet with all of the permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, including the American administration,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning.'' `` Without a meeting with Palestinians, the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> initiative is bound to fail,'' said <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON>, a university professor and one of six Arabs originally slated to meet <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has expressed strong reservations about the American initiative. While saying he is willing to listen and consider any ideas from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he clearly does not like the American initiative which revolves around swapping land for peace. He also is worried about moving too quickly. In a speech to European Jewish leaders Sunday night, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said a long period of practical experience and coexistence is needed before the question of sovereignty can be broached. `` Any attempt to force the pace and to shorten the period would be a detriment to the very essence of the -LRB- Camp David -RRB- agreement,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the Parliament's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> will not withdraw from the territories, even under pressure. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, has largely accepted the American initiative. `` In the upcoming days we will have a political discussion in the Cabinet,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the radio Monday. `` Then we shall see whether we -LRB- he and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> -RRB- can talk to Mr. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as partners or not.'' The radio quoted the prime minister as saying he and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> could be forced to call early elections because of their disagreements. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Etty </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON> said the attorney general's letter was prompted by the many complaints received from Palestinians in the territories. `` I checked them and found the number of the complaints ... raised suspicion that defining these cases as ` aberrations' does not reflect reality,'' <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, nearing the end of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour, told <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, `` Australians are deeply concerned by what's happening today in the unrest in the occupied territories ... the sometimes arbitrary and violent way in which it has been met.'' In his response, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` did not want to dominate'' the Palestinians and added: `` I know my country has been painfully criticized by countries of the world. We take it seriously, with chagrin.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubert </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, as saying a letter recently was delivered to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> calling on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` to bring to an immediate end these serious acts perpetrated against civilians.'' It said the letter declared that `` thousands of people have been the victims of brutality and grave ill-treatment at the hands of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers.''

<TEXT>
 Police increased patrols Monday at a fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> television station that has been hit by sporadic sniper fire twice in a week. No one was injured in the latest incident, on Sunday morning, said WMPV-TV owner <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowlds </PERSON>. `` We just think it's some kind of weirdo,'' Bowlds said. `` He's not trying to hit anybody That's obvious. It may be somebody wanting publicity.'' <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, a producer at the station, said one employee was inside the building Sunday, but the shots were fired into the eaves. She also said glass was broken in the front door, but not by gunfire. She said she thought someone had attempted to break into the building. Police placed the building under surveillance after bullets hit it Wednesday. There have been no arrests in either incident. Police Capt. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said two additional patrol cars were assigned to the area. He said the sniper could have been encouraged by the station's on-the-air comment that officers seemed to take a long time to arrive after the first shooting incident. Ms. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> said a caller Friday threatened the lives of four employees, including herself and Bowlds. `` We just do n't know what this crazy person is up to,'' the producer said. Bowlds has reported other threatening calls since the station opened three years ago.

 The new operators of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> pledged Monday to reverse the news agency's financial losses but said they have not decided how to achieve that goal. `` It's a dynamic situation now,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s new president, said at a news conference. Hirings, firings and management changes are frozen for the next four to six weeks while the team draws up a business plan, he said. Dr. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the media investment group that assumed control of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> late Friday, said he and his associates will `` listen to everybody'' in devising a survival plan for UPI. `` We are going to employ the best skills we have to come up with a plan to take this business into the future,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said. `` And I do n't know what that is today.'' <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON>, 48, said he believed the market would support two general wire services, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I hope that is true,'' he said, adding he would not know the answer until he had interviewed current and potential clients. `` We think it can survive in some form or another,'' <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, 45, is a physician who served as health and welfare commissioner in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> under then-Gov. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He formed WNW group for the purpose of taking control of stock owned by <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>, the Mexican publisher. `` We purchased for cash _ a substantial cash payment _ an irrevocable proxy for control of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> owns 95 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> refused to say how much money was involved over the 10-year agreement, but he said the amount <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> receives will be influenced by what <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> finds in its study. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>, who paid $ 41 million to bring <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> out of Chapter 11 protection proceedings in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June 1986, relinquished all control over the stock. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> had waged an unsuccessful effort to buy <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> before the company emerged from Chapter 11. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> reportedly sank $ 50 million into <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, which is thought to be losing about $ 1 million a month. While the new management studies <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s financial picture and talks with news executives around the country, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said his company will underwrite <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s losses. `` Yes, it's going to cost a million a month to sit here and do a plan,'' he said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said it is possible WNW may conclude there is no way to turn around <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s finances, which presumably could lead to shutting down the agency. He called that scenario a `` low probability.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <ORGANIZATION> Infotech </ORGANIZATION>, an electronic communications company based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Infotech's subsidiaries include <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a 24-hour cable television service providing stock prices; <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Questech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Comtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` UPI is into a number of areas that are very synergistic to what Infotech does,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said. They include computer translations, electronic data base marketing and electronic publishing. Infotech, which will be a minority shareholder in <LOCATION> WNW </LOCATION>, is a public company. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> owns about 13 percent of the company and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owns about 14.5 percent. `` From Infotech's perspective, we see this as an investment opportunity,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said. `` We believe this company has a value greater than the amount of money it is losing.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, who wore a UPI pin in his lapel, said he had other reasons for wanting the company to survive. `` As a conservative Republican, as far as I'm concerned, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> is an extremely important asset to the American people,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend. Once a plan is in hand, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said he will look for new investors. They could include <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s employees, he said. Ultimately, <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>'s ownership share will be reduced by the infusion of new stockholders, he said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> was prohibited from buying <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> outright partly because of an agreement the <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, representing the agency's editorial employees, made with <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> That deal calls for the union to have the right of first refusal to buy <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> should <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> sell it. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, a guild negotiator, said the union will ask <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> to maintain the money-losing company as a `` general, international news'' organization. The company has about 1,400 employees after laying off about 100 people in recent month. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> WSG </ORGANIZATION> and its parent, The Newspaper Guild, met for about an hour and a half with <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> described the meeting as `` businesslike.'' The guild asked for a copy of the financial deal between WNW and <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> as well as use of the company's internal message wire for guild purposes. <ORGANIZATION> WSG </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> told <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> work force is unsettled because of the fequent turmoil, and allowing the union to communicate with staffers on a timely basis would boost morale, he said. <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> said he could not guarantee there would not be layoffs in the future, but he noted a freeze was in effect, a WSG statement said. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s executive editor, said `` morale has soared'' since the staff learned of the deal. `` I am very optimistic,'' he said. <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON>, a former president of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, has a long career in journalism, mainly the broadcast industry. Before joining <ORGANIZATION> FNN </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, he was a news director of <ORGANIZATION> KING-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and at WIXT-TV in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. A native of <LOCATION> Chillicothe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, he has also worked for <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, between 1969 and 1974, covering events in both <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> He has an MBA from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> was formed in June 1907 by The E.W. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which sold the wire service in 1982 to <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company filed for protection from creditors in April 1985, more than a year before it was bought by <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Challenging Sentencing Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of new sentencing guidelines, ruling that two public defender offices lacked legal standing to bring the case. The decision by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> dismissed the case on technical grounds. It came four days after two federal judges in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had held the new sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional. The two judges in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> ruled that the 1984 law establishing the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was unconstitutional because it improperly placed the panel in the judicial instead of the executive branch in violation of the constitution's separation-of-powers doctrine Unlike the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cases, the suit before <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> did not involve defendants who faced sentencing under the new guidelines, which provide a complicated set of factors for determining the length of a defendant's incarceration. <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> found that federal public defenders' offices in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> lacked legal standing to sue because they could n't show they were harmed by the new sentencing guidelines. `` Permitting lawyers to sue without clients, or at best, with only potential clients, merely because their putatative clients allegedly will be harmed, would open the same door for specialist lawyers to sue whenever <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacts a statute which impacts on their clientele,'' <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> said. `` The harm alleged by plaintiffs ... essentially boils down to their perception that their workload will be more complex and will markedly increase,'' <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> said. `` That sort of ` harm' or ` injury' is no different from the ` harm' that the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 caused for tax laywers, or for that matter than the ` harm' caused for criminal lawyers by the passage of the Bail Reform and Speedy Trial Acts,'' the judge said.

 The kidnappers of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer released a videotape Monday in which he recited their demands, including withdrawal by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from its border `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who appeared to be reading from a text written by his captors, said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has to take responsibility for the crimes he has committed against the oppressed people in the region.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was abducted last Wednesday on a highway south of Tyre, the ancient port 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which claimed responsibility for the abduction, released the 70-second tape. The kidnapping increased friction between two Shiite Moslem forces vying for domination in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>: the moderate Amal militia, which is trying to rescue <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of the 25 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Amal militiamen and troops of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, using dogs, searched the caves and groves of the Tyre area for the sixth day Monday. NBC Nightly News reported `` important progress in the search.'' In a report from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> it said sources there told NBC News the three gunmen who kidnapped <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and three other gunmen who were in the getaway car have been caught. It said the six are being interrogated by Amal officers. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is commander of the 76-man Observer Group-Lebanon attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, the south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> peacekeeping force. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> claimed the 43-year-old Marine from <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was removed from the area despite a dragnet by Amal and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> security officers. Release of the tape, delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, suggested the abductors were able to get <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> out. `` It is hard to believe that a videotape can be produced if the captive is held in a dangerous hideout,'' said an independent, informed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amal, which supports the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> presence in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, views <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction as a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> challenge. Security sources in Tyre said Amal had closed the Iranian cultural center and Iranian Revolutionary Guards offices in the city. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> declared full support for the kidnappers and denounced <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s `` enthusiam to determine the fate of a filthy <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy.'' Nine Americans, including <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, are among the 25 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985. Many of his taped remarks were in poor English, indicating he did not write the message. His face was close to the camera, obscuring any background that might have indicated the location. He appeared physically fit, was unshaven and wore the same dark green sweater as when kidnappers stopped his car on the coastal highway. A typewritten statement in Arabic that accompanied the tape renewed the charge that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent using the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> job as a cover. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has denied this. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday the videotape `` obviously ... was made under duress.'' To begin the statement, the kidnapped <PERSON> Marine </PERSON> said: `` I, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in order to get me released, these demands have to be met.'' He recited the same conditions his captors set forth in a statement on Friday claiming responsibility for the abduction: _ Withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces from the zone they maintain just north of the frontier as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla raids _ Release of all Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas from the <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION> prison and `` all other prisons inside the Zionist regime in occupied Palestine. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> holds about 300 Lebanese and Palestinians at <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION> in the security zone. _ An end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> missions by American emissaries While giving the last condition, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said the aim of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missions to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was to `` surround the gains of the Islamic revolution in occupied Palestine.'' That suggested the kidnappers wanted Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to cancel a scheduled trip this week in which he is to visit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and may go to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday, where the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> situation was figuring in his talks. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> has said 20 officers of <PERSON> Higgings </PERSON>' group were withdrawn from three border posts after his abduction to the force's headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, a Lebanese town just north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border The U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> evacuated its last five foreign employees from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the Christian eastern sector Monday because of the kidnappings Feb. 5 of employees <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reconsider its charges that a Japanese `` scientific research'' whaling expedition in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> is undermining international agreements, the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Ambassador <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> sent Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> a letter accusing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of taking `` unilateral action'' and `` unjustifiable measures'' in the whaling dispute, an embassy statement said. It referred to a Feb. 10 <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declaration that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s killing of minke whales in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> violated international whaling agreements. The declaration means that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by April can order a 50 percent cut in the Japanese fishing quota in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic territorial waters and exclude Japanese fish and fish products from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. The current Japanese fishing quota in the 200-mile offshore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic zone is zero but the declaration could be applied to future years as well as apply to sales of processed fish. <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>'s letter restated the Japanese government position that the current <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> expedition is for non-commercial research `` provided for in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed in 1984 that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would cease commercial whaling in 1987. Critics say that proposed harvest of hundreds of minke whales is excessive for research, that the commission has not specifically authorized the current expedition and that the stated research into whale population, diet and nutrition could be carried out without killing the whales. The Embassy said <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> in his letter, dated Friday, `` strongly urged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to reconsider its position in light of the damage these moves would cause to mutually beneficial U.S.-Japan fishery relations.''

 The saga of the television evangelists has come full circle with the disgrace of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who a year ago was the scourge of lust and greed among the `` pompadour boys'' in the religious broadcasting fraternity. The scandal strikes an electronic church which has already been measurably diminished by last year's controversies over <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s adultery and high living and Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' claim that God might `` take me home'' if he failed to raise $ 8 million by the end of March. `` My feeling is that there will be more damage, and the credibility of those of us in Christian broadcasting will be hurt a little bit more. How much, I do n't know,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, president of National Religious Broadcasters. Rose, of WCFC-TV in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, noted that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had been a vigorous proponent of the <ORGANIZATION> NRB </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to improve financial accountability, as well as an emphatic preacher about sexual morality. `` A lot of people saw <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> as a pacesetter for doing what needed to done in the church, so in this case it is shocking,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in shame a year ago, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> thundered: `` God deliver us from these pompadour boys, hair done, nails done, fresh from the beauty shop, preaching the gospel.'' Even before <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s recent problems, the name-calling among these men of God and the jokes of late-night comedians had moved <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, now a Republican presidential contender, to say that he resented being identified as a `` television evangelist.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> _ by some measures, the biggest of them all _ stepped down from his pulpit Sunday after confessing that he had sinned against <PERSON> God </PERSON> and his family. He did n't explain, but others reported that the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> evangelist had been photographed entering a motel room with a prostitute. `` We're the last surviving ministry, the last one,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> told students at his <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Sunday. `` <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is gone. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is gone ... running for president. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is now gone. We're the last. The credibility crisis is unbelievable.'' With that crisis came hard times for the television ministry. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> all have lost part of their audience, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> laid off nearly 500 employees at his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> last summer and 145 more in November. <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>'s contribution income dropped by 32.5 percent from April to October, said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the ministry's director of communications. Not only did the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> scandal hurt, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, but falling oil prices cut into the income of some supporters and the stock market dived in October. `` There was a real drought for a good bit of last year,'' said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> deMoss </PERSON>, who predicted Monday that there may be little or no impact this time. `` Part of that is due to the way <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has handled his admission of wrongdoing,'' <PERSON> deMoss </PERSON> said. `` I think another reason for that is, thanks in great part to the media, the general public now has a better understanding of the difference between a charismatic and non-charismatic ministry and now is able to tell the difference from one ministry to another. `` I look at the example of a <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> moral failure _ that did not ruin the Democratic party or other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates, but it did ruin <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> deMoss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, Moral Majority's founder, is an independent Baptist and a fundamentalist. Charismatics may share his Biblical literalism, but they emphasize `` gifts of the spirit'' such as speaking in tongues and healing. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> were both ordained by the Assemblies of God, a charismatic denomination. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had a larger audience, 1,720,000 households per week last November, than any other video evangelist, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> rating service. The <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> put <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s audience at 860,000 households, second to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>'s 1,189,000, but <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was seen on the most stations, <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s audience had been 2,161,000 households in February of last year, before the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> controversies. Between February and November last year, <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>'s audience dropped from 1.7 million households to 1.4 million, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> from 1.15 million to 900,000, and <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s `` Old Time Gospel Hour'' from 616,000 to 495,000. Those figures are for broadcast audience only; most programs reach additional viewers on cable television. The negative publicity started last year when <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who had built an evangelistic empire including a university and a hospital in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, announced that God might `` call me home'' if he did not raise $ 8 million by the end of March. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned March 19, 1987, after admitting a sexual encounter with a young woman later identified as <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> to take over, but later claimed that <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> had stolen PTL. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his top aide, the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, were subsequently defrocked by the Assemblies of God. The story popped up through the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> feuded with <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who finally resigned in frustration in October. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> turned up in the pages of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>, and in the mansion of <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>. In December, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> had been paid $ 9.36 million in excessive compensation between 1981 and 1987. This month, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s new trustee, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, filed suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and former aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, seeking $ 52.8 million for mismanagement and unjustified compensation. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s 81-year-old parents, <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Furnia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, were laid off last week from their $ 500-a-month jobs as greeters at the <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> resort, where they have continued to live. This month, members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> adopted a financial code of ethics which will require public disclosure of annual, independent audits of all income and expenditures, except for salaries.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The army chief of staff denied Monday night that the commander of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most repressive and powerful batallion is involved in cocaine trafficking. `` There has been no complaint or judicial file received implicating Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who has been singled out by the foreign press'' for denigration, read the communique signed by Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> and broadcast by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is the target of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand jury probe based on the testimony of <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> informant who charged that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> uses his private airstrip and ranch outside <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> to smuggle cocaine from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The army statement refuted the `` so-called involvement of -LRB- <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- in affairs of drug trafficking,'' and denounced the foreign press for its `` campaign of denigration'' against <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who is in his late 40s. The statement also warned the local press not to repeat `` unfounded rumors'' of the foreign press. Several opposition newspapers reported with banner headlines a news conference given by <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last week implicating <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as a cocaine smuggler. The communique stated that if the army high command has reason to believe that any army officer is guilty of misconduct, `` an investigating committee will be created, in accordance with the regulations of the Armed Forces of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s unit, the widely feared <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>, is responsible for virtually all army repression and killings of demonstrators in 1987. Soldiers from the 700-man batallion were also seen in the streets during the violently-aborted Nov. 29 elections, apparerently protecting gunmen who shot or hacked to death at least 34 voters.

<HEAD>Dublin Government To Launch Own Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former parish priest of an Irish nationalist who was shot dead from an army observation tower said Monday that police and soldiers harrassed the victim for several years. British officials said they have launched an investigation into the incident Sunday in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> near the Irish border. But in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government announced it will hold its own probe headed by the deputy Irish police chief. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s death came at a time of severe strain in Anglo-Irish relations over other incidents involving the police and the province's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. The Rev. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> had to cross the Irish border daily to go to work and was constantly harassed at the army checkpoint. `` We complained time out of number to the police and military, but no action was ever taken. Life for the poor man had just become unbearable,'' he told reporters. The army said it `` deeply regrets'' the shooting. It said 23-year-old <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was hit by a bullet fired from an army observation post about half a mile from the Irish border in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. Police said the soldier involved was in military custody while an investigation was launched. No details about the soldier were given. Police declined to comment on the priest's allegations of harassment. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said security sources reported that the soldier involved told detectives a machine gun was accidentally discharged as he handed it to another soldier. The agency also quoted unidentified sources as saying three strike marks were found on the roadway near the victim, indicating three shots might have been fired. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, said of the investigation announced by the <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> government: `` We welcome any attempt to bring the murderer of <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> to real justice and ensure that there is not yet another cover-up. `` Maybe at this late stage the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government will finally recognize the reality of families like ourselves having to put up with constant harassment. ... In the light of recent developments of incidents here -LRB- in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> -RRB- I do not think anyone would be prepared to give evidence to the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> _ is <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force Its policemen are frequent targets of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> gunmen and bombers. Allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> tried to thwart an investigation into the slaying of six unarmed Catholics by an <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> unit in 1982 has intensified the deep hostility among many Catholics toward the force. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Relatives said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was walking to a regular weekly Gaelic football game in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>, when he was shot. He had passed through the checkpoint, which lies on the route to the football ground. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON>, a local councilman, said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was an election worker for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, political arm of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> denied <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was among their members. <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was never involved in paramilitary activity but was harassed nevertheless. `` He was never abused physically, just verbally, and his car was often taken apart,'' <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said, referring to vehicle searches. `` I do n't know why he was singled out for such treatment.'' `` The campaign against him must have been going on for at least five years. Other young lads were also stopped, but <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> appeared to be getting special treatment,'' he said. Last month <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> provoked Irish outrage by saying it will not prosecute policemen accused of perverting the course of justice in the aftermath of the killing of six unarmed Catholics in three incidents in late 1982. The strain was compounded by a British appeals court's refusal to overturn the conviction of six Irishmen accused of perpetrating twin bombings that killed 21 people in 1974. Many Irish officials and civilians believe the six are victims of a miscarriage of justice.

 Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Monday that `` somebody planned'' the eruption of a scandal involving television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> two weeks before the Super Tuesday primaries. But he would n't say who he was talking about. `` Nothing happens to people by accident,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former television evangelist, said in an interview Monday with the <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, Independent-Mail. `` It is kind of funny this came up two weeks before the most important primaries in the nation. People probably wonder what went on.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> temporarily stepped down from the pulpit of his 7,500-member church in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, on Sunday amid allegations of sexual misconduct. `` I think somebody had something to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` Somebody else planned all these things, I am afraid.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> declined to say who he was referring to, but said the `` political efforts'' will have little effect on his campaign because his supporters back him too strongly. `` It -LRB- the scandal -RRB- will not affect me because it has nothing whatsoever to do with me,'' he told the newspaper. `` But I want to tell people to ask -LRB- Vice President -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what he thinks about all this.'' Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had said the troubles <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is having are `` unfortunate,'' but that he did n't think the controversy would have any effect on his campaign. `` It will have no more effect on me than <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> had on <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> dropped out of the Democratic presidential race in May amid reports of his relationship with a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> model, then rejoined the field in December. In the interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of `` dirty politics'' and `` trickery'' directed at his campaign, but offered no proof of such activity. `` I have been told of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s dirty tricks and I expect to see them in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` His campaign will use every kind of dirty trick against me because this state is important and I have a lot of support and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials were not immediately available to respond to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s comments. Also on Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> called for a return to teaching methods used 40 years ago, when children could still pray in public schools. Back then, `` We maybe did n't have some of the fancy buildings and we were n't spending $ 270 billion a year on education, but little children could pray in the public schools of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and we've got to see that once again,'' he said to applause from a group of about 800 people at <ORGANIZATION> Lander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in recent math tests, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students performed just above students in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. `` Twenty-five percent of the students in one test could n't even locate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on a map. How can you defend a country when you do n't even know where it is?'' He said American education should once again stress the basics such as the multiplication tables, science, geography and American history.

<HEAD>Sources Say Switchman In Amtrak Accident Tested Positive For Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> switchman who fled his post after a derailment injured 25 passengers last month has tested positive for marijuana and at least one other drug, officials familiar with the tests said Monday night. However, one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities had not determined whether a link existed between the Jan. 29 accident and the results of the tests on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Aldan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. He said the laboratory that performed the tests has been asked to clarify the analysis, and the correlation remained `` an open issue.'' He said he could not identify any other drugs that had been found. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> was the control tower operator on duty when the train slammed into a work vehicle in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He fled his post after realizing he had failed to take the train off a stretch of track undergoing maintenance. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> did not submit to blood or urine tests until more than 72 hours after the accident. Marijuana can remain in the system for up to 30 days. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he had not been notified of the results. `` I do n't believe it,'' <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> said, referring to the sources' report <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the railroad also had not been informed of the results. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nightly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday night that sources had found <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> tested positive for high amounts of marijuana, cocaine and a third unidentified drug. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said he could neither comfirm nor deny any reports about the drug tests, pending notification to <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> did confirm that the results had been received and said the railroad administration expected to issue a report on Tuesday. He said the findings were `` not simple.'' <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> was suspended without pay by <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, then resigned last week, citing `` physical and emotional stress.'' Calls to <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>'s home were not answered Monday night.

 Move over Maybellene. Roll over <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is hail, hail, hailing rock' n' roll legend <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. The critically-acclaimed movie, `` Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock' n' Roll,'' led the pack of American films forming the centerpiece of this year's <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Film Festival. And <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, the father of rock' n' roll who inspired such musicians as <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and the Beatles, was the American star feted first at this year's event, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s No. 2 annual cinema extravaganza after the more prestigious Cannes Film Festival. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> was presented with a life achievement award at the West German premier of `` Hail! Hail! Rock' n' Roll,'' the movie directed by <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackford </PERSON> -LRB- `` White Nights,'' `` An Officer and a Gentleman'' -RRB- that made its American debut at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in the fall. The Berlinale Camera award, a gold replica of a camera, was presented to <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> at the premiere by <PERSON> Voker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Senator for Cultural Affairs `` I do n't consider myself a legend,'' the 62-year-old <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` I always thought a legend was a dead person who is praised.'' The St. Louis-born <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> wrote such hard-hitting, foot stomping songs as `` Maybellene,'' `` Sweet Little Sixteen,'' `` School Day,'' `` Hail! Hail! Rock' n' Roll,'' `` Roll Over Beethoven'' and `` Rock' n' Roll Music.'' The movie, a two-hour biographical concert show, is the sixth film in which the rock star has appeared. It features <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON>, as a back-up singer, blues singer <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and pop star <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> Rolling Stones guitarist <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the film's musical producer, also makes an appearance. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> is known for his stage showmanship, from the skillfull handling of the guitar to his flashy dance improvisations. It is this stage savvy that sets him apart from other performers, he says. `` There's a special sense that I think I have as a performer,'' he said. `` I know when I have to change the pace, when I see the audience looking tired.'' But age has forced him to change his performance over the years, he says. `` As you get older and older, you find out what's better to do'' he said. `` Over the last 10 years the dancing in my shows has diminished, but the presence has developed.'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> was a hit with both older and younger fans in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. He was mobbed by throngs of fans and autograph seekers upon arriving at the city's <LOCATION> Tegel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and a sold-out crowd gathered to see him perform at the `` Metropole,'' one of the city's hottest night spots. But the singer says he's had enough fame. `` I do n't care for any more fame than I had a few years ago,'' said <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, who cut a lean, lithe figure in his light blue vest and string tie. `` I do n't think I really deserve it.'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said he owes his skills as a lyricist to his early exposure to poetry. `` I grew up with poetry'' he said. `` From the time I was 8 years old, I'd be learning different poems. It was a family thing. My older sisters and I would have contests to see who could tell the best poems.'' In recent years the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> has favored splashy, Hollywood-style productions after years of honoring art-oriented works of little commercial draw. This year's offerings included `` Broadcast News,'' `` Wall Street,'' `` Walker'' and `` Moonstruck.'' Some 750 short and feature-length films from more than 100 nations were shown during the 11-day festival, which ended Feb. 23. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` September'' kicked off the festival.

 If loyal fans of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Moonlighting'' are gluttons for punishment, that may be an asset for watching the show this season. Not within memory have television viewers had to put up with so much and gotten so little. `` Moonlighting'' is the most disappointing show this season, and for those who loved the show it is a terrible thing to see it self-destruct right on the screen. What made this show go, what gave it its charm and appeal, were the scenes between <LOCATION> Cybill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shepherd </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>. These two opposites, irresistibly drawn to each other in a love-hate relationship, made the screen sparkle with their witty repartee. But Shepherd's pregnancy caused a dilemma for the show's producers Instead of shooting around it, as most series do, they made it a part of the story. <PERSON> Allyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, who plays Miss Dipesto, was also pregnant, but on the show she ignored it. Besides, with her layered look, it was hard to tell. It might have seemed a smart move at the time to incorporate Shepherd's pregnancy into the story. But it has turned into labor for the viewers. <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON>, telling no one she was pregnant, went off to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to brood with her parents. <PERSON> David </PERSON> was left to deal with her absence. `` Moonlighting'' was left to slowly twist in the wind. It was embarrassing watching the show deal with her absence. It squirmed and made up stories like someone caught in a lie. The whole point of watching `` Moonlighting'' was to see those two carry on like <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> in `` Woman of the Year.'' The cases they solved were merely an excuse to get them together so they could disagree. And when <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> finally got back together, it was n't any better. Forget the witty dialogue. `` Moonlighting'' turned into `` Days of Whine and Roses.'' Although <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> had twins, <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON> is still pregnant. She told <PERSON> David </PERSON> the baby's not his. But the clincher was when she announced she had married a stranger _ a whole new character, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> as a businessman she met on the train from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ on impulse. <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON>, married on impulse? <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON>, the woman who would n't cross the street on impulse? <PERSON> David </PERSON> is standing there with egg on his face, trying to grin through it. What a low blow. What a letdown for the audience. Where is the famous `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' shower when we need it? Tell us the season was only a dream and not a nightmare. <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> have become an unfunny, bickering couple who have overstayed their welcome. It was nice while it lasted, but the magic is gone. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has removed another show from its schedule. `` Sledge Hammer!'' a spoof on all those macho detectives, started out in the <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> cellar and never got out. The show deserved better. It made its debut in September 1986 against <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Miami Vice.'' After that introduction to obscurity, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> transferred the show to 8 o'clock Thursday, where it went up against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show.'' There it stayed until it was moved again, back to Friday against `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Miami Vice.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasche </PERSON> stars as the title character, a one-man anti-crime crusade, whose idea of crime prevention is shooting a jaywalker. The show has parodied such movies as `` Vertigo,'' `` Play It Again, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' `` A Clockwork Orange,'' `` Dressed To Kill'' and `` Robocop.'' It's a funny show, although its brand of satire may be difficult for some people to understand. But the main reason the show never gained an audience was its time period. It has never had a chance. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> says it will bring the show back later. It deserves a chance to be seen by a wider audience and not merely to be brought back in another bad time slot to play out its commitment.

 It is n't easy to make a rhinoceros look noble, tragic, even charming, but producer-writer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayford </PERSON> does just that in his stunning National Geographic special, `` The Rhino War.'' `` That was part of what I was trying to do, tried to make them look attractive, tried to make them look cuddly, because they're not very cuddly and attractive, and they're not very appealable, but they can be,'' said <LOCATION> Cayford </LOCATION>, a British filmmaker and conservationist, during a recent visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The one-hour documentary, shot in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> last year, airs Sunday on SuperStation TBS. It is narrated by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> and features music by <PERSON> Ladysmith </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Mombazo </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cayford </LOCATION> has serious reasons for doing rhino PR. Of the more than 30 species of rhinoceros that once existed on the African continent, only five remain, and all are endangered, especially the black rhino. In the early 1970s, there were 65,000 rhinos in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Now there are 4,500. Says a park ranger in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, `` You do not want to show to your children one day how an elephant or a rhino look in a storybook.'' `` Ironically,'' notes Cayford in the film's narration, `` the very feature that evolved for the animal's defense may bring about its extinction.'' Poachers are killing rhinos for the horn. A rhino's horn is caratin, like a human fingernail. The easiest way to remove it is to kill the animal. Contrary to popular belief, rhino horn powder is not primarily sought as an aphrodisiac, but rather in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as a supposed fever reducer. More recently, however, conservationists uncovered an alarming new market for much of the rhino horn _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, where rhino-horn dagger handles are symbols of virility that command up to $ 15,000. In the oil-rich country, there is plenty of money for such extravangances. In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the battle to save the rhino has in fact become a war, complete with soldiers, helicopters, guns and death. The enemies, notes Cayford, are `` greed, corruption and ignorance.'' In <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, where armed poachers moved after virtually wiping out the rhinos in eastern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the government has given park rangers authority to shoot to kill poachers. Cayford's cameras capture the rangers' exhilaration after a violent confrontation. A dead poacher is juxtaposed with grim eloquence against the carcass of a rhino. Since 1985, more than 30 poachers have died. So have 330 rhinos. The rangers say they do n't like to kill humans to save animals, but feel the decision is a moral one. The poachers are on the short end of the economic stick. They risk their lives for a few hundred dollars. The middlemen who smuggle the horns out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> make thousands. <PERSON> Cayford </PERSON> says that despite their frightening appearance, rhinos are peaceful beings. Nevertheless, the filmmakers are seen rapidly retreating when one trots toward them. Cayford knows humans ca n't resist baby animals, even rhinos. One baby who was savaged by lions is seen on a preserve for orphaned and injured animals, trotting about with his loyal new friend, a spritely sheep. `` He was sweet,'' said <PERSON> Cayford </PERSON>. `` I saw him a couple of months ago, and he's doing fine.'' For conservationists, it is an uphill battle to convince Africans who are struggling to develop their countries that saving wildlife should be a priority. Africans themselves are beginning to take up the cause. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Werikhe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> walks across his country promoting wildlife conservation. `` It's time wildlife awareness was taken to the people,'' he says. `` It's them who have the final say.'' `` There is concern, sure there's concern,'' <PERSON> Cayford </PERSON> said. `` It just takes time. At the time people were wiping out the bison, nobody cared very much. `` What you have to do is come to the country understanding the country's problems, and helping rather than preaching,'' he said. `` You show them how wildlife has an economic value, that if you look after wildlife by doing this, this and this, it's going to bring you a natural benefit, that it's not something just to preserve for its own sake, which is a nice idea, but it only works when you can afford it.'' At the conclusion of the film, the camera pans from a rhino standing majestically on a ridge to the tall fence that he faces. If the rhino war is lost by the conservationists, the narration says, `` the rhino will be doomed to exist in a child's picture book of things that once were, but are no more.''

<HEAD>Activists Claim Human Rights Violations More Subtle in Chile</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Open violence against dissidents is now rare in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, but specialists contend that widespread human rights violations continue in more subtle ways and often are cloaked in apparent legality. The 14-year-old military government of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who also is the army commander, `` has modernized'' its repression methods, claims <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garreton </PERSON>, chief lawyer for the Vicariate of Solidarity, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights agency. <PERSON> Garreton </PERSON> and other lawyers and human rights activists contend that the military regime has succeeded in politically neutralizing many dissidents by fear, making violent repression no longer necessary. Speaking in interviews, they said that although torture is still common, the government has developed other, more subtle methods, including the continued enforcement of a nationwide state of emergency that empowers it to severely curtail basic civil rights. The government has also issued a number of specially tailored decrees and laws that give a formal legality to repression and ensure impunity to many human rights violators, the specialists maintain. As an example, they cited the widenening scope of military justice. During the last two years, 95 percent of those tried by military courts were civilians, according to <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hales </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hales </PERSON> said 90 percent of those tried were eventually freed without charges, but most of them were kept incommunicado for long periods, sometimes up to 40 days. The specialists contended that repression now often works through indimidation and threat, including the action of several shadowy, right-wing extremist groups that kidnap, beat up and occasionally even kill people. Authorities deny any connection with such groups and have promised to investigate. Nearly 200 Chileans claim to have received death threats in recent months from the extremist groups, including some well known dissidents, and many have been briefly kidnapped and physically abused. One group, the September 11 Commando, took responsibility for the killing of five leftists the day after a bloody but unsuccsessful attempt to kill <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in 1986. Five young Communists have been missing since September, and a group called Chilean Anti-Communist Action claimed responsibility Feb. 15 for their abduction and disappearance. These methods `` have an extremely paralyzing and brutally frightening effect on most people,'' said <PERSON> Garreton </PERSON>. Lawyers and human rights activists, including <PERSON> Hales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garreton </PERSON>, said they are convinced that those groups are `` centralized'' and connected to official security services. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON>, research director of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said `` threatening is the new tactic for repression.'' The critics point out that, although most cases remain unsolved, every time a member of one of those groups was discovered, he proved to be a member of the military or the security services. An army lieutenant, <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, was killed three years ago by a bomb he was planting at a church in the southern city of <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arenas </LOCATION>. A number of leaflets of the Chilean Anti-Communist Action group were found at the site. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Volio </PERSON>, a Costa Rican who is the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' officially designated human rights inspector for <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, has denounced the existence of the extremist groups Unless they are dismantled, he said, `` this society will remain torn apart.'' In the years after <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and the military seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, hundreds of leftist dissidents were killed, and at least 683 cases of political prisoners who disappeared have been documented by local and foreign human rights groups. The torture of prisoners was considered widespread. Summary executions have long since ceased and arbitrary arrests have decreased sharply. According to figures gathered by the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, 33,903 people were arbitrarily arrested in 1986, while the figure went down to 6,255 in 1987. The commission registered 106 cases of torture of dissidents in 1987, compared to 290 a year earlier. The commission's <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON> stressed in an interview that `` we have never had a single report proved unfounded. We are extremely rigorous. There are many claims we do not publish for lack of evidence.'' Since the 1973 coup, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regularly has issued reports that are highly critical of the Chilean government. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has also been critical of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in its annual country-by-country report submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. This year's reports by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, while still critical, noted an improvement in the general situation of human rights here. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report mentioned continued torture of prisoners. The government rejected the reports. An official statement said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report `` reflects only a partial picture of reality, ... has errors and mentions some facts that have not been proved.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Varas </PERSON>, secretary of a government-appointed <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report shows `` a lack of knowledge of the Chilean situation.'' The government also complains that its critics fail to refer to terrorism by leftist guerrilla groups when discussing the human rights situation. Human rights activists criticize government legislation they contend is tailored to curb dissent. They cite the 1980 Constitution, which outlaws `` totalitarian doctrines,'' such as Marxism, and an amnesty law that they claim favors scores of human rights violators. They also cite the nationwide state of emergency and widened state of siege legislation that severely curtail civil rights and grant authorities wide powers to supress dissent, including the exile of dissidents, banning of public meetings, censorship of the mail and communications and restrictions of freedom of the press and of labor unions.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s system of education, admired worldwide f, time-proven methods, has become a source of concern in French homes, where it is increasinglyor its rigorous regarded as a misfit in the modern world. To its critics of the late 1980s, it is like a fine old car on a superhighway; it still works and still draws `` ahs'' but needs a tune-up, or an overhaul, to keep up with the traffic. `` The fundamental problems with French education is that it is an extremely selective system and leaves aside too large a proportion of youth who do n't finish their studies,'' said <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> of the government-run Center for the Stuy 42 to 43 percent of French students finish high school and only about 22 to 23 percent go on to higher studies at a university or a prestigious `` grande ecole,'' according to <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON>. About 46 percent of French students receive what is known as `` professional formation'' for a specific trade, be it in a hospital or a bakery. `` We are conscious these levels are no longer adapted to the economic and social needs of today,'' said <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON>. `` If you compare it to countries like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, we are far behind.'' The Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to promote economic and social development in its 19 member countries, agrees with the system's critics. `` The education system is geared toward helping the academically inclined. It is in fact a highly selective system which eliminates the weaker pupils at each different level and tends to brand them as losers,'' it said in a 1984 report on youth employment in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The `` grandes ecoles'' perhaps represent the ultimate example of selection in the education system. Since the 18th century, higher education in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has been dominated by the elite, specialized schools _ not universities _ which turn out the future leaders of government and industry. One of the `` grandes ecoles'' is the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Administration </ORGANIZATION>, whose graduates have a near-monopoly on top jobs in the government bureaucracy and figure prominently in politics. Another is <PERSON> L'Ecole </PERSON> <PERSON> Polytechnique </PERSON>, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which turns out most of the nation's top engineers, many of whom become chief executives in state-owned or private industries. Looking toward a more competitive continent when the European Economic Community's open border policy starts in 1992, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is scrutinizing its education system and finding it heading for, or already in, a state of crisis. Students ill-prepared for the job market, a lack of funds, a top-heavy structure and an aging, diminishing university teaching corps are among other problems. A government-ordered report on university professors, released Feb. 18, spoke of the `` vertiginous degradation'' of their lot, in pay, lack of work incentives and mediocre working conditions. For the student, the lot is determined in a process of selection, with the first at about age 13 based on performance in French and mathematics. Universities present the opposite problem: any student with a baccalaureate from high school can enter. There is almost universal agreement that the 78 state-run universities need to be reformed, but successive governments have faced a student broadside in trying to do so. `` For the past 20 years, the university has been the sick man of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' said the newsweekly Le Point in a cover story on universities. While 80 percent of university graduates find jobs within 10 months of receiving diplomas, 70 percent of the jobs are either administrative or not in the graduate's field. Even critics of the system say a student who passes the baccalaureat, the several-days-long exam at the end of high school, is better equipped academically than an American high school graduate. But, according to current thinking, the student is not necessarily better prepared to meet the requirements of the job market. `` It is generally charged that national education is lagging behind in comparison with the needs of companies,'' <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> said. `` In the universities, teaching is mainly theory,'' said a 24-year-old doctoral student, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillochet </PERSON>. `` When you leave, you have lots in your head but you do n't know how to do anything.'' Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, a presidential candidate in spring elections, was confronted with the issue by an unemployed 24-year-old university graduate during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Reims </LOCATION>. French education, the premier told the woman, has trained too many people `` in abstract subjects for theoretical jobs.'' `` It's too general. It does not give the technical expertise our businesses demand. Our enterprises need more and more people with technical knowledge.'' Said Bertand: `` The big idea now is ` alternance,' going alternatively to school then a company for training, like in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to get both theory and experience.''

 They worshipped in village homes at night. They hid the symbols of their foreign faith inside <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> altars and images. These were times when their discovery could mean torture or death. They were Japanese who became Christians after St. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1549-1551. Today, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Christians worship freely, but they cherish their secret past. Some 13,000 of the nation's 1 million or so Christians continue the tradition of secret worship, mostly on remote islands in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Most are the elderly who do so out of habit rather than out of fear. And now artifacts of the secret-Christian era, many collected by a woman who once worshipped secretly herself, soon will be displayed in a museum here in <LOCATION> Oiso </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese embraced Christianity under Jesuit and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leadership in the 16th century, when Western influence was first felt in their isolated archipelago. The government banned what it regarded as a disruptive foreign religion after Europeans were expelled from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1639. In periodic persecutions, suspected Christians were forced to recant, or be tortured, crucified or burned at the stake. But Christians continued to worship privately for more than 200 years, and during that time, Japanese Christianity acquired a unique flavor. The hundreds of statues and scrolls already collected by the museum at <PERSON> Oiso </PERSON> attest to the ambiguity of religion in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where adherents to various faiths have customarily mixed Christian, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> and Shinto rituals to mark the major turning points in their lives. As the Christians originally concentrated in <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> gradually spread throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, they preserved symbols of their faith in hidden ways, said <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>, the curator of the museum's collection `` Carpenters built crosses into <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples,'' he said. `` They worshipped symbols of fish and family crests that were shaped like crosses, and other Japanese did n't guess those were also Christian symbols. `` In one temple, the walls were studded with cross-shaped windows, but the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- priests had no idea they were made by Christians.'' The secret Christians took advantage of this lack of awareness and of the close similarity of the <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> god of mercy. They painted on their breasts tiny gold crucifixes that apparently passed unnoticed. The back of one artifact, a statue of a Japanese warrior-god brandishing a spear, opens to reveal an ivory and gold crucifix. Other statues have false bottoms, with crosses and icons inside. <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>, 71, was a close friend of <PERSON> Miki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawada </PERSON>, the woman who collected the treasures and the granddaughter of the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> industrial empire. After her death in 1980, <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> and others raised the funds for the museum, on the peaceful, forested grounds of the orphanage Mrs. <PERSON> Sawada </PERSON> founded in <LOCATION> Oiso </LOCATION>, 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Born into a strict <PERSON> Buddhist </PERSON> family, she learned of Christianity from a nurse when she was 8 years old and worshipped secretly until her 18th birthday, when she was allowed to attend a church service for the first time. She eventually married a Christian and devoted her life and wealth to helping others, establishing the <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> Home for orphans. The orphanage was named after an impoverished British woman living in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who contributed her life savings, $ 170, to help establish it. For 40 years, Mrs. <PERSON> Sawada </PERSON> visited communities where secret Christians once lived, collecting their treasures, which are being housed in a tiny chapel before the museum's opening in April. `` These items are priceless,'' said <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>, gingerly uncovering what looks like a metal plate but turns out to be a magic mirror. `` There is only one man in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who can still make these mirrors.'' Bright light reflected in the rather dull surface of the 16th century mirror casts the shadow of Christ on the cross. To police seeking out Christians at the time, the mirror was just a mirror, but for the secret worshipers, it was a precious symbol of their faith. The prohibition on Christianity, enforced sporadically, was lifted when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> reopened its door to the West in 1854. Under the militaristic governments during World War II, however, Christianity again became suspect. Some secret Christians willingly worshipped both <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> and Christian deity. Others, forced to demonstrate their piety at temples and shrines, directed their prayers toward crosses etched secretly by other Christians into woodwork or hidden behind <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> altars. When Japanese pray at shrines and temples, they usually clap twice. The Christians would clap once again, the third clap a reminder of the Holy Trinity, <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> said. `` During the war, when <PERSON> Christianity </PERSON> was considered subversive, we used to clap the third clap very quietly,'' he said. Christianity, however, has set down few roots in this syncretic nation, and today attracts less than 1 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 121 million people. Less than half the Japanese people profess devotion to any faith, but Japanese life is still dominated by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> and Shinto rites, and most homes have <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> altars for prayers to dead family members. The Christians still living in remote villages in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, who say prayers in an incomprehensible form of pidgin Japanese, are continuing a tradition that is dying elsewhere, <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> said.

 You ca n't look at <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colmans </PERSON>' book, but you can read it. The book _ on using computers in public relations and related fields _ was written on computer by people contacted via computer, edited on computer and published on computer. And since it exists only in the memory of a computer in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the book can only be read by using a computer. `` The essence of the book is to share information on the ` this is how I do it' use of technology in the communications arts,'' said <PERSON> Colmans </PERSON>, vice president of an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> public relations firm. <PERSON> Colmans </PERSON> is one of about six `` system operators'' of a computer network called the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Along with co-editor <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he has compiled the book over about four years. In it are chapters written by the public information officer for <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who tells how he has set up a computer network to tell citizens what is happening in the city; discussions of `` voice mail,'' a sophisticated, computer-operated telephone answering and message system; and numerous other aspects of how to use technology in the field. The computer book, which would be about an inch thick if printed, is better than one on paper, <PERSON> Colmans </PERSON> said, because `` once you buy a hardcopy book and put it on the shelf, that's it for eternity _ whatever's in the book is the information.'' `` With an on-line book, not only are you not stuck with having to have all the information sitting on your shelf, ... but the minute something becomes obsolete, bang, it's gone. And the minute something comes in that's interesting and new, in a matter of a couple minutes it's on line and available for everybody to see,'' he said. The book _ with the official title of `` The Functional Use of Computers in Public Relations, <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION>'' _ is a true creature of electronics. `` Virtually the entire book was brought together through electronic mail messages and sharing of text as opposed to voice communication,'' <PERSON> Colmans </PERSON> said. `` There were very few phone calls. ... The book itself was created in an electronic communications environment. I have met, face to face, about six of the 40 to 50 people that I communicate with electronically. Most of them are just type on a screen to me,'' he said. Colmans is not your average computer hacker, sitting in front of a terminal, wrapped up in the nuts and bolts, or bits and bytes, of technology. `` About five years ago, I started getting interested in computers to help me do my work, not just to play with, because I'm one of those people that ca n't write a program,'' he said `` I do n't know how a computer works any more than I know how a television set works. But I do know how to turn on a TV and I do know how to turn on a computer.'' In compiling the book, <PERSON> Colmans </PERSON> said, `` the big issue that we discovered was, and still is today, that there are so many kinds of computers out on the market and there's a real lack of understanding among computer users that ... you can actually get those computers to talk to each other.'' Because the book has not been published in the traditional sense, <PERSON> Colmans </PERSON> earns nothing from the people who use it. `` We have not done this project to make money; we've done this project to share information,'' he said, although there has been some discussion about publishing a `` hardcopy of the book'' in the future.

<HEAD>South African Mixed-Race Leader Makes a Comeback</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, a mixed-race politician and member of President <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s Cabinet, defied apartheid laws more than a year ago and went swimming at a whites-only beach. Then at <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s demand, he apologized. Doubts immediately arose that the highly regarded <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> would ever regain credibility among his non-white constituents. But he has made a remarkable comeback. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> now is recognized as perhaps the only elected official in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with both the will and the power to defy the president. As leader of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s mixed-race chamber, he is in a position to force <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the polls next year, three years earlier than it would like. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> he needs consent from all three chambers of Parliament to delay the election from 1989 to 1992. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 76 of 85 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, says he wo n't acquiesce unless <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> abandons the government's policy of segregated neighborhoods This demand is unlikely to be met and has resulted in <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>'s forced resignation from the Cabinet. But the confrontation appears to have boosted his popularity among the country's 3 million `` coloreds,'' as mixed-race South Africans are called. `` Suddenly a lot of people who were disinterested or antagonistic are now realizing that you can find yourself in a position of altering the course of history in this country,'' <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, 60, said at a recent news briefing. `` It does give you and the people you represent a feeling of importance.'' <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>'s political fortunes have seesawed since he helped found the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1969. He was detained for two months in 1976 for his anti-apartheid stance, but came under fire from activists in 1984 when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> agreed to participate in a new tricameral Parliament setup. Chambers for Asians and coloreds were created to join the dominant white chamber, although the nation's black majority remained excluded. The Asian and mixed-race chambers are allowed to handle their `` own affairs'' _ deciding to how to allocate public funding for their own communities, for example. But the 1984 constitution gives the majority party in the white chamber almost total power to set national policy and to override even combined opposition from the other chambers. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> said he would cooperate with the new system for five years in an effort to dismantle apartheid from within. Activists nonetheless denounced him as a sellout for joining <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s Cabinet as minister without portfolio. `` Our participation within the system must not be construed as an acceptance of the system,'' said <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>. `` We walk the difficult road of being in and yet being out.'' In January 1987, the portly politician made a seemingly bold challenge of the government by wading into the surf at a whites-only beach in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, in a televised speech, furiously ordered <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> to apologize or quit the Cabinet. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> apologized. `` It was a demolition job with such humiliation for Rev. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> that he is unlikely to recover from it,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastrow </PERSON>, chairman of the white opposition <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said at the time. Now, white liberals applaud <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>'s tougher tactics and are considering possible alliances with his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> still has many detractors, including activists who totally reject the tricameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist, predominantly mixed-race school, <PERSON> Rector </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>'s resurgence had been `` a non-event.'' The pro-government media also has been critical, for different reasons. The Citizen, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper, maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had become `` fractious and militant'' after being set on a `` dangerous collision course'' by <PERSON> Hendricske </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> says he holds no personal animosity toward <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> but is clearly pleased at having found an effective means of challenging him. `` It's not a question of personal power or strength, but rather a recognition of the correctness of the decision to participate -LRB- in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' he said. `` In spite of the constitutional inadequacies, we were able to find a gap, a weakness, and thus find ourselves in a powerful position.'' In addition to his leverage over the election schedule, <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> has blocked a government proposal to begin joint debates among the three parliamentary chambers. Without joint voting and other reforms, the change is meaningless, <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> maintains. Regardless of whether the white election is delayed, <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> wants mixed-race elections to proceed as scheduled next year. Only 30 percent of colored voters went to the polls in 1984, when activists urged a boycott, and <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> says the turnout next year could rise to 50 percent. He said pro-government forces are seeking to weaken him by dividing his party. Allegations have surfaced that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials tried to bribe <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members into deserting him. There is speculation that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> may retire soon, and <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> has raised an intriguing scenario regarding the choice of a successor by the electoral college. The college consists of 50 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, 25 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, and 13 members from the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> chamber's majority party. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and mixed-race electors could thwart the selection of a hardliner if they could persuade seven or more relatively liberal Nationalists to join them in electing a moderate, such as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> `` Pik'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, no relation to the president. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> was raised in Uitenhage, near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, the fifth child of a Congregational minister. He grew up in an integrated neighborhood and became a minister himself. In 1971, the mixed-race community was forced to move to a colored township under terms of the Group Areas Act, which mandates segregated neighborhoods. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> has described his father's anguish as he watched their home and church being destroyed Now, he wants the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to abolish the Group Areas Act and says he has done enough compromising.

<HEAD>Two Centrist Candidates Hold Edge in Venezuelan Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fourteen candidates of various political hues are in the race for <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s presidency, but polls give two centrists the leading edge so far in the campaign for December's balloting. A former anti-government guerrilla hopes to become a serious third option, but the other 11 candidates are given little chance. One of the centrists is <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who is known as `` The Tiger.'' The other is <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a former president who has been matching practically every every campaign promise <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> has made. The former guerrilla is <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Petkoff </PERSON>, a Socialist. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> represent the two political parties that have dominated Venezuelan politics since dictator <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> was overthrown in 1958 after six years in power. <ORGANIZATION> Accion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratica </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- AD -RRB-, the social democratic party now in power, is fielding <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a 69-year-old charismatic leader with considerable political experience. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s government in 1973-77 is popularly associated with the oil-prices boom in 1974. He is considered to have a slight edge now for the Dec. 4 election, although the 47-year-old <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the Copei or <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> candidate, has made inroads by raising the issue of electoral reform. After a shaky start, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> took the initiative with calls for direct elections of state governors, rather than by presidential appointment, and voting for individual congressional candidates, rather than by party lists. `` I do n't think there is an electoral system in the entire world as primitive as ours,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> told reporters recently. According to a recent <PERSON> Gaither </PERSON> poll done for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s AD, the promise of reform enabled <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> to narrow the distance between him and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to 11 percent by late January, from around 30 percent in November. Following <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s electoral-reforms proposal, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> came up with one of his own. `` I propose to the nation a Pact for Reform, to deepen and open our democratic system,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> announced at a public celebration Jan. 23 marking the 30th anniversary of the <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>'s overthrow The 10-point Pact for Reform contains proposals almost identical to the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s. `` The only thing -LRB- Perez -RRB- has to do now is support my candidacy,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> complained at a recent rally. The two major parties have staked out electoral bases so broad that voters are sometimes hard pressed to see a difference. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> preach political reforms of the democratic system, but they agree it should stay democratic. They argue about the degree of state intervention in the economy, but they agree the state should intervene. Copei, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, is considered somewhat more conservative, while AD, which belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, is more labor-oriented. But they are both centrist. Their members run from conservative to liberal, but most are somewhere in between. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s presidency has flipped back and forth between the AD and Copei five times in the six elections from 1958 to 1983. An AD candidate succeeded an AD president only once. Their success in dominating Venezuelan politics has relegated all the other parties to marginal political roles. The ex-guerrilla <PERSON> Petkoff </PERSON> is carrying the banner of the <LOCATION> Movimiento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Socialismo </LOCATION>. In the 1960s, when an indigenous guerrilla movement was active, <PERSON> Petkoff </PERSON> preached a socialism bordering on communism. But he gave up his fight, accepting amnesty offered by the government. He moderated his views and is now a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. His party dropped its affiliation with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> following the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslavakia </LOCATION> in 1968. But even though <PERSON> Petkoff </PERSON> started his campaign by trimming his bushy moustache and longish hair in an effort to dispel any conceptions of radicalism, he is n't expected to win much more than 5 percent of the vote. That was as much as his party got into 1978, its best year. The remaining candidates are even worse off. They are formally in the race but are not making much of a difference. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s first woman presidential candidate, <PERSON> Ismenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalba </PERSON>, is running on the slogan, `` <LOCATION> Ismenia </LOCATION>, take her into your heart.''

At least 500 researchers in about a dozen government-aided institutes are at work modernizing the ancient, creaking, plodding carts, and even the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has donated funds. Carts of various shapes and designs, made of plastic and aluminum, are being tested or have been developed. `` There is nothing funny about our project,'' said <PERSON> Mittar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhir </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` For us, animal-drawn carts are of great importance.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has an estimated 13 million bullock carts drawn by about 26 million of the neutered bulls, along with 2 million carts pulled by water buffaloes, camels, horses, mules and donkeys. The carts are seen most often in villages, where about 640 million of the <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people live. But they also are seen on major highways and an estimated 3 million plod along city streets, often slowing engine-powered traffic and infuriating motorists. <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> carts have even been used to pull MiG fighter jets to parades and earth satellites to launching pads. <PERSON> Dhir </PERSON> said it would be 50 years before <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> could eliminate animal-drawn carts, given their crucial role in Indian life. Capital investment in animal-drawn carts is put at $ 7.6 billion. More than 20 million Indians earn their living by driving, renting, and repairing the carts. `` The figure is striking given the fact that Indian railways, the fourth largest in the world, employ only 16.3 million people,'' said <PERSON> Rupinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> has designed six types of bullock cart for field trials. Each year, animal-drawn carts move 14.4 million ton-miles of freight. Dhir estimates that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s animal-drawn carts provide about 40 million horse-power, equal to about 320,000 medium-duty trucks used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as city delivery vehicles. Without bullock carts, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also would have had to import an additional 6 million tons of fuel each year. It now imports 17 million tons of crude oil annually. One of the innovations is the replacement of the carts' wooden-spoke wheels with pneumatic tires Engineer <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said carts with pneumatic tires can pull 2.5 tons of weight against the maximum capacity of 1.5 tons for conventional carts. Researchers in the southern state of <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> also have come up with plastic bullock carts, and in neighboring <LOCATION> Andhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state a tire company has produced carts of lightweight aluminum. Another idea behind non-wooden carts is to reduce demand for lumber. An estimated 165,000 medium-sized trees are felled each year to make conventional carts. `` So you see, there is a solid logic behind metal carts,'' said <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>. He listed other reasons for updating the carts. `` We want to increase tillage and output, reduce damage to roads and injury to animals so that the poor animals can have a longer lifespan,'' he said. To protect the animals, curved and padded yokes are being introduced. Studies have shown that some draft animals' lives are cut short by cancerous infections on the neck from unpadded and uncurved yokes. Reflectors are being added as another safety feature. Other new fittings are <PERSON> bush </PERSON> bearings, cast-iron springs, shock absorbers, draw bars that adjust for animals of different height, and mud scrappers. A fodder box can be put on carts that go long distances. As for road damage, director <PERSON> Dhir </PERSON> said the biggest culprit is wooden wheels. `` In monetary terms the annual damage is to the tune of 7,000 million rupees -LRB- $ 538 million -RRB- to the roads,'' he said. Farmers seem to like the idea of improving bullock carts. `` It is an excellent idea,'' said <PERSON> Jhandu </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Jharsa </LOCATION>, a village 30 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` But this should have had been done 25 years ago. We have suffered for long, and so did the animals.'' Officials, too, say the new carts are catching on, but this itself is creating problems. `` We do not have enough new types of carts for all,'' said <PERSON> Kalle </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, project economist of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jharsa </LOCATION>, whose office received only 16 new carts. `` There are more than 200 claimants. Even some gypsies saw the carts and were attracted. They wanted at least one. I told them no. These are for farmers.'' Another reason for high demand is that the government is subsidizing the price by about 35 percent. It is estimated that the largest of the old wooden carts costs the equivalent of about $ 300. Newer wooden carts, without the government subsidy, cost $ 270 to $ 460. The plastic and aluminum carts are 25 percent more expensive.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The former mayor of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, will be sentenced this week on charges that he extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from people wanting to do business with the city. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a Democrat, pleaded guilty to the charges, saying he accepted sole responsibility for what happened.

 In his day, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was one of the most visible mayors in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a politician who seemed destined for bigger things. Now he appears destined for prison. As mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s fifth-largest city, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> had a penchant for beautiful women, chauffeur-driven limos and bodyguards. He was a snappy dresser with a deep tan, his hair always in place. During his 16 years as mayor, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a Democrat, was often the spokesman for the nation's mayors. He served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> and six times was elected president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>. There was talk of a big job in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speculation that he might some day run for governor. Party leaders made him their candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, but he lost the primary to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Now it turns out the man who looked so urbane and polished was actually an extortionist, using his power to coerce money from people wanting to do business with the city of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s scheme preyed on architects, lawyers, engineers, and insurance agents. They paid him up to 25 percent of the cost of the project and payments were made in bonds, gold coins and cash. For example, an architect paid <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> $ 125,000 for the opportunity to work on a project at the city's <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> and another paid $ 25,500 for a hospital parking garage expansion. An insurance agent paid an Alexander bagman $ 26,200 for a fire policy and a lawyer paid a bagman $ 2,878 to handle the legal work on a downtown building project. `` A lot of people turned down the deals and nothing happened,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was astute enough to know where he could put the pressure. If someone caved in, well, he kept the pressure on. If someone rebuffed him right away, he'd back right up.'' By the time <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> left city hall in 1986, he was a millionaire. Now he has to pay it all back. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges that he violated federal racketeering laws by using his power as mayor to extort money, that he conspired to obstruct the investigation and that he evaded income taxes on his illegal profits. Sentencing is scheduled for March 10. The federal prosecutor is recommending that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $ 100,000. <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> said he believes that a 10-year sentence would be longer than any handed to a public corruption figure in the nation. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> could have faced 690 years in prison if convicted on all 40 counts of the original indictment. The former mayor has also agreed to return $ 1.2 million of his illegal profits. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> has said the settlement will leave him in worse financial shape than he was in 1970 when he began his mayoral career. Some of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s bounty was turned over to prosecutors by attorneys delivering shopping bags filled with valuable bonds and coupons. Some of the money was banked overseas in such places as the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>. Nine other people who have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the investigation will be sentenced along with <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s undoing started with <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>'s appointment as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and earned his law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he had heard talk that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was crooked. `` This thing really began when I first became <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney,'' <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> says. `` There were rumors on the street then about <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> being a wheeler and a dealer. If not kickbacks, then there was talk about a lot of conflicts. The rumors were pretty rampant. I decided we should look into it and put them to rest one way or another.'' At first, it was slow going. But the investigation persisted. `` You keep working and working, nibbling away at it, developing whatever information you can,'' <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> says. `` There was a pattern of no-bid contracts and professional fees. `` We got a couple of breaks. We got lucky.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> joined <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>'s attorneys in the investigation A witness came forward offering information in exchange for immunity. `` That was the crack in the dam,'' <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> says. At its peak, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was the focus of attention of a team of prosecutors, 20 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and another 20 <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents. What they came up with was enough evidence to persuade a grand jury to indict the mayor. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> always seemed on the verge of becoming a political heavyweight.

<HEAD>SYRACUSE, N.Y.: political heavyweight.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In 1976, he passed up an opportunity to be an early supporter of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s presidential campaign to serve as upstate campaign coordinator for the ill-fated campaign of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. His extortion scheme was designed to increase his influence with national politicians, according to <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>. `` He wanted to be considered a viable influence on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and make things happen,'' <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> said. `` He could get the money where other people could not.'' Many of the kickbacks <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> arranged were made in the form of political contributions to big-time Democrats, <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were among the recipients. `` Toward the end he sort of lost track of the political contributions,'' <PERSON> Scullins </PERSON> said. `` As he could see his star dwindling the last three or four years, I think he was more concerned about lining his own pockets. He got greedier and greedier as time went on.'' Opponents were critical of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s frequent trips away from <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, saying he was more interested in traveling than tending to local problems. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> defended his travels, saying he came back with federal money for his city. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> found an opportunity to get some publicity one day when a gunman killed a man, then took a pregnant woman and her baby hostage in a predominantly black neighborhood, holding police off for most of the day. After being held back by police for many hours, news photographers were suddenly allowed to approach the house. The door opened and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> ran out of the house clutching the baby to his chest. Photographs of the mayor carrying the baby to safety were displayed by newspapers across the country the next day. Black leaders complained that it was the only time <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> had ever visited the neighborhood. On the local level, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was a skillful and effective politician. Until <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> came along, the Republicans dominated <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Onondaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> politics. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s campaign not only ended a 16-year Republican rule of the mayor's office, but led the Democrats to control of the common council. Not everyone liked <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. When shots were fired at his house, police were prompted to build a guardhouse outside the home. City Auditor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> was probably <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s most vocal critic. <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>'s complaints were aimed mainly at the way the mayor did business. The auditor said he knew then that the city was paying too much money for projects and was always doing business with the same people. `` I noticed a pattern that if not illegal, and I had no proof of that, it was not in the best interest of the city,'' said <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>, who is still the city auditor. Ironically, while <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was in power, his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents who controlled surrounding <LOCATION> Onondaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were the target of a special prosecutor investigating political corruption. Despite the talk on the street, the special prosecutor did n't pay much attention to the Democrats. The special prosecutor was appointed by then-Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, a Democrat, to investigate allegations that Republicans illegally coerced political contributions from public workers. The investigation netted convictions against several key Republicans who claimed they were unfairly singled out for activities common in politics and also practiced by City Hall Democrats. But the crimes of the Republicans pale when compared with what was going on in <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s city hall office. The Republicans were convicted of violations of a state law prohibiting political fund-raising in public buildings and misdemeanors. Juries returned acquittals on the more serious charges. No Republicans went to prison and no Democrats were ever indicted in that special investigation. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> is not talking publicly about his troubles, his lawyer said. After making his guilty plea, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> issued a statement saying the city never paid for any services it did not receive. `` I accept sole responsibility for what happened,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said in his statement. `` While pursuing the highest standards of integrity with respect to the conduct of members of my administration, I did not apply those same standards to myself.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a Democrat, is the mayor now, and he runs things differently. Instead of personally selecting who does business with the city, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has contractors submit competitive bids. Young has a panel study the proposals before a contract is awarded. There are many who still believe <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was good for <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. `` I never saw any sign of any wrongdoing,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Visser </PERSON>, the city clerk who has worked in city hall since 1974. `` He did an awful lot of good for the city and eventually the good will outweigh the bad. If it had not been for the former mayor, the city of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> would not be in the great shape it is in today.''

 Her family jewels are gone and her castle is property of the communist state, but <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> has found peace at a monastery in rural western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The 79-year-old princess is now known as the Rev. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, one of 12 nuns who share food, work and prayer at the Romanian Orthodox monastery. The nun of 27 years was the founder of the Orthodox Monastery of the Transfiguration, the first English-speaking Orthodox monastery in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But vestiges of her royal past remain, even at the monastery. Portraits of her parents, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, hang in the living room of the A-frame house she shares with another nun. Gold and silver icons dating as far back as the 15th century fill a corner of her bedroom, including one handed down in the family from Czar Nicholas I of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and said to contain a splinter of Christ's cross. Antique icons also decorate the monastery's small, candle-lit chapel, as do crosses and triptychs, some of which she brought from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A small, gold container on a bed stand holds her most precious possession, a handful of Romanian soil snatched during her escape from Soviet communism in the wake of World War II. She wants it buried with her. `` There's a big gap between then and now,'' she says. `` So much has happened in between.'' Uncomfortable sitting with idle hands, the tall, stately nun worked on a knotted prayer rope as she reflected on her multifaceted life. `` It's been different so many times over,'' she says. `` But, you see, one lives day by day, does n't one?'' She refuses to compare her royal and religious ways of life. `` There is no point,'' she said. `` I did my duty as a princess. And now I'm doing my duty as a nun.'' Her superiors, nonetheless, are impressed by her example. `` As a person, as an individual, I have admiration because even not having a position, she could have had a social life, which would be much more in keeping with other people of her background,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Popp </PERSON>, 47, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` Instead of saying she was a princess who became a nun, I think it was more she was a nun coming through the life of a princess.'' Although just a child during the German invasion of World War I, Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> accompanied her mother, the queen, from hospital to hospital, administering to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s wounded and hungry. By the time World War II erupted, both her parents were dead, her older brother, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, had ascended the throne, one sister had become queen of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and another queen of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> was living in a castle outside <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, wife of an archduke of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the mother of six. Afraid of the Nazi regime, Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> and her family moved in 1944 to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. There she set up hospitals and did what she could for her suffering compatriots. In December 1947, the king of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was forced by the communists to abdicate and the following week, Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> and the rest of the royal family were exiled. Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> immigrated with her family to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> before settling in 1950 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a move that ultimately led to divorce. To support her children, she sold her cherished diamond and sapphire tiara, lectured about life behind the Iron Curtain, and wrote an autobiography titled, `` I Live Again.'' It was n't until 1961, after her children were grown, that the 52-year-old princess became a postulant. She ended a second marriage to do so. `` In my heart,'' she says, `` I always wanted to become a nun. But there was so much to be done in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> when I was young.'' Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> took the monastic vows of stability, obedience, poverty and chastity in 1967 and, with that profession, became <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>. Later that year, she put up a trailer on 100 acres of farmland outside <LOCATION> Ellwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and began building an English-speaking monastery for Orthodox women of all ethnic backgrounds.

 An organization of engineers, best known by its initials on motor oil cans, hopes to do for spaceships what it did for automobiles and airplanes. The Society of Automotive Engineers -LRB- SAE -RRB-, founded in 1905, is a global engineering network for the exchange of ideas. Members have included <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>. SAE writes standards on such things as what grade of motor oil works best in cold temperatures, how much reflection comes from a taillight lens, the process that makes a brake stop a car. More than 900 standards cover every passenger car. These standards make sure a product performs in a generally expected way. They are guideposts by which government and industry have measured performance for 83 years in self-propelled vehicles. `` We serve the public by getting the technology out so that others can build upon it and use it as a steppingstone without having to reinvent the wheel,'' says <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumbaugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive vice president of SAE. SAE now has its eyes on the stars. It created a space standardization advisory committee, which met for the first time in December, for possible standards on spaceships. SAE hopes to work with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on guidelines that would reduce confusion, eliminate duplication and cut costs. `` The space program has been so unique, we've been experimenting with technology that is one of a kind,'' says <PERSON> Arshad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafeez </PERSON>, SAE's aerospace engineer Six of the 25 members on SAE's exploratory committee are from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to have a space station in orbit in the next decade so it can assemble ships in space, among other things. `` It's getting to the point where some standardization will help everybody,'' says <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, manager of engineering standards and practices for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's enough on the horizon that if we do n't do something soon, we could be in big trouble. Everybody will be going in a different direction.'' <PERSON> Rumbaugh </PERSON> adds: `` As they start putting things up there like a space station, you've got to have interchangeability of parts for repair and maintenance. `` You ca n't be coming back down here when a light bulb goes out and build a new one to take back up. Standards allow you to reduce the cost of manufacturing. Making one of a kind costs you a fortune.'' SAE has its world headquarters in a three-story, red brick building about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Turnpike and Interstate 79. With 52,000 members in 82 countries, it has 25,000 technical papers on file, holds 20 meetings a year, publishes two magazines and has an engineering library. None of the volumes will make a best-seller list, but they titillate engineers. Esoteric titles include: The Internal Combustion Engine In Theory And Practice, volumes one and two; Fuel Alternatives For Spark Ignition And Diesel Engines; Reinforced Thermosetting Plastics For Ground Vehicle Applications; The Toyota Production Method; and Human Tolerance To Impact Conditions As Related To Motor Vehicle Design. Some car manuals are available in Spanish, French and German. Anyone who pours a can of motor oil can notice the letters SAE along with numbers corresponding to the viscosity of the oil. SAE standards cover 11 grades of oil, with lower numbers performing better in lower temperatures. Oil companies voluntarily produce and label their products by SAE standards. Other SAE deeds are less visible. `` A lot of the work is sort of boring,'' <PERSON> Rumbaugh </PERSON> says. `` We do n't have a lot of hoopla. SAE just attempts to get the job done. Oftentimes, a job can get done a heck of a lot better before it gets a lot of media exposure. We prefer to do things before getting the hype.'' SAE was fringhouse for a free exchange of ideas at a time when inventors were making contraptions that suited their own tastes. Each car still has unique style features. But SAE standards cover such things as ounded as a cleahow much light is emitted by headlamps, the shade of red in a taillight, the area of the windshield that should be cleared by a wiper and the size of the lug nuts that hold a rim onto a wheel. SAE also helped develop the closed-in auto body, the self-starter that replaced the hand crank, the hydraulic brake, the synchronized transmissions that eliminated gear noises and led to the automatic transmission, shatterproof glass, power steering and power brakes. `` The American automobile industry has thrived on the principle that the exchange of technical information improves society,'' <PERSON> Rumbaugh </PERSON> says. `` They are less secretive than almost any other industry in the world.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, writing in 1980 on The journalists also met with a member of what <PERSON> Bleibtreu </PERSON> said was the Contra human rights commission.

In his letter Feb. 17, <PERSON> DePaulis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>'s story overlooked the city's rich cultural climate and ethnic diversity, as well as its beautiful mountain scenery. `` I wish he could see the 10th St. Patrick's Day Parade, whose grand marshal this year is consul general of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, or the Italian-American Columbus Day celebration, ongoing since 1934, or our annual Greek Festival and Hispanic Fiesta,'' <PERSON> DePaulis </PERSON> wrote. The mayor said he might try to find a sponsor for Lamb if the invitation is accepted.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ A <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> television reporter took to the streets a few years ago and asked dozens of passersby to describe the current sky without looking up. Only one in 10 could do so. That inspired him to design a sky-watching program for schoolchildren called `` For Spacious Skies'' that is getting rave reviews from many educators.

 It was a blustery <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> morning, with a cutting wind blowing off <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. People were staying inside if they could, but <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Keohane </PERSON> and her first-graders were up on the school roof again, looking at the pale winter sky. `` What's moving the clouds?'' she asks, pointing at a bank of cumuli. `` The wind,'' reply the kids in an enthusiastic chorus. `` There's light blue, and dark blue and baby blue over there,'' says a little girl, her scarf flapping as she stared intently at the heavens. The boy next to her interrupted: `` There's a swordfish with a long nose.'' His comments were suddenly lost in a babble of other kids' voices. `` Look, those clouds look like a sweat suit,'' said one. `` I see an upside-down dragon,'' another giggled. Back at their desks later, the children took turns spelling sky-related words in a variation of the classic hangman game, doing well on big ones like `` lightning,'' and `` showers.'' A diminutive boy spelled `` rain,'' and Ms. <PERSON> Keohane </PERSON> asked: `` What would happen if we did n't have rain for 100 days?'' `` There would be no flowers and no wildlife,'' one of the pupils piped up. `` That would n't matter,'' said another. `` We'd still have water in the sinks.'' In Ms. <PERSON> Keohane </PERSON>'s inner-city classroom at the <ORGANIZATION> Josiah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quincy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and at about 1,400 others across the country, teachers say that a program called `` For Spacious Skies'' is helping pupils academically and emotionally. Some of those involved with the program go even further, suggesting that sky watching can turn tough inner-city kids away from drugs and desperation and on to aesthetic beauty instead. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>, originator of the program, says, `` Wherever you are you have the sky, whether you are living in the high mountains or the worst of slums. As a matter of fact, the person living in the worst slums often has access to the most sky.'' A study conducted by researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> appears to support some of the positive claims made by teachers enthused about sky watching Using two classrooms at an elementary school in <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION>, a community about 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the study compared pupils who participated in `` For Spacious Skies'' in the fall of 1985 and again at the end of the school year, with those who were not encouraged to look at the sky. The researchers found that the emphasis on looking up, followed by drawing pictures and writing about the sky, `` significantly increased the level of aesthetic sensitivity in visual art and literature.'' `` The benefits gained from a program such as this would have a great value in any school curriculum,'' the study said. The program encourages children to keep journals on their observations and some of them write poetry and draw pictures, said researcher <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>. `` The fact that kids are exposed to the arts in this way helps create an awareness that probably helps the increase in their skills.'' `` For Spacious Skies'' is named after the familiar first line of the <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> poem, set to music by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> as `` America the Beautiful.'' <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>, a quixotic former television reporter, believes that we can not spend life looking at our feet. His vision came to him about 10 years ago, while working at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION>. Taking to the street, he asked dozens of passersby to describe the current sky without looking up. Only one in 10 could do so.

 `` I myself was a non-aware person,'' <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> says. `` Then I began to see that it's a good thing to turn people on to the sky.'' Since that summer day in 1977, <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>, 59, has formed a non-profit company to distribute `` For Spacious Skies'' teaching kits, which offer suggestions on how to use the heavens to teach just about anything. `` ` For Spacious Skies' is designed to help teach mathematics, English, creative writing, music, art and science,'' according to the preface of a booklet meant for schools in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> area. `` This program, just like the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> sky, is limitless. With the sky as a catalyst, your student's imagination can be challenged to its limits.'' The kits, which are mailed to schools for about $ 7.50, include guides for teachers on presenting the material. They contain tables of wind-chill factors, relative humidity and barometric pressure, songs about the sky, and sample observation sheets for students to note weather conditions. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cataldo </PERSON>, a support specialist at <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>, outlined the different uses of the program at her 830-pupil school: `` Some of the upper classes are keeping charts about the length of the day and how that relates to the harvest and growing cycles, and that brings out social studies ... what are some of the origins of feast days and festivals that are based on the length of the days and the growing season. `` At lower grades, kids can do bar graphs of how many sunny days there were in January and how many snowy days there were ... measuring and counting and a number of interdisciplinary skills. It allows children to write. They might also do a science project around wind speed.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proclaimed last March 18 `` For Spacious Skies Day'' in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> honored the program for its work in public education a year ago and scheduled presentations on `` For Spacious Skies'' at its annual meeting this year at <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Weather forecasters are <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>'s key allies in getting the word to teachers about sky watching. Many have mentioned the program during their broadcasts, and some have gone even further, incorporating aspects of `` For Spacious Skies'' in weather lectures and seminars for children and teachers. Meteorologist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwoegler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> said he was amazed at the interest in `` For Spacious Skies'' booklets offered on the air to teachers. `` I ran a three-part series in our news last March in which we offered 3,500 teachers' guides ... and we had a very enthusiastic response,'' he said. `` They were all gone within a month.'' In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, weatherman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> of <PERSON> KDKA-TV </PERSON> said his station's booklet giveaway had similar success. Discussing the program's value in tougher inner-city schools, <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> drew parallels between sports and sky watching. `` Just like athletics has been a vehicle to get kids out of the ghetto, I'm looking at ` For Spacious Skies' as a vehicle for sparking interest in a particular field like geography,'' he said. `` What I'm seeing is kids who are interested in something else than <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. They, for the first time, are observing the beauty of nature.'' <PERSON> Violet </PERSON> <PERSON> Witherspoon </PERSON>, a disciple of sky watching who teaches the third-grade at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section, expressed similar sentiments `` I told the children, ` You do n't need drugs, let the sky be your drug,''' she said. `` They can look at the sky and daydream. They do n't have to have fine clothes, they do n't have to have fine cars, beauty is all around them, and it's free.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Born in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> hill town, Seka got interested in the porn business through her boyfriend who owned adult bookstores. Today she's a legend in the adult-film industry, as a performer and as an astute businesswoman.

 A porn queen who found her way to the other side of the camera is ascending toward the top in a $ 1 billion-a-year business where many women work but precious few call the shots. She's a platinum blonde whose stage name is Seka. At 33, she has appeared in more than three dozen hard-core adult films over the past decade. `` She is still legendary,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishbein </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` When today's generation delves into the adult-film market for the first time, she is still the one they want to see.'' But the big reason for <ORGANIZATION> Seka </ORGANIZATION>'s financial success is that she sued her manager under federal corruption laws and gained control of her name, her films and a business that turns annual profits in six figures. Dressed demurely in a sweater and slacks and tucked into the corner of a dark restaurant, Seka looks every bit the businesswoman she is as chief executive officer of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Pearl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which sells everything from lighters with her logo to panties. `` Nobody has ever taken care of me,'' <PERSON> Seka </PERSON> says matter-of-factly, running a bright pink fingernail through her close-cropped, platinum hair. `` And as long as I look after business, nobody ever will.'' Seka -LRB- she will not disclose her given name -RRB- was born in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> hill town of <LOCATION> Radford </LOCATION>, where the main industry was an arsenal that manufactures dynamite. She married a factory worker before she finished high school, but the marriage did n't last long. `` All I knew was I wanted to be on my own. I wanted to be independent,'' she recalled. `` I did n't want to wake up and have someone next to me saying, ` Fix me coffee and breakfast.''' Her introduction to the porn industry came during the mid-1970s through a boyfriend who owned adult bookstores. The more she became involved in the trade, the more she became convinced, `` I could do it better.'' She worked her way back from the distributors she knew through the bookstore business to the moviemakers themselves, went to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> one bright day in 1977, answered an ad for a nude model, and started working that afternoon. Seka was paid $ 200 for her first movie, a 15-minute, 8mm film. Many of her early films _ she made more than two dozen between 1977 and 1979 _ were only slightly more memorable, although the pay scale improved considerably. She was, however, just another 23-year-old ingenue making adult films, indistinguishable from dozens of other young women in the de rigeur black nylons and garter belts of the times. Then she met a makeup man with big plans. It was 1980 and the home-video market was just beginning to heat up. He made her over, bulked her up with weights and vitamins, changed the way she dressed, and managed her business in the bargain. Her new look debuted in 1981 in Club magazine and the result was booming sales. Yet, after what should have been a very profitable rise to the top of her profession, <PERSON> Seka </PERSON> had to hire an attorney simply to look at her own books. One glimpse and she sued her manager for diverting income. She worked sparingly over the next two years, ultimately finding herself in 1984 with a handsome settlement and control of a potentially lucrative business now that the home-video market was changing the rules of the adult-film game. No longer dependent on recovering most of the costs from theaters, adult film-making became an almost risk-free venture. A handful of pornographers had recognized the home-video market's untapped potential ahead of the major movie studios and already were doing land-office business. A movie that could be made for as little as $ 150,000 if shot on film _ or $ 20,000 if shot directly onto videotape _ becomes a profit-maker after only moderate sales and rentals. That meant an adult film had only to sell about 20,000 videocassettes _ an average wholesale cost of $ 25 per cassette _ to qualify as a megahit. By comparison, a major movie studio needs to sell 50,000 units to approach the same status. And Seka needed only one look to realize that under the new economic reality, age and overexposure were threatening her main asset _ her body. So in 1984 she added a copyright attorney to gain control of her old material, then a contract attorney to make certain she got top dollar for whatever new material she released. She has made just two feature films since then _ only one has been released _ studied diction and elocution and devoted most of her time to mastering business skills: computers, flow charts, marketing and the like. Her return to the adult-film industry as an actress came in a big way with the 1986 film, `` Careful, He May Be Watching.'' The movie, which cost about $ 230,000 to make, stars Seka in a dual role as twins, one evil, one not. She also conceived the story line, developed the script and served as producer. Former porn star actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> directed, making the film something of a trailblazing effort from start to finish. `` Careful'' won the Adult Video News awards for best picture and best director, capped off by <PERSON> Seka </PERSON>'s induction into the Hall of Fame. But she says `` Careful'' wo n't begin making money until it's been on the market for about 2 -LCB- years `` I can wait,'' she said. `` I've got some projects, an exclusive magazine deal, things I ca n't talk about in the wings. I've even been offered the opportunity to be in a major motion picture, but there were casting couches behind the screen. `` At least what I do,'' Seka concluded, `` is on the screen.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> Janwillem </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON> wrote his first book at age 40 after years of hopping around the globe and pursuing an interest in Zen Buddhism.

 Fans of offbeat mysteries set in exotic locales dote on Dutch author <PERSON> Janwillem </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> cop who spent two years in a Zen Buddhist monastery in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But even though his novels often have a Zen flavor, van de Wetering says the three heroes of what his publisher calls `` the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> cop series'' are not followers of the Oriental philosophy. `` They've never heard of Buddhism or Zen,'' says <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON>, who now makes his home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, drawn there first by a Zen teacher. `` I mention it sometimes, in a joking manner, because it's popular with the Dutch intelligentsia. The police could n't care less They think it's all long-haired nonsense.'' Yet, their supercool investigations read like they're following the Zen practice of attaining enlightenment by intuitive insight, beyond intellectual reasoning. `` A lot of people do that,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON> says. `` If you ca n't figure it out, then do n't try to figure it out but stay with it.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON>, now 56, wrote his first book when he was 40. It was `` The Empty Mirror,'' about his experiences in the Zen monastery. He has written three childrens books, two novels, two books about Zen, a biography of Dutch diplomat-author <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulik </PERSON> and is best known for 12 mysteries, most set in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. The first mystery van de Wetering wrote, `` Outsider in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>,'' introduced the wonderfully detached Commissaris, a Dutch municipal police officer, and his underlings in the murder brigade, Adjutant <PERSON> Grijpstra </PERSON> and Sgt. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gier </PERSON>. `` Originally I wanted to write a realistic book about the police,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON> said during a visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to visit his publisher. `` I had been a policeman myself and thought I could do it. It never came off, even at first. None of the characters wanted to do that. `` Grijpstra was going to be the nasty guy. He immediately became sympathetic. He is my Dutchman, my everyman, my superego. He is not into fantasy. I intended him to be pretty dumb but he is n't. `` <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gier </PERSON> turned out to have tremendous energy that everybody has as a child and then it gets repressed and organized by society. With <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gier </PERSON> it never got organized. He is not in the police for any good purpose; he's an adventurer. He's tremendously curious; he wants to see what goes on. He does n't necessarily sympathize with goodness and frown on evilness. `` The only one who's got it all together is the Commissaris. He looks like a gray mouse, with his limp, but he really is a combination of them and goes beyond both of them. He is what I think a Zen master ought to be like. The Commissaris is convinced it does n't matter what you do but he will always do the nice thing.'' Two of van de Wetering's mysteries have been made into movies in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. Contracts for an American movie have been signed for `` Hard Rain,'' published in 1986 by Pantheon. <PERSON> Ballantine </PERSON> has published all the mysteries and the two books about Zen in paperback. The author, whose name is pronounced yan-villum van de vet-tevin, started visiting a Zen teacher on the coast of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> in the 1960s. In 1975, he and his Colombian wife, <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON>, settled nearby. He became disillusioned with the Zen teacher but stayed in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> because he likes the country. His wife took up gardening. Their daughter is married. `` We live on 60 acres, which is quite normal there,'' he says. `` I see my neighbors when I go look for them. But too many artists hang out in that part of the world. We meet each other in endless encounters that consume too much time. I really have to discipline myself when I go to the post office not to lose all day. `` The weather is so interesting. We all have boats. There's a big colony of seals and we talk about what they do and what bird is coming for the summer or leaving for the winter. `` I have very little discipline. If I do n't want to work, I peer at the window and hope the dog will come in. When I want to work, I'll work through the night and the next day wo n't go to the post office.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON>'s hobby is making junk sculpture, which he displays around his property. `` I was always frantic about finding certain parts. An old man said, ` Just let it come to you.' I do that all the time now. When I turned 50, I was worried about dying. I wanted a vehicle to guide me across _ a horse. The afternoon I thought of it, I went to the beach and found legs and ribs, a sheet of plywood that was a wonderful fit and rope for the tail.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetering </PERSON> learned about the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> police work during seven years in the reserve police, working mostly nights and weekends. `` I had to do it because I got accused of dodging the draft. I left <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> when I was 19 and never remembered to come back. It was kind of a punishment. I liked it. After four years I could have quit.'' At 19, van de Wetering went to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to work, then to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to study philosophy for a year. Dissatisfied with Western philosophy, he spent two years in a Zen monastery in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. After that he worked for a chemical company in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, in real estate in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, returned to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> to take over his uncle's wholesale textile business. He got bored with that, sold it after seven years and moved to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He started to write during the seven years in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. `` I always wanted to write,'' he says. `` I could n't. I did bits and pieces and articles. I read that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> started when he was 40. I kept the desire alive. I started writing when I was 40.''

 <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON>, making his first real venture into television, is amazed that producers and network executives are listening to his suggestions and putting them on the screen. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> stars in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy-adventure series `` Sonny Spoon'' as an unorthodox detective who is part con man, part actor, and regularly slips into other characterizations to get the job done. Last year, he appeared in about six episodes of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` L.A. Law'' and won the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> Image Award as best supporting actor for his role in `` Heartbreak Ridge.'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, called him in for a meeting and asked him to do a series. Producer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> saw a short film he did and wanted to work with him. So <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> went to work on the idea of `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> suggested some scenes for the show. `` One is that I hide out in a Baptist church dressed up as a big lady in the choir,'' he says. `` Then the choral director points to me and I have to sing a solo. They used my suggestion. `` In another show, a friend of mine steals some jewels from a mobster, not knowing he's a mobster. When he finds out, I dress up like a priest and return the jewels. `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON>'s like a chameleon. He can plug into any character. In the episode we're doing now I go undercover as a white yuppie. I have blue eyes and blond hair. `` It's exciting for me as an actor. You get to play so many different roles. I can cross age lines, sex lines, race lines.'' During his lunch break in his trailer, which is parked in the Veterans Cemetery in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> near the campus of <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, he eats a quick lunch brought to him by his mother. Later, the company moves to <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. On arrival at the new location, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> points to a banged-up yellow Porche Carbriolet. `` They wanted to give me a new Porche,'' he says. `` I said no, <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> would drive a car with dents in it.'' Until about two years ago, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> was working mostly in the theater as an actor, writer and director. He grew up in show business as the son of director-actor <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON>. A short film he wrote, directed and played in, `` Juliet,'' attracted some attention. `` It's about a girl who goes through a bunch of guys,'' he says. `` I played all the guys. <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> saw that and wrote some of those characterizations into ` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>.' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> says that both <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> encouraged his suggestions about the show. `` To tell the truth, I was n't sure anything would come out of it,'' he says. `` That's why I was so bold in speaking up. For instance, I said I did n't want my character to carry a gun. I called him a ` finagling humanitarian.' It's like when Bugs Bunny comes up against the Tasmanian Devil. He has to get out of that situation on his wits alone. `` That makes it a little tougher to write. It's easy to write that a character gets out of a car and pulls a gun. It's much harder to have him suddenly become a Hispanic taxi driver.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> got a degree in economics at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and went to work as a budget analyst for the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I figured if I could do Mayor -LRB- <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s budget I could do a movie budget,'' he says. `` I thought it was time to get back into acting and thought dad would help out. I took him to his favorite <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant. I said, ` I've got my degree, are you going to help me out?' `` He said, ` No.' He said the restaurant was full of people who were waiting for a break. It was up to me to go out and make my own breaks. But mom and dad were very supportive. They came to see me in every little play I did. Now I meet some kids of famous people who ca n't do anything on their own.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> likens his interest in acting, writing, directing and producing to working on a farm. `` On a farm you do n't just do one thing,'' he says. `` You plow a field, fix the tractor, feed the chickens, patch up the barn roof. In other words, you do everything. That's the way I grew up in the business.''

 <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> may be known as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most prolific comic playwright, but the man often billed as an English <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says his plays are getting darker. In his 32nd play, `` Woman in Mind,'' now at off-Broadway's <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the author presents a heroine on the brink of madness Audiences may laugh at first, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> says, but he hopes the chuckles ultimately catch in the throat. `` It's an attempt to be a popular play saying something serious,'' the 48-year-old <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> said the other day in an office at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s National Theater where he has been in residence as a director and a playwright since the fall of 1986. `` I stopped calling my plays comedies years and years ago,'' says the London-born writer who began his career as an actor and stage manager. `` People write and say, ` Woman in Mind' is rather sad at the end, is n't it?' and I say, ` Well, yeah. I only said it was a play, not a comedy.''' A rotund, engaging man with a low laugh that sometimes swallows up his words, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> has made his reputation over two decades by chronicling the humors and the horrors of the British lower middle class. While such colleagues as <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON> spin elegantly phrased dramas out of the mores of the well-heeled, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s terrain is the same middle class that makes up his audience. They are the people he courts and, sometimes, critiques. `` I take the audience by the hand and take them down a path they would not normally have gone,'' <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> says. That audience has remained loyal over two decades, since his 1963 play `` Mr. Whatnot,'' about a mute piano tuner, brought him acclaim and an agent, the influential <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>. According to a 1985-86 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s plays were second that year only to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s in numbers of performances given throughout <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s regional theaters His work is performed in more than 35 countries as far afield as <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Although several have been seen on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> _ most recently `` Bedroom Farce'' in 1978 _ he has not yet enjoyed a Broadway smash. `` Broadway is the toughest nut to crack, of course, in the whole world,'' <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> said, conceding he was preoccupied with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reception of `` Woman in Mind.'' `` I do n't know how they'll take it,'' he said of the play, which casts <ORGANIZATION> Stockard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channing </ORGANIZATION> _ 1985's Tony-winning star of `` Joe Egg'' _ as a middle-class Englishwoman named <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> who seeks refuge from her dreary domestic routine in a fantasy world rife with its own dangers. `` I wanted to get inside somebody else's head, really inside it, and see if I could bring the audience with me,'' <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> says. `` I also wanted to say, ` This is what it must be like to have your powers of mental perception slipping away from you.''' `` In <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s case,'' he continues, `` you suddenly realize she's unreliable _ not deliberately, but that her perceptions of what is real and what is not are completely She begins to get reality and dream muddled.'' `` Woman in Mind,'' which had a successful West End production starring <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, is just one recent <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> play that looks at the moral and psychological underside of people and their society. In `` A Small Family Business,'' currently at the National Theater, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> weaves a tale of ethical decay in which the upstanding hero, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, gets sucked into corruption both at home and at work. `` Henceforward,'' which played <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s Alley Theater last fall with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> and which opens on the West End with <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellen </PERSON> in November, dramatizes a futuristic British society dominated by thugs, hoodlums, and people who have become robots. It's a far cry from the <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> of `` Absurd Person Singular'' and `` The Norman Conquests,'' two hits from the mid-1970s which showed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and Broadway the playwright's clockwork precision with a laugh. Does the author sometimes feel that his earlier works were written by a different person? `` It's like looking at an old snapshot and saying, ` I do n't remember looking like that,''' he said `` I no longer really remember why I wrote them. I've just moved on.'' He said he's no longer as concerned with craft per se as he once was. `` When I started, it was like a kid discovering he's got 10 fingers. It's great to use them all, and I use them quite a lot,'' said <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>, whose works often feature multiple endings _ some decided by coin tosses _ and Chinese box-like plays-within-plays. `` Once you've done a few of those bravado tricks and shown yourself you can do it, the technique I hope sinks a little bit.'' More recently, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> has had great success as a director. His production of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` A View From the Bridge,'' starring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambon </PERSON> as <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, ended its acclaimed yearlong run on Feb. 20. He also directed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s 1630 verse drama, ``' T is Pity She's a Whore,'' at the National's Olivier <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, who appeared as the gamekeeper <ORGANIZATION> Scudder </ORGANIZATION> in the film `` <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>,'' stars as the incestuous <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>. Now it's back up north to the <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> city of <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>, a resort and conference town where <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> is the artistic director of the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Theater-in-the-Round </PERSON>. There, he will open his 35th play, `` Love of My Life.'' And what's that like? He chuckles: `` It's a bit lighter.''

<TEXT>
 Then came a series of jolts, starting with a summit meeting in October 1986 between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in which the leaders came close to agreeing on the elimination of all ballistic nuclear missiles. This stunned West Europeans, who felt the Americans had not adequately consulted them on such a proposal, which they strongly opposed. From that point, it was increasingly clear that major reductions in nuclear arms were likely. The first step was taken this past Dec. 8 when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty eliminating land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles, representing about 4 percent of their arsenals. With the INF treaty, as it is called, expected to win <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval within a few months, and the superpowers already agreed in principle to 50 percent cuts in their long-range, or strategic, nuclear arms, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> finds itself facing tough choices about adjusting its military posture. One of the most difficult and immediate choices is whether and how to modernize the U.S.-controlled nuclear weapons that will remain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the American cruise and <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 rockets are withdrawn. The gist of the debate is that most <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> governments, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, say this upgrading is vitally important, while most factions in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s coalition government strongly oppose it. Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary general, says the alliance must ignore Soviet warnings that an upgrading of the nuclear arms would inflame the arms race and violate the spirit of East-West disarmament efforts. `` If you do n't modernize, eventually you do n't have any nuclear weapons, which they -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- would like,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said in an interview. The West Germans have clear reasons for disliking the more than 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons that are candidates for modernization: most of them, including artillery, bombs and land-based missiles, are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; if fired the likelihood is that many would strike only in East or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. While their nation is divided, Germans still regard themselves historically as one people. The West German government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to open negotiations with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear arms _ those with ranges of less than 500 kilometers -LRB- 310 miles -RRB- and not covered by the U.S.-Soviet treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other alliance members fear this would play into the hands of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has said repeatedly that his aim is to rid <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of all nuclear weapons. Some European analysts worry that it eventually could be the undoing of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> itself. `` The reopening of the nuclear issue in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has the potential ultimately to break up the alliance,'' <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lellouche </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internationales </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in a recent newspaper column. From the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> viewpoint, improvement of nuclear weapons remaining in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is directly linked to the question of whether some of the American troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, mostly in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, may be pulled out. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said repeatedly that it opposes any troop withdrawals. Yet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said recently that if <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> lost its short-range nuclear arms _ either through negotiation or obsolesence _ a troop pullout might be considered. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies have gotten the message. `` Under whatever administration comes next in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there will be more pressure for reducing the American commitment in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoop </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheffer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Said another <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, speaking privately: `` There is a feeling here that despite the best intentions of the current administration, it's only a matter of time before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop levels are reduced.'' <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, the West German defense minister who is due to succeed <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s top political officer this summer, was quoted as saying in a recent newspaper interview that he saw `` a certain evolution'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> thinking that raises some questions about how long the West Europeans can count on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to keep its troops on the continent. `` That's why our <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> role -LRB- in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- must reflect our own interests,'' he said.

<HEAD>Family-Run Cafe Shows Limits and Prospects of Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A few months ago, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> had a good income from a prestigious job teaching Chinese. Now she and her family run a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant and they are $ 25,000 in debt. But they saw it as an opportunity opened up to them by General-Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms. `` Perestroika,'' the name given <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s modernization program, has changed the lives of people like Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> and her family and promises to touch millions more as the drive for a more efficient Soviet economy gathers steam. The small <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant run by Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> and her family is their own, with each member owning a share and getting a share of the profits. It is officially recognized as a cooperative. The <PERSON> Meikhua </PERSON> also is a model of what Soviet authorities had in mind when they loosened laws last year to permit cooperatives and individual labor, such as moonlighting, giving Soviet citizens an official touch of private enterprise. Opened Nov. 17, the <LOCATION> Meikhua </LOCATION> cafe is the only known family-run <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant in the whole of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which shares a 3,000-mile border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Operating a cooperative gets around a major theoretical hurdle, because anyone who does not work for himself or for the state is thought to be exploited by an employer. But the Meikhua cafe and other cooperatives face difficulties in offering alternatives to the state-run economy. Meals in the cooperatives are more expensive than in the multitude of state-run restaurants. Ingredients are hard to come by and consumer resistance is high because cooperatives' prices fluctuate with the market and availability. Among the co-ops that have sprung up under the new law are establishments that produce plastic beach shoes and children's jackets sewn from scraps in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> Others harvest fish, pick wild berries and repair apartments in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Kurgan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has a cooperative extermination service and a cooperative that refers callers to other cooperatives. About 70 co-op restaurants have opened in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which has a population of nearly 9 million. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told writers and editors in mid-January that 13,000 co-ops had been established and more than 300,000 people were working for themselves within the narrow confines of new regulations intended to encourage better supply, goods and services that in the state-run economy are notoriously slow and of poor quality. `` This is not particularly many for a country like ours, but nevertheless a step forward has been made,'' he said. Each new venture must be approved, granted a location and outfitted by local authorities and the state-run enterprises against whom the cooperative competes. Those who want to start a cooperative or work for themselves often report discouraging bureaucracy and heavy licensing fees. But Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON>, taking a break one recent morning from chopping vegetables and meat in the <PERSON> Meikhua </PERSON>'s kitchen, said the bureaucrats moved quickly in her case because <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had no cooperative serving Chinese food. That is one indication officials are more interested in providing a little variety than in fostering competition. Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON>, 27, a teacher of English and Chinese, was washing floors and cleaning tables on his day off from teaching. `` I come at 9 o'clock in the morning and do n't leave until 11 o'clock at night,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> said. `` And my son, he's teaching at school from 8 a.m. until 2 p.m.. Then when he's done at school, he comes here by 3 o'clock. `` We work a lot,'' she said. `` Honestly, it's hard.'' Main dishes at the Meikhua can cost from 2.90 rubles -LRB- about $ 4.75 -RRB- for a pork and cabbage dish to 8 rubles -LRB- $ 13.25 -RRB- for braised sea slugs, a specialty. The sea slugs must be marinated for several days and take several hours to prepare, Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> said. A five-ounce serving of rice costs 30 kopeks -LRB- 50 cents -RRB-. A few more kopeks brings a pot of jasmine tea. Service at the restaurant's nine tables was quick and friendly, and everything on the menu was available. At state-run restaurants, it often is easier to ask the waiter which of the dishes on the menu actually are available, and service is notoriously slow. Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> was born in northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> mother and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> father. She and her husband cook home-style food from her native region. <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON>, and another son, a daughter and son-in-law do everthing else. All but the 49-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> kept their old jobs or remained at their studies. The family would like to hire an extra cook and keep the cafe open longer than five hours a day, six days a week. But their intent to keep it essentially a family-run business fits well within the limited scope of the law. Asked if he would prefer to teach or run the cafe, <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON> said: `` I would like, if it was possible, to be more creative as a teacher, to work there. But it has been very interesting here so far. To create something is always interesting. Here it's possible to govern yourself fully.'' The family needed 15,000 rubles -LRB- $ 25,000 -RRB- to get started, and friends advanced some of the money to help them turn a former two-family apartment building into a restaurant. A bank lent more money at 3 percent interest, and government organization provided the kitchen equipment and furniture. The cafe's income is about 500 rubles -LRB- about $ 825 -RRB- a night, roughly half of which goes for food, heat and electricity. Family members are paid about 250 rubles -LRB- $ 413 -RRB- each a month, some 50 rubles -LRB- $ 82.50 -RRB- more than the typical Soviet factory worker. Because prices in cooperative restaurants are higher than in state-run restaurants, some Soviets grumble that the cooperatives are too expensive for the average citizen. In a recent article, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda printed several letters from readers complaining about prices at cooperatives. One letter writer, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherkashin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said cooperatives had not forced prices down by providing more competition but had driven them up. `` Who is it that makes the laws on prices _ the market, cooperatives, or the government?'' he asked. Cooperatives get the bulk of their food from farmers markets, where prices are unregulated and run substantially higher than state markets and stores. Supply, while still uncertain, is usually better in the farmers markets, particularly for fresh fruits and vegetables rarely found in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the long winter. `` We'd like to have a constant supply ... so we do n't have to depend on the market,'' <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON> said. `` If they are selling meat one day for seven rubles a kilogram and the next day for 12 rubles, our prices jump.'' To get the spices she needs for Chinese cuisine, Mrs. <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> travels occasionally to <LOCATION> Kirghizia </LOCATION>, a republic of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But some spices, she said, cost a ruble -LRB- $ 1.65 -RRB- a spoonful, adding more to the prices on her menu.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``A Tiger's Tale''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 If an award is given for silliest movie of the year, `` A Tiger's Tale'' is likely to have few serious competitors It's not offensive, not insulting _ just plain silly. And it's too bad because a lot of the ingredients in this romantic comedy had potential for something better. Ingredient No. 1 is <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON>, an actress with so much skill and innate dignity that she almost saves the film. But not quite. She is cast as Rose Butts, the divorced mother of a wild teen-age daughter in a nondescript <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town. Rose works as a nurse by day but spends her nights nursing lonely drunks. Into her bored, sad life comes her daughter's castoff teen-age boyfriend, <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON>, who becomes smitten with the mother and wo n't take no for an answer Thus begins an unlikely May-December romance between the naive 19-year-old boy and the middle-aged mom. But once the two begin to cuddle, no one seems to know what to do next, least of all scriptwriter <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who also directs. He diverts our attention to a few subplots. There's <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON>'s dilemma over whether to give up his pet tiger, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> -LRB- the most enchanting performer in this flick -RRB- And there's <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON>'s widowed father's dilemma over whether to marry again. The father, a retired veterinarian who keeps snakes around the house, is portrayed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON>, another gifted actor whose efforts are wasted here. Finally, a crisis is created to bring <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON> back in focus. It turns out that her daughter, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, enraged by Mom's unconventional affair, has had her revenge When she left to live with her father, she poked a hole in <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s birth control device. Can you guess the result? The rest of the plot is so preposterous you have to laugh. It should be mentioned that a major flaw from the outset is the lack of even the smallest spark of chemistry between Ann-Margret and her teen-aged lover, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a gangly, wholesome kid with a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accent who would seem more likely to fall in love with a horse. `` A Tiger's Tale'' is rated R for sexual subject matter.

<HEAD>Star Watch: It's Hard to Get a Fix on Tony Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hollywood has never been able to get a fix on <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, and that seems to be just the way he likes it. He graduates from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> in 1963 and steps into a star-making role as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s brother in `` Come Blow Your Horn.'' Just as his acting career is rolling, he turns filmmaker and co-produces `` The Sting,'' which won an Academy Award as best picture of 1973.

<TEXT>
 Concert pianist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> has loaded his Steinway on a van and is driving from town to town for his 1988 tour _ an unusual way for classical musicians to hit the road. `` It has n't been done this way for 50 years at least,'' <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> says. `` Paderewski -LRB- the Polish pianist and composer who died in 1941 -RRB- had a private railroad car. `` There are a lot of places on my tour where so-called ` big name' artists do n't go. The seating capacity of halls is small and people ca n't afford to pay very high fees.'' <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> is accepting what he terms `` reasonable'' fees. `` I'm playing in a lot of communities which would otherwise not hear me, on a magnificently prepared, superb piano, playing a good program. It's giving me a lot of gratification.'' From January through May, his solo piano recitals are east of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The western tour will start in September in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Marta </PERSON>, is artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is always on the move. Last fall, he played a recital in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, ate a sandwich in his hotelroom at midnight, arose at 5 a.m. to fly to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> where he boarded the Concorde to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He was met at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, handed a tuxedo, taken to rehearsals for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award show and played that night on the televised show to honor <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. `` You can not perform to your maximum ability, doing it this way, and I did n't,'' he said. `` It's the wrong way to do things.'' His intention now is to perform by making short hops from town to town for a few years or more. `` This tour is the right way to do things,'' he said. `` When you play, it does n't have to be only for the fancy swells and sophisticates. The same kind of people, who read the same kind of books and listen to the same kind of music, live in smaller towns.'' The tour began at a college in <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, with the second concert at a senior citizens center outside <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> has two programs. Program A includes <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, <PERSON> Debussy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>. He has recorded Program B for <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION>, a French company that releases compact discs. He calls it `` a bit more esoteric. <PERSON> Schumann </PERSON>'s ` First Sonata' is n't often played. It was written to murder the hands of pianists. It's terribly difficult and beautifully inspired, not the kind of piece you normally take on a barnstorming tour.'' He also will play <PERSON> Debussy </PERSON> and some infrequently heard <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON> on Program B. `` That's what my pianos really serve for,'' <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> said. `` These pieces require a sophisticated brand of piano playing I can offer with these instruments.'' <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> has been thinking about a tour such as the one he's doing for years `` I started playing at 17. I played 200 concerts in my first two seasons. I was soloist with the <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, paid $ 250 a week by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>.'' His first of more than 40 recordings was <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>'s `` D Minor Piano Concerto'' with the Busch players in 1945. `` I played concerts with umbrellas stuck under the sounding board and keys that would n't go down,'' he said. `` I would complain. People would say, ` He's a nasty young man.' The good part of it was that some very high-level music-making was done. I was part of it. I know we had a lot of success and people enjoyed the concerts.'' He'll probably give 100 concerts this year, too. `` I had the stamina half a century ago. I hope I have it now,'' the artist said. `` I'm 62. I feel like I'm 26 and hysterical. I think I never grew up. `` The concerts are strenuous but the traveling is easier these days.'' Cities are not more than 300 miles apart; <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> and the piano technician drive by car, and luggage oes in the van with the piano. `` I like playing in unpretentious circumstances,'' he said. `` Pretention is not the same as excellence. I think the public, wherever the town, is people who react to and feel what is happening. To me, that's the whole meaning of this trip. `` I'm not warming up for a program in some big hall. I've already played these pieces in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> I want to play in Winter Park, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the way I play in <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. `` Sometimes people ask me to sign a program they've saved 35 years. Those people touch me. I want to do something really nice for those people, for whom music really matters.'' <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON> played at a General Motors cancer research award dinner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1981. `` They sent me a check for $ 7,000, my regular fee. I sent it back, donating it to <ORGANIZATION> Sloan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kettering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. They were touched by that and said to let them know if there was ever anything they could do for me. When I started thinking about this tour, I thought maybe they would help me.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> designed a van, with a hydraulic lift and temperature control, to carry <PERSON> Istomin </PERSON>'s piano and is lending it to him free. The tour itself does n't have corporate sponsorship.

 You've heard it before and you'll hear it again: The success of your paint job will depend on how much time and effort you put into the preparation. It's nice to see the paint transform your lackluster walls and ceilings into gleaming brightness or unblemished freshness, but the pleasure will disappear quickly if you have n't prepared the surfaces properly. Proper preparation means freeing the interior of loose dirt, peeling paint, oil and grease. It also means spackling all cracks and holes with spackling compound or patching plaster. The patches should be primed before the final coat of paint goes on, but read the label on the paint can to determine the manner of treatment. Some professionals and many do-it-yourselfers apply a primer even when no patching has been done. It is especially important that any gloss be removed from the surfaces, since new paint does not adhere well to slick or shiny walls and ceilings. The gloss can be steel-wooled, sanded or given a coat of a special liquid that dulls the shine. Unlike a few years ago, oil and latex paints can be used fairly well over each other, but a primer will insure an excellent result. The assumption is that you will be using a good paint, since it is poor economy to choose a low-quality paint when it is your own `` elbow grease'' that is being utilized. Latex paints have little or no odor and make it easier to clean up after the job is completed. Follow the rule-of-thumb that a high gloss paint usually is more washable, resists moisture and wears well, which is why it is preferred in kitchens and bathrooms. Flat paints are the choice in most living rooms and bedrooms, being easier on the eyes. A semi-gloss paint is what the name implies, about halfway between the gloss and flat. The ideal way to prepare a room for painting is to remove everything from it, but this may be impractical. At least take out the lighter objects, moving the heavier pieces to the center of the room and covering them with a dropcloth or whatever is handy. All electrical switch plates, doorknobs, etc., can be taken off, but be extra careful about exposing any electric wires. Ceiling fixtures can be dropped slightly to make the painting easier. In a casual room, you might want to try unusual effects. There are special rollers to give you offbeat results. You can do the same thing by dragging or swirling brushes, whisk brooms, sponges and rags across the paint while it is still wet, keeping in mind that easy does it if you want to avoid a mess. To find out what kind of results these gimmicky styles of painting will produce, try practicing on something like a piece of scrap wallboard. When you have estimated the amount of paint you will need, it's a good idea to buy an extra amount For one thing, you always find something more you want to paint to blend in with the room. It may be only a bookcase or two, but if you have it on hand, it can be used at some later time for a touch-up job. Buying the same kind of paint at a future time does not always assure that the shade will be identical with the original. Some people just do n't order enough the first time because they do n't want to pay for unused paint. But many paint dealers will take back an unopened can if too much time has n't elapsed. Should you think that might be a problem, ask the dealer about the possibility. You may want to get on with the painting and not worry about whether you are trying to make a room seem larger or smaller, but if the latter concerns you, the proper color is the answer. Want to make something in a room `` disappear''? Paint it the same color as the room itself. Want to make it stand out? Paint it a contrasting color. If a room is long and narrow and you want it to seem a bit shorter, using white paint on two of the walls and a soft warm color on the two end walls will do the trick. When a side wall is painted white or a cool color, the room will appear to be wider. In the same way, a hallway that is too narrow can be made to seem wider if a side wall is painted white or cool. Warm colors _ red, yellow, red-orange, yellow-orange and variations of red _ make it cool. Thus, theoretically, rooms which get very little sunlight are best painted warm colors, those with lots of sunlight cool colors. In actuality, other factors, including the shapes of the rooms and their decorative features, usually affect the choice of colors, not to mention personal preferences.

 Painting the outside of a house is never easy, but there's a certain amount of satisfaction in watching the paint work its magic. But getting the surface ready for the paint is another matter. Caulking cracks, countersinking popped nails, scraping blistered and peeled areas, removing mildew, priming where necessary and performing the other preparatory steps all add up to plain work without the visual compensation of the actual painting. Yet you must perform the preliminary phase of the operation with some degree of dedication or you will pay for it later. A house not adequately prepared may look very much the same as one that has been given the full treatment, but it is only a question of time before the difference is seen. The let's - get-it-over-with process begins to peel, blister, check The take-your-time-but-do-it-right formula pays dividends in the form of a continuous good appearance. Poor paint, or the failure to handle the brush, roller or spray gun properly often gets the blame for what is nothing more than inadequate preparation. If you do not have the time or the inclination to get the house ready to paint, do n't do it. Check on whether the paint you plan to use will work well on the kind of surface you are covering. Oil-based, alkyds and oil-modified alkyds all are excellent for wood siding, but the majority of do-it-yourselfers prefer latexes because they have blister resistance and, since water is the solvent, they make cleaning up a lot easier. Once regarded as less likely to `` cover'' than other paints, they now have good hiding ability. Some can be applied even over a damp surface. Read the label on the container to see whether a primer is required, especially if the latex is being put over an oil paint designed to chalk. If brick or other masonry is being painted, be sure you have an exterior paint formulated for use on such surfaces. Oil paints do not work well on any material containing cement, which has an alkali content that attacks the paint. Exterior wood shakes or shingles usually are stained, although they can be painted. Once they have been stained, they should be stained again when a second treatment is necessary. While you can paint over stain at a later time, a careful priming is required to prevent bleeding. If you paint the first time, you can not stain later without removing the paint, which can be a messy job on shakes or shingles. When covering this kind of wood when a house is new, look over the various kinds of stains and pigmented sealers on the market. Manufacturers of some of the pigmented types say they are more durable than the clear coatings. Incidentally, you can get finishes with mildewcides in them or add a mildew-resistant compound to other finishes. As you paint, follow the sun; that is, paint where the sun just has been. In that way, you will not risk having the sun dry out the paint too quickly. It's also a lot more comfortable painting while in the shade. If you are using an extension ladder, use it with caution. Most accidents occur when a person leans over too far. Instead, get down and move the ladder. It may be a little more trouble and take a little more time, but it will keep you from getting hurt. Work from the top of a house, usually in the left hand corner, and continue downward. Always work in toward the wet paint, using wide, firm strokes. Dip the brush about halfway and pat off the excess on the side of the container. If you are using a roller, be sure it does not take up too much paint and do not spin the roller at the end of a stroke. With a roller, work from a dry area into a wet one. Color changes the seeming appearance of a house. If you want something to be inconspicuous, such as a garage door, paint it the same color as the main part of the house. A house looks smaller when it is painted with dark colors. Light colors, of course, have the opposite effect. When a house seems to be too tall, paint it the same color as the roof. If you want it to seem higher, paint the siding a contrasting color. If you have been content with the colors on your house over the years, do n't experiment. Choose the same or nearly the same colors.

 In painting indoors, rollers cover surfaces more quickly and easier than brushes, but brushes may be necessary for detailed work. Consider the use of edging rollers. Another possibility is the use of extension handles on the rollers so that you can paint the ceiling while standing on the floor. Should you do so, remember that you will avoid a stiff neck if you paint the ceiling area ahead of you rather than directly overhead. Do not overload the roller or apply too much pressure. And whether using a roller or brush, always paint from a dry area into a wet one, overlapping slightly.

 A sunspace can transform an ordinary room into an attractive, bright living space. It can also serve as a source of solar heat for your home and a place in which you can garden the year ` round Basically, a sunspace is a light-frame enclosure made of several components, including glass or other transparent glazing, aluminum or wood framing, windows, skylights and sliding glass doors. The words greenhouse, sunspace, solarium, and sunroom are used interchangeably to describe this structure. Pre-engineered sunspace kits are available in a variety of sizes and styles. Many manufacturers offer standard models suitable for most homes, budgets and tastes; a few offer the ability to give you the most exacting custom designs. Standard models come in wood or aluminum. They can be further classified by the shape of the eave _ the area where the sunspace roof meets the vertical wall _ which can be either straight or curved. Curved eaves have aesthetic and functional importance. From a stylistic point of view, curved glass gives you an unobstructed view normally interrupted by the roof edge in a straight eave sunspace. Functionally, the curved eave is an aerodynamic shape, making it more resistant to air leaks during high winds. Less air infiltration means an overall higher energy efficiency. The greenhouse kits available on the market provide a variety of standard options including: a range of glazing materials; insulated panels for the roof, endwalls and the basewall of the sunspace; operable glazed units; movable insulation and shading systems; thermostatically controlled ventilation systems; and thermal storage accessories. New technologies and a range of services and components make it a greenhouse shopper's paradise these days. There are also a variety of handbooks and solar construction manuals that offer guidance on `` do-it-yourself'' sunspace retrofits, using conventional building materials and off-the-shelf components. However, it is recommended that an architect, engineer or builder be consulted before you undertake any major alterations of your home. There are four major factors that will decide the sunspace right for you: location, use, size and cost. When planning your sunspace, start with the factor by which you are most constrained, and go from there. For example, if there is only one feasible spot for an addition to your house, then location will be the overriding factor. This will in turn affect the use of your sunspace; for example, the degree to which this location is facing south will limit your use of this addition as a solar heater. Beside increasing the overall value of your home, a solarium can be a great solar heater. In order to take the best advantage of this asset, the greenhouse glass should face true south. However, you can build a solarium facing as much as 45 degrees to the east or west of south and suffer only a 20 percent loss of winter sunshine. If you have several places on your south-facing wall where your solarium can be located, there are other considerations which will help you determine the best solar heater location. If your house is L - or U-shaped, try to locate the sunspace so that it is sheltered within this shape, to limit the heat loss through the endwalls of the sunspace While today's sunspaces usually perform one of three basic functions _ growing plants, solar heating, or providing shelter _ the shelter aspects are probably the most intriguing. The sunspace provides an attractive and sunlit living space that can house a myriad of activities. Most sunspaces serve several purposes. During the day, for example, a sunspace may have the dual function of collecting and storing heat while also providing a place to grow plants. In the evening, you and your family may enjoy it as an informal space. The warming sunshine streaming into your sunspace at certain times can overheat the room and create a costly additional load on your air conditioning system. Shading is one of the best solutions to this problem. The materials you select to shade your windows should be styled to fit the design scheme of your home, but must also perform well under the additional heat and light to which they will be exposed in your sunspace. Although most conventional window treatments such as draperies, blinds or shutters can be designed for your sunspace, the best protection will come from those systems that prevent the sun from ever reaching the glass. These systems include exterior awnings and sunscreens. Interior shading systems are most effective if they incorporate a good solar-reflecting surface material on the exterior side. This principle can be applied to traditional fabric shades, blinds, shutters and drapes. Insulated shades are a relatively new development in shading systems, designed to prevent heat loss in winter and at night and also used to reduce summer heat gain. The shades are composed of reflective liners, insulating batting and a decorative interior covering. Hardware includes an edge sealing system which dramatically cuts air leakage. Interior thermal shades are easier to operate and maintain than movable exterior insulation and are available with motorized and sun sensor controls.

 People with solariums and greenhouses can be happier and healthier than those who do n't have a steady supply of outdoor light, says a physiologist who is also a greenhouse franchisee. `` Natural daylight is a very beneficial ` drug-less' therapy for conditions ranging from gloomy moods on cloudy days to colds, muscular aches and pains and even, in some cases, migraine headaches,'' says <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondi </PERSON>. He operates a Four Seasons Greenhouses center in <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` Natural light also provides a healthful environment for people who exercise at home,'' he says. `` Doing aerobics or lifting weights in a solarium or greenhouse addition lets you exercise ` outdoors' while staying inside your home.'' Americans are spending more than $ 400 million a year to 40,000 new sunspaces on their homes, according to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Additions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, N.Y. He predicts it will grow to between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion in the 1990s. `` The sunspace has evolved from a greenhouse for indoor plant growing into a room central to modern homemaking,'' says <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. `` Today people are adding sunspaces for kitchens which once again have become a major focus for homemakers. `` People are even specifying room add-ons as bathrooms.''

 If you are remodeling your kitchen and thinking about putting in new cabinets, you might want to consider giving your old ones a facelift instead. As a do-it-yourself project, it can save you money and at the same time get the quality look that you want. A newly introduced solid oak kitchen cabinet refacing system packages contemporary-styled solid oak cabinet doors, drawer fronts and matching peel-and-stick oak veneer into a step-by-step procedure designed especially for the do-it-yourselfer and one that requires no special tools or carpentry skills. The system offers a variety of cabinet doors and drawer fronts to accommodate almost any kitchen cabinet you might have. Cabinet doors and drawer fronts both are three-quarters of an inch thick, with door fronts available in two panel styles. Cabinet fronts come in nine standard door sizes; drawer fronts are available in three sizes. Non-standard door sizes can be adjusted using framing strips. The refacing system also includes matching peel-and-stick oak veneer for application over all front cabinet frame surfaces and exposed ends. The veneer features specially formulated pressure-sensitive adhesive to provide easy application as well as durability. The refacing process is a four-step procedure that anyone with basic do-it-yourself skills can perform. Installing cabinet doors and applying the matching veneer is done as follows: 1. Remove all old cabinet doors, hinges and catches. 2. Match pre-selected doors with the appropriate cabinet door openings. 3. Apply peel-and-stick oak veneer over all old face frames and exposed side panels. 4. Apply the finish, add new hardware and complete the installation of the doors. Installing new drawer fronts involves a similar four-step procedure: 1. Remove all drawers from cabinets and take off all handles, knobs or raised moldings. It is not necessary to remove the existing drawer fronts themselves because the new solid oak ones mount over the old ones. The replacement drawer fronts come in three sizes which will accommodate nearly all drawer sizes. 2. Using a hand saw, cut off any lip or overhang on your existing drawer fronts so that they are flush with the sides, top and bottom of the drawer. 3. Line up the new drawer front so that it centers over the trimmed drawer and covers the drawer opening completely. 4. Apply the finish, then, from the face side of the new drawer front, drill holes so you can attach new drawer handles. In most instances the screws used to attach the handles will be adequate to secure the new drawer front in place. Complete the installation of the drawer fronts. According to <ORGANIZATION> Masonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which handles the refacing system, the average kitchen is composed of 15 cabinet doors and 11 drawer fronts which take between 16 to 24 hours to reface and finish. For the relatively few hours involved, refacing may be the answer for the do-it-yourself enthusiast. Another advantage is less disruption to the normal everyday use of your kitchen. While you are refacing your cabinets, you still have the use of them, and avoid the mess that comes when you tear out your old ones and replace with new ones.

 Most of the time we do n't do anything about the roof on the house until it does something to us. When there is a leak or storm damage, we move into action, hiring a professional or attempting a do-it-yourself repair. But when a roof needs replacement, the pro gets the call. Putting down a new roof not only requires knowledge and skill, it needs the attention of someone who knows how to move about safely on high ladders and sloped surfaces. One way a homeowner can aid his cause is to keep minor damage from becoming major. Check the roof periodically, a couple of times a year or more often when there is a reason for such an examination. The check is especially important if the roof is more than 15 years old. That's the time when a house is a prime candidate for reroofing, although the life expectancy of a roof can be longer than that if top materials are used. Remember that the cost of labor and application is often the same, regardless of the projected life of the roof. Checking the roof does not involve getting on it. You can do it from the ground with the aid of binoculars. Look for signs of wind damage. Cracked, curled, loose or missing shingles spell trouble. An excessive loss of granules from the shingles is a sign of wear. Even if you know very little about roofs, common sense will tell you when something does n't look right. Resist the temptation to get on the roof to check at close range. Leave that kind of inspection to a roofer. Since you are at the mercy of a roofing contractor to find out what is wrong and whether it can be fixed or replaced, find one who comes well recommended. If you are told your roof needs replacing, get more than one opinion on the problem and what it will cost to solve it. Be sure all contractors are bidding on the same plans and materials. Before signing a contract, be certain it specifies the work to be done and materials to be used, completion dates, warranties and guarantees of both the contractor and manufacturer, removal of waste materials, final price and method of payment. Among available roof coverings, asphalt shingles are the most widely used roof material. They are attractive, economical by comparison, and durable. There are endless varieties, among them the glass-based, three-dimensional, multi-layered, textured and other types. There is roll roofing for roofs with little pitch, built-up roofing, aluminum shingles, wood shingles and concrete and ceramic tiles, as well as slate and terne. Your roofer must decide whether your new roof can be applied directly over the old one. In most cases, asphalt shingles can be laid over asphalt and wood shingles. And some ordinances forbid reroofing over two or more layers of shingles. No matter what the regulations, your roofer has to determine whether your roof deck can support another set of shingles. A new roof should require only minimal maintenance. But keep gutters, downspouts and roof surfaces clear of leaves, twigs and other litter so that water will drain freely and not back up. Never allow water from one roof portion to pour directly on to another. Keep trees trimmed to prevent branches from scuffing or other damaging the roof. And, for your sake, as well as that of the roof, stay off it.

 Chain saws have become familiar workhorses around the home as homeowners use them to cut firewood and roots, clear storm damage and trim trees and large shrubbery. But many chain saw owners do not know how to take care of them properly and can end up with costly repair bills. A chain saw owner needs to perform an annual maintenance check to ensure trouble-free operation. Solo Inc. experts have developed a 10-step maintenance checklist that can be performed with a few standard tools and a little spare time. You are advised to check the owner's manual for specific maintenance instructions and to perform the procedures during the `` off'' season. For safety reasons, always wear gloves and safety glasses when following these steps in maintaining your chain saw: 1. Drain any remaining fuel from the saw's tank or run the engine until it is empty. 2. Using a garden hose, clean the entire unit while being careful not to get water into the gas tank. 3. Remove and clean saw chain, bar and guide bar. Do n't forget to wear gloves. 4. Remove spark plug and replace it with a new one every year. Be sure to set the correct spark plug gap. 5. Close the choke and remove the air filter assembly. Clean the filter with a stiff paint brush and soap and water or replace it if necessary. 6. Remove the fuel cap, locate the fuel pick-line inside the tank and `` fish'' it out. You may want to use an 8-inch piece of coat hanger that has a `` U'' bend at one end. Replace line or filter if dirty and put cap back on the tank. 7. Use an allen wrench or screwdriver to remove the starter assembly. Clean filter openings with a rag or brush, remove debris and replace any worn parts. 8. Visually inspect all vibration isolators to be sure they are not worn out, torn, cracked, broken or loose. Check manual for exact locations of isolators. 9. Check spark plugs arrestor screen for buildup and clean or replace if rips or performations are present. Clean with water or a wooden `` pop'' stick, making sure not to tear holes in the filter. 10. With gloves on, grasp muffler to check that it is not loose and does not rattle. Replace if necessary. When finished, double check to make sure all parts have been properly replaced, all screws and bolts have been tightened and there are no pieces left over.

 Keeping kitchen knives razor sharp and in mint condition is an art. With practice and patience, most people can master traditional techniques, but modern technology also offers simpler and more effective solutions to a drawer full of dull blades. `` However you choose to sharpen your knives, do it frequently, rather than once or twice a year,'' says chef <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchenot </PERSON>, gourmet and cooking instructor. `` In fact, for maximum effectiveness, knives should be sharpened after every use.'' The most popular tool for reviving dull knives is the butcher's or sharpening steel It is relatively easy to use, but does not actually sharpen a blade. Instead, it realigns the bent fibers of the blade and evens out the edge where they have broken off. The safest way to `` steel'' a blade is by grasping the knife in one hand and holding the steel perpendicular to a cutting board with the other. Then, position the heel of the blade _ the part closest to the handle _ at a 20-degree angle to the rod of the steel just below the handle. With a quick swinging motion, bring the knife down and across the steel until the tip reaches the bottom. Repeat the process with the other side of the blade. About six strokes on each side should complete the job. `` The trick to steeling is maintaining the proper angle and using a consistent amount of pressure throughout the process,'' says Buchenot, culinary consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Wilkinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sword </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` If you do n't, the edge will be uneven and perhaps too dull or so sharp that it will wear away quickly.'' An easier and more convenient alternative is a set of self-sharpening knives, which contains its own automatic sharpening cassettes and, unlike a steel, actually puts a new edge on a knife. Each knife's individual storage compartment contains one of these cassettes so that knives are automatically sharpened before and after each use. The cassette works similarly to many popular sharpening tools, but eliminates all the guesswork. It houses two angled tungsten-carbide sharpening blocks and is scientifically engineered to hold the blade at the correct angle as it is sharpened. A spring-load mechanism insures consistent pressure throughout the process. Sharpening takes place with one smooth continuous motion, ensuring an even edge. The knives are dishwasher-safe and virtually maintenance-free. Sharpening cassettes, however, may be removed from the unit and should be washed occasionally to remove any debris. However, if you are a die-hard do-it-yourselfer, you can try your hand at giving traditional knives a new edge yourself with a whetstone. Use a medium grade stone to start and finish with a finer grade. Lubricate each with honing oil or a half-and-half mixture of machine oil and kerosene. To sharpen, place the whetstone on a flat surface and hold the blade at one end of the stone at a 20-degree angle to its surface. With one smooth motion, bring the blade diagonally across the stone to the opposite end, gradually shifting pressure from the heel to tip of the blade. Turn the blade over and repeat the process starting at the other end of the stone. Continue with alternating sides until sharpened. `` Again, maintaining the correct angle and applying consistent pressure is important,'' says <PERSON> Bouchenot </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced it will begin purchasing a new type of adjustable rate mortgage which allows home buyers to convert their loans to fixed-rate mortgages. These convertible mortgages have become popular with home buyers because they offer the advantage of lower initial rates along with the chance to convert to fixed-rate mortgages later if rates drop. The action was announced by <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Brendsel </PERSON>, president of the corporation, which is popularly known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>. It follows a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, to purchase convertible mortgages as well. The two organizations, which purchase mortgages from local lenders, have a major impact on what will be available to home buyers because local lenders generally follow their guidelines in order to insure that their mortgages can be resold in the secondary market. The <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> announcement said it would buy convertible mortgages with rates that adjust yearly with caps of 1 percent to 2 percent on the amount interest rates can change in a single year. The convertible mortgages must also offer homeowners the option of switching from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed rate from the beginning of the first year of the mortgage to the end of the sixth year.

 Baths and kitchens top the list of rooms that homeowners choose to remodel, says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitchen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which projects that nearly 10 million consumers will replace one of those rooms in 1988. More than 5.5 million kitchens were remodeled last year, according to the association. `` Both rooms have a high return on investment when it comes time to sell a home,'' says <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, executive director of the trade group. Other reasons for what he says is a 14 percent increase over last year in the number of people remodeling those rooms include more discretionary income and a trend toward staying home. `` A good portion of that income is going into home improvements, particularly the kitchen and bath,'' he says. `` Consumers want all the options _ whirlpool tubs, steam features in their showers, ranges with grill features, wine coolers.'' The kitchen, in particular, may be becoming more personalized, say kitchen designers, who see it as a `` family activity center.'' `` Kitchens are expanding by combining several adjacent family areas, often spilling over into the great room,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hundley </PERSON>, marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Wilsonart </ORGANIZATION>, producers of decorative laminate surfacing. `` Kitchens are no longer used just for cooking, but have become areas to socialize, do the laundry, sew or work at the home computer.'' Kitchens are becoming more practical, says a designer, incorporating several areas into the same space. `` The laundry room might be a part of the kitchen, concealed behind doors, a desk area for the family computer, a baking center equipped with storage space for bulky mixing tools hidden behind tambour garages, an area for potting plants, a place to barbecue or even sew,'' says Gay Fly, president of Gay Fly Interiors, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Among the more popular remodeling plans for kitchens are those that remove the walls between the kitchen and family room, allowing plenty of space for socializing, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozic </PERSON>, vice president of builder sales for White Consolidated Industries, appliance manufacturers. The bathroom, too, is getting more remodeling attention, according to many manufacturers and designers. Some designers now consider the room a `` stress reduction center,'' complete with exercise equipment, sauna, whirlpool and television set. `` Oversized and two-person showers designed with multi-showerheads and controls are popular. Large closets and utility areas are also showing up,'' says designer Fly. `` Everything is designed to accommodate more than one person in the bathroom.''

 Finding a chip, gouge or hole on a piece of furniture does not mean it's ruined. Damaged furniture can be restored with a patching material made just for wood. Most furniture will receive some damage with heavy use. Chances are that furniture bought at a yard sale or auction will have at least one chip or gouge. Restoring furniture is simple, rewarding, and saves money on professional repair bills. The trick is knowing what materials to use and how to do the work. For your repair work, a premixed, synthetic compound gives good results. One kind is made of latex and pulverized wood for a patch of maximum workability and woodlike texture. For generations, cabinet-makers made their own patching material by mixing hot animal glue or vinyl resin with fine sawdust. Some purists still make their own wood patch, substituting woodworkers glue for animal glue. Synthetic latex compounds are easy to use. You apply them from the container with a putty knife, or directly into voids from a plastic squeeze tube. They can be nailed, sawed, sanded or drilled, and can be used for repairs both indoors and out. Patching damaged furniture, whether unfinished, painted or stained, is easy enough for any do-it-yourselfer. First, to remove dirt, grease, oil and loose particles from the damaged area, rub the surface with a lint-free cloth dampened with mineral spirits, paint thinner, or a liquid sander. Wait 30 minutes for the surface to dry, then dampen the area to be repaired with water. Water stops the wood from absorbing moisture in the latex wood patch. Otherwise, the patching material cures too quickly and might shrink and crack. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Molski </PERSON>, technical director of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gilsonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, offers these tips for using a latex wood putty: `` Press the patching material tightly into the void with a putty knife. Fill holes that are less than one-quarter inch deep and wide in one application. Make sure the patch is slightly higher than the surrounding wood. `` Wipe off the excess material around the hole with a dampened cloth. When the patch is dry, sand it until it's level with the surrounding surface.'' Holes more than one-quarter inch deep and wide, <PERSON> Molski </PERSON> says, should be filled with several layers of patch. Let each layer dry befre applying the next. Sand the repair, using medium-grade sandpaper attached to a sanding block. Failure to use a sanding block can result in ripples on the patch and surrounding wood. This is especially true when sanding softwoods like pine. Always sand with the wood grain. When done, wipe the surface with a tack cloth or clean rag dampened with mineral spirits to remove dust. The drying time for wood patching products differs. Read the label before sanding, painting or staining. Follow normal surface preparations before refinishing the damaged area. A refinishing tip: to improve the color match between the latex patch and the wood, mix some finish with the patching material before repairing the damage. Test the patch on an inconspicuous part of the wood _ the underside of a table, for instance _ to see if it blends with the original finish. If you have trouble matching the patch with a stained surface, mix a combination of maple, mahogany and walnut stain with the patching compond. With a little work, you can match almost any stain using these three colors. Do not confuse wood patching products with paste wood fillers. The fillers are designed for filling the open grains in certain hardwoods like oak, mahogany and walnut prior to finishing. Hiding minor scratches does not require the use of a wood patch. For a simple fix, rub a wet tea bag or shoe polish on the scratch. Specially designed wax sticks can also be used. They are available in different colors. If you're looking for the country look, repair major damage such as broken legs or rotted wood, but leave surface blemishes and minor scratches alone. These random markings give the piece its character.

 With warm weather coming, wood furniture and fixtures will need special care, advises wood care authority Homer Formsby. He offers these tips: _ To protect your furniture from the strong summer sun, keep furniture away from direct sunlight and rearrange your furniture so that one piece does n't receive all the exposure. Install drapes or shades that can be drawn during the sun's strongest hours. _ To protect furniture from high humidity, regularly apply a furniture treatment -LRB- not a furniture polish -RRB- to replace the wood's natural moisture -LRB- Do n't use linseed oil on wood, since it can darken, mildew and let off an unpleasant odor. -RRB- _ To protect furniture from summer dirt and dust, `` deep clean'' the wood by wiping the surface with mineral spirits or furniture cleaner on a cotton cloth, repeating until the cloth remains clean. Once the wood is thoroughly cleaned, regular use of a furniture treatment will clean everyday dirt and pollution. _ Avoid sitting on wood furniture in a wet bathing suit; the moisture can become trapped and leave white spots. To repair the spots, first let the furniture sit for 24 hours to see if the moisture evaporates on its own. If it does n't, buff the area with a 50-50 mixture of toothpaste and baking soda on a damp cotton cloth.

 The ABCs of home insulation usually come down to R. The letter stands for resistance to heat flow _ heat gain in the summer and heat loss in the winter. The higher the `` R-value'' of the insulation, the greater the insulating power. Determining what R-value is most effective in your home depends on the region and fuel sources. For example, in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, if you're insulating your attic and the energy source is natural gas, a minimum R-value of 30 is recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. Critical areas to be insulated include walls between heated and unheated areas, basement walls, floors above unheated crawl spaces and masonry walls in heated crawl spaces. `` Installing insulation is a relatively simple and inexpensive do-it-yourself project,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiberglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` One of the most common homeowner projects, insulating the attic, only costs about $ 300 to $ 350 for an average 1,000-square-foot space,'' he says. `` To insulate your attic,'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> says, `` the only tools you'll need are a sharp knife, a straight-edge, a measuring tape, a long-sleeved shirt, a mask, a pair of work gloves and safety glasses. Installation is simply a matter of measuring the area to be insulated, cutting the material to fit and laying between the joists or studs.'' The most common types of insulation are fiberglass batts and blankets, loose-fill, blown-in urethane foam, and rigid-board. Fiberglass batt and blanket insulation are the same material packaged differently. <PERSON> Batts </PERSON> are precut in floor-to-ceiling lengths, and blankets come in rolls that must be cut to length. Loose-fill insulation is made of fiberglass, rock wool, vermiculite or other mineral products that are either poured or blown into place with a high-pressure air nozzle. According to Better Homes and Gardens Building Ideas magazine, the advantage of loose-fill is that it seals around plumbing pipes and electrical wires and outlets and it can be blown into place without tearing out walls. But, the magazine notes, loose-fill tends to settle and compress over time and can lead to voids in the tops of wall cavities. Settlement is not a problem with foams, but shrinkage can affect the foam's airtightness, Building Ideas says.

 Power tools make do-it-yourselfing easier and faster, but every homeowner knows how impossible it is to take care of things around the house without various kinds of hand tools. For most purposes, you can get along without an electrical saw or a belt sander, but here are countless household tasks that can not be handled without a screwdriver or hammer or wrench or pliers. Whether you have an organized home workshop or merely a collection of tools that grew each time an emergency occurred, you know well the value of non-electric implements. There are some things you should keep in mind when hand tools are purchased and used. Here are a few of them: _ HAMMERS: A 16-ounce nail hammer is best for the novice, but it should not be used for masonry nails, cold chisels or other metal. For striking the very small hand chisels and punches and for riveting, shaping and straightening unhardened metal, use a 16-ounce ball peen hammer. A three-pound so-called drilling hammer of plastic, rubber, wood or rawhide is needed if you work with surfaces that could be damaged by a metal striking face. _ SCREWDRIVERS: You will need several screwdrivers of different sizes. While they should be of the standard slotted type, it is well to own at least one <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> screwdriver, which works with cross-slotted screwheads. When possible, buy a set of screwdrivers rather than one. _ WRENCHES: If you can get only one, make it an adjustable type, which has smooth jaws and fits different kinds of nuts. But it is not intended to replace fixed opening wrenches for many jobs. For instance, never use an adjustable wrench to free a `` frozen'' nut or for final tightening. A wrench should be tightly adjusted to the nut and pulled _ never pushed _ so the force is on the side of the fixed jaw. Never use an extension or a hammer on any wrench handle. _ PLIERS: Slipjoint pliers are what you should have if you have only a small collection of hand tools. Their joints allow the jaws to be adjusted to two positions. Later, you can buy some of many specialty pliers on the market. _ SAWS: The crosscut saw is the one you will use most. Backsaws are for precision work. Hacksaws are for metal. Very useful is a `` nest'' of saws, which has three narrow blades interchangeable on one handle. Two of the blades are known as keyhold saws, the third is for general cutting. _ CHISELS: Wood chisels are, as the name implies, for use on wood. Cold chisels are designed for use on metal and usually are driven with a heavy hammer. _ PLANES: A jack plane is the most common. It is 12 to 15 inches long and handles most jobs. _ FILES: The 12-inch size, with second-cut or smooth-cut teeth, is the all-purpose file. Files come in many varieties, but the type used on wood is called a rasp. There are, of course, many other hand tools, but you will find out about these when you have a need for them. In all cases, follow the rules of safety. Whenever practical, use workman's gloves. Always wear goggles or some other kind of eye protector when working with metal or doing anything which may cause chips to fly. And remember that dull tools cause more accidents than sharp ones.

 Housing construction for 1987 dropped to 1.62 million units, the slowest building pace for the housing industry since the recession year of 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. The total compared to construction of 1.81 million units in 1986, which had been an exceptionally strong year for the industry. In 1982, 1.06 million units were built. Analysts blamed much of the weakness on widespread overbuilding in the apartment sector and the adverse effects of the new tax law on real estate investments. Building permits for the year totaled 1.54 million units, 13.1 percent below 1986 and the weakest showing since 1982.

 About 6,000 employees began a strike Monday over a pay dispute at Land-Rover, the first walkout against the state-owned automaker in about six years. It was also the second job action against the British automaking industry this month. Production was resuming Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> following a two-week stoppage. About 1,000 workers set up picket lines at the gates of the state-owned Land-Rover plant at <LOCATION> Solihull </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION>. Huge traffic jams, some more then a mile long, nearly blocked roads leading to the plant as the pickets stopped supervisors and office workers in their cars and urged them not to cross the picket line.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> is set to raise the curtain on hearings into the problem of hunger plaguing the nation's homeless and families living in poverty. `` I know that the budget pressures will remain with us all this year and for the foreseeable future,'' the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Democrat says. `` But <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future depends on its children. The wealthiest, most powerful nation in the world must once again resolve to eliminate hunger in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The hearings, set to begin March 1, will come as the government prepares to suspend distribution of milk, cheese, rice and honey to low-income households under the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, because stocks are depleted. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> says a report will be released this week dealing specifically with the rural poor and that he intends to follow up with hearings on the overall extent of hunger in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. TEFAP is best known as the program under which poor people were able to go to community action centers and other designated places in their neighborhoods to receive free allotments of powered milk and cheese. It came into being in 1981 as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wrestled with enormous surpluses of agricultural commodities and the massive storage costs they entailed. Those huge surpluses have now been diminished considerably by price changes under the 1985 farm law that have discouraged excess production. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Feb. 12 that dwindling stocks will prevent <ORGANIZATION> TEFAP </ORGANIZATION> distributions of milk and cheese in May. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and honey stocks will be depleted by March distributions, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said flour, cornmeal and butter distributions will continue as before. `` Cheese, nonfat dry milk, rice and honey distributions will be suspended when we have given it all away,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bode </PERSON>, assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services. `` When we get more, we will distribute it.'' The department said that one in every seven Americans receives federal food assistance at some point each year at a taxpayer cost of more than $ 56 million a day. It said surplus foods amounting to 5 billion pounds worth more than $ 5 billion have been distributed under TEFAP since 1981. According to figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, more than 15 million people have supplemented benefits they already receive from the food stamp program with TEFAB commodities. But the panel says the 18 million people who were taking part in the food stamp program as of September represented no more than 60 percent of those living in poverty. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said he went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last week `` to survey for myself the extent of hunger in our nation's richest city.'' `` As a senator, I have seen poverty in the Third World that was worse than any I have seen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said in a floor speech reporting on his trip. `` But the sense of hopelessness that I encountered in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> was as deep as any that I have encountered in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He said many families told him they `` can not buy enough food _ even with food stamps _ to feed their children.'' He quoted <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, operator of a food stamp hotline, as saying her organization receives thousands of calls from households that run out of food stamps. `` That they run out is not surprising,'' he said. `` The average food stamp benefit is around 50 cents, per person, per meal _ the maximum benefit is 81 cents per meal. `` Think about what 81 cents worth of groceries would look like _ not much. What would happen if you spilled a carton of milk _ or dropped a carton of eggs?'' Some individuals living in poverty are unable to obtain food stamps because they have no address, he said. He also recounted the experience of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> mother of six whom he identified as <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> who was having difficulty in storing perishables because her refrigerator was broken. He said she tried to keep milk and eggs cold by placing them next to the window but lived in fear that rats would get at them.

 Stock prices showed no clear trend today as traders awaited new signs of the outlook for the economy and interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.80 to 2,008.79 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 654 up, 615 down and 482 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 52.26 million shares at midmorning. Analysts said traders were looking ahead to congressional testimony Tuesday by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Several statistical reports are also due this week on such subjects as durable goods orders, the consumer price index and personal income and consumption. Of special interest to Wall Streeters is the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s revised figure for the gross national product in the fourth quarter of last year, scheduled to be issued Thursday. The department earlier estimated GNP growth, after adjustment for inflation, at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the October-December period. Many analysts believe the new figure will be higher.

<HEAD>Holding Company Denies Merger, Acquisition Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ran full-page advertisements in local newspapers today reiterating that it was not involved in merger negotiations and blaming seasonal and anticipated factors for its shrinking deposits. The advertisements seek to reassure depositors of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest bank holding company, which has been plagued by huge losses stemming from its portfolio of troubled loans. `` During the past few days, there have been several articles and news stories about the current state of our bank,'' the ad stated. `` Many of the items reported in these articles have been misleading and some just plain wrong. Consequently, we feel it necessary to respond to these reports.'' Since <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 656.8 million loss on Jan. 19, there have been questions about its ability to weather anticipated losses from its $ 3.9 billion portfolio of troubled loans. Speculation in the financial markets last week sent First RepublicBank's common and preferred shares tumbling and helped disrupt its system for raising deposits. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON> issued a statement denying the reports. The company `` is not involved in merger or acquisition discussions with anyone. Also, we are not aware that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with any other parties regarding our company.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> had assured <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> `` that its policy is to advise the institution before engaging in such negotiations.'' The advertisement addresses three points: merger rumors, deposit safety and deposit activity. `` There have been several misleading newspaper stories concerning our bank's recent deposit activity,'' the advertisement stated. `` Through mid-February, the corporation's average total deposits have only declined by approximately 4 -LCB- percent this year. More than half of the reduction was an expected decline in foreign deposits, with the balance due primarily to normal seasonal factors.'' The bank represents only one-third of the corporation's total deposits, Fronterhouse said. The letter encouraged <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> customers to call if they had further questions.

<HEAD>Consumer Products Company Files In Bankruptcy Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says the company will be stronger after it emerges from bankruptcy reorganization because of the strength of its consumer products business. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON> said two of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Almet-Lawnlike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, are profitable and would not have had to file for reorganization were it not for the parent company's complex financial situation He said that including Almet-Lawnlike, <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION>'s net worth, or assets minus liabilities, is about $ 400 million. `` <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> is very healthy, as evidenced by its excellent results for the first four months of this fiscal year and by its strong backlog of orders,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Travers </ORGANIZATION>, chairman since 1986. The Pittsburgh-based holding company and some of its subsidiaries, filed Saturday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for protection from its creditors while it reorganizes. Also included in the filing are <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chemetron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Drahuschak </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Singer, said the filing announcement was `` no horrendous surprise. `` It's probably the best operating move they had, given their credit situation and the need they had for operating capital,'' he said. `` This gets the banks off their backs for a while. Unfortunately, the sacrificial lamb in this process is the common shareholder.'' <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it has lined up fresh financing of $ 175 million from two major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks, <ORGANIZATION> Travers </ORGANIZATION> said. The credit line provides enough cash to run the companies during the reorganization, he said. `` Chapter 11 provides the means to implement corporate restructuring and continue the company's profitable turnaround,'' <ORGANIZATION> Travers </ORGANIZATION> said. The bankruptcy court petition was a key to getting the additional money, said Chief Operating Officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Albani </PERSON>. While negotiations with the two banks occurred before the filing, the financing was made afterward. Legally, that puts the lenders in a `` superpriority'' position ahead of other creditors, <PERSON> Albani </PERSON> said. The total liabilities of the company and its subsidiaries, which include such items as payroll and accounts payable as well as bank debt, are about $ 845 million. Its tangible assets are about $ 735 million. Total debt alone for the parent company and its subsidiaries amounts to $ 525 million, of which $ 175 million is in short-term bank loans and $ 350 million is in various long-term commitments. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> lost about $ 200 million from 1985 to 1987, largely due to debt incurred through a spree of acquisitions in prior years as well as heavy losses in real estate, gas and oil and credit operations. Under a new management team since <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> resigned under pressure in 1986, the company has shed 19 subsidiaries and severely cut its corporate overhead. The efforts bore fruit in the first quarter of fiscal 1988, which ended Dec. 31, 1987, when the company posted a profit of $ 7.25 million _ its first in two years. Profits from consumer products amounted to $ 31.5 million in the quarter, compared with $ 19.2 million for the same period in 1986. The filing does not affect <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer products operations in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, according to the company. It also does not affect industrial and high technology companies that <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is in the process of divesting. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, prior to 1981, was known as <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludlum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. The company acquired <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that year for $ 534 million. Consumer products manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> includes small household appliances, electric blankets and barbeque grills. Almet-Lawnlite manufactures lawn and patio furniture.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Long-range bullish attitudes prevailed in the grain and soybean pits, and little selling pressure surfaced this morning after last Friday's steep sell-off just before the close. `` Everybody that needed to get out got out on Friday,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Now they're all gunning again, coming back for more.'' Supportive fundamentals included relatively light farmer selling of grains over the weekend and dry weather in the soybean-growing region of southern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 3.22 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.01 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 6.34 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures mostly were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .42 cent higher with April at 73.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .30 cent higher with March at 83.35 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .43 cent higher with April at 44.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .58 cent higher with February at 53.85 cents a pound. All livestock futures settled higher on Friday while frozen pork bellies ended lower.

<HEAD>CFTC Probing Fraud Allegations Against 22 CBOT Traders: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has notified 22 traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> staff will recommend civil charges of prearranged and fraudulent trading against them, according to a published report. But some of the traders involved say the trading technique in question is practiced daily on many commodity exchanges and is not prohibited by the exchanges' rules, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that regulates futures exchanges, would neither confirm nor deny the report. `` The only enforcement action the commission will comment on is a publicly filed complaint,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The case, reportedly involving trading at the world's biggest market for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures, may be one of the largest single instances of alleged futures trading violations. The Journal said the allegations concerned certain trades made in the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures pit in mid-1986. The traders maintained that the type of trading being investigated _ loosely known as a `` ginzie'' trade, where a customer gets two different prices for portions of the same buy or sell order _ is widespread on futures exchanges, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> notifications are part of a procedure designed to give potential defendants a chance to argue to the commission that it should not follow its staff's recommendations. The traders received the notices last Wednesday and Thrusday and were given two weeks to respond with the written arguments to the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, the Journal reported.

 The number of oil and gas rigs working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose by 10 this week to total 978, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. This week's total reflects the number of rigs working as of last Friday. A year ago the count was 839, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> stated. The previous week, the rig count had dropped by 18 to total 968. The rig count usually declines during the first few months of the year. Houston-based <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, and not rigs producing oil. The rig count is the most widely-watched industry index of drilling activity. <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which merged this year with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the count reached a peak with 4,500 active rigs. But in the summer of 1986, the rig count fell to 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures _ as oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel. Among the major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gained 12 rigs this week, followed by <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 10; <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, three; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, two; and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, one. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> posted the largest decrease, losing five. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> lost two each; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> lost one each.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor who said he lost $ 500,000 because of an insider-trading scheme.

The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charged that some traders in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> stock and options benefitted illegally from insider information about the deal between Sept. 21 and Oct. 1, 1981. The defendants in the case agreed to surrender $ 7.8 million in profits to some 1,900 investors. A federal judge approved the settlement in 1986. <PERSON> Olaques </PERSON> challenged the settlement, arguing that he was excluded improperly from recovering $ 500,000 in losses. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled against him last May. The appeals court upheld a judge's decision that <PERSON> Olaques </PERSON> did not qualify for any money from the settlement because his investment took place before the insider trading scheme occurred. The appeals court said <PERSON> Olaques </PERSON> was not entitled to intervene in the settlement after it has been approved. He `` should not expect to be able to stand aside and watch others incur the expenses of lengthy litigation and then upset the results of those efforts,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Olaques </PERSON> said he was hurt by the insider-trading scheme even though he purchased options on <ORGANIZATION> Sante </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> stock before Sept. 21, 1981. He said the options did not expire until Oct. 6, 1981. The case is Olaques vs. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, 87-769.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell Monday against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar in listless European trading. Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after slipping in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.

While recent reports that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit had narrowed had supported the dollar, dealers said there were no new incentives to keep it from falling. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7630 from $ 1.7505 late Friday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to close at 129.95 Japanese yen from 130.53 yen on Friday. In later trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar slipped to 129.27 yen.

 For the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged publicly that the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and some of its employees face civil charges. The investment firm also confirmed it has been under investigation by a federal grand jury.

Such information routinely is required in prospectuses to warn would-be investors of potential risk. The document describing the fund was dated Feb. 16 and mailed to investors last week. It stated <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had advised the fund about the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff recomendations for civil actions against the firm and against some employees `` relating to transactions, some of which may have involved ` high yield' bonds.'' `` No assurance can be given that the results of any such <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> action or grand jury investigation will not have an adverse effect on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and-or the market for ` high yield' bonds, a market in which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is an important participant,'' the prospectus said Despite the caveat, sales of the fund apparently were unaffected on Friday, its first trading day, when it closed unchanged at $ 10 per share. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, on Monday declined to comment outside of the information contained in the prospectus. In January, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and several ranking employees _ including junk-bond chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> _ reportedly were informed that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff had decided to recommend charges of violations of security laws. On Jan. 27, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said the focus of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> involved possible violations of securities laws in corporate takeover situations, particularly `` stock parking'' _ the hiding of true ownership of stock in someone else's The practice can be used to evade <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> reporting requirements. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the employees have lodged their opposition to the decision with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, but the federal agency had not decided whether to proceed, according to the prospectus. The firm previously has acknowledged that an investigation was under way, but it has maintained that no wrongdoing took place. The prospectus says <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has furnished documents to a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and some employees have appeared before the panel. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has been the object of government scrutiny since the breaking of the scandal surrounding former arbitrager <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, because of the firm's extensive involvement in financing of corporate takeovers involved in the scandal.

 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Monday after a late sell-off on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A mixed opening was followed by firmer prices across the board, but the gains did not hold up.

Since then, AstroTurf surfaces have been installed in hundreds of sports stadiums and athletic fields around the world. <PERSON> Balsam </PERSON> has offered jobs to `` essentially all'' of the businesses' 100 employees and will keep its management team intact, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brasfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Balsam </PERSON> is the multinational market leader and manufacturer of sports and recreational surfaces, and has been serving as <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>'s European and <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> distributor for AstroTurf recreational surfaces.

<HEAD>High Court Upholds Limits on Local Cable TV Regulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday upheld a ruling that sharply curtails the power of communities to regulate cable television, while raising doubts about the constitutionality of a key federal law governing cable operations. Separately, the justices agreed to hear appeals by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and coal mining companies trying to block the possible award of billions of dollars in black lung disease benefits to thousands of miners. In the cable television case, the high court cited a lack of jurisdiction in turning away an appeal by <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atherton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which were barred from enforcing public access and other rules challenged by cable operator <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But the court's action apparently was based on narrow procedural grounds and leaves open the possibility of a subsequent appeal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> ruled last September that cable regulations adopted by the two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities unconstitutionally violated <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION>'s free-speech rights. The lower court had thrown out regulations requiring the company, among other things, to wire the entire community to make service available to all residents and to use a `` state-of-the-art'' system to keep pace with the latest technological advances. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who previously had ordered city officials to award an operating license to Century Federal, called for further hearings to study franchise fee requirements adopted by the cities. Palo Alto and <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON> officials said the ruling appears to declare unconstitutional a 1984 federal law regulating cable TV, even though the judge did not say in so many words that he was invalidating the law. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in a `` friend-of-the-court'' legal brief filed by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, urged the high court to deny the cities' appeal. In the case involving black lung disease benefits, the high court said it will review a ruling that the government must reopen some previously rejected claims for benefits. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration maintains the ruling by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, if extended nationwide, could force officials to re-examine 94,000 claims at potentially tremendous cost to the overburdened fund that pays benefits to miners afflicted with the disease. The lower court had ruled last March that thousands of miners seeking the benefits had been unfairly denied a hearing. The ruling applied to miners with less than 10 years of work in the mines whose claims were denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> must take a fresh look at the claims under liberalized standards adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. The appeals court applied the ruling to miners who failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or who missed deadlines for filing court appeals. In other business-related action Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Agreed to study a key affirmative action issue _ the power of local governments to require minority participation in public works projects The justices will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, officials seeking to revive a so-called set-aside program for construction industry businesses owned by minorities. _ Agreed to decide whether states may tax any income from oil and natural gas extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> challenging an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> tax. _ Agreed to decide whether a 5 percent tax <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> imposes on all telephone calls charged to in-state numbers interferes with interstate commerce <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is involved in the suit. _ Let stand a ruling that forces <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, officials to justify in federal court a zoning ordinance limiting where adult bookstores may be opened for business _ Rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, investor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olaques </PERSON> who said he lost $ 500,000 because of an insider-trading scheme The court let stand a ruling excluding Olaques from receiving any money from a $ 7.8 million settlement of the case, which stems from a proposed merger between <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1981.

 The <ORGANIZATION> MidAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> have agreed to a $ 3.51 million settlement ending all fraud litigation against <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION>, the exchange announced Monday. Under the agreement, $ 3.01 million will be paid directly to defrauded customers, whose losses totaled more than $ 51 million in 1984, the exchange said in a news release. MidAm will retain <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 500,000 guarantee deposit and the now-defunct firm waived all claim to those funds, the news release stated. <LOCATION> MidAmerica </LOCATION> in 1986 found that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> had violated exchange rules through its use of promotional materials, fraudulent and misleading sales practices and its withdrawal of guarantee funds on deposit with the exchange. The exchange expelled the company and fined it $ 3.51 million. First Commodity later went out of business. `` Plaintiffs in the class action applaud the MidAm's efforts and contributions in helping settle the largest reported class action commodity fraud settlement to date,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, one of the plaintiffs' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorneys. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION>, could not be reached to comment immediately on the settlement. An answering service collected requests for comment from the defunct firm. `` The MidAm Board of Directors felt this settlement met all the objectives of the exchange, the futures industry, and the needs of defrauded investors,'' said <LOCATION> MidAmerica </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>. The agreement stipulates that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 3.01 million to a settlement fund to be administered by the federal district court in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where investor cases were consolidated. The fund will be used to compensate those investors for some of their losses. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` has preliminarily approved a settlement class of potentially defrauded <ORGANIZATION> FCCB </ORGANIZATION> customers eligible for compensation. This settlement raises the amount in the fund to a currently estimated $ 5.3 million,'' the exchange stated. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Murschel </PERSON>, an exchange spokesman, said he did not know how many investors were involved, but the release said `` virtually every FCCB customer lost money, most of them losing 50-90 percent of their investments. `` Customer out-of-pocket losses in 1984 totaled in excess of $ 51 million, nearly $ 30 million of which went to <ORGANIZATION> FCCB </ORGANIZATION> in the form of commissions,'' the exchange said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the union representing 4,500 ground employees in 14 cities remained in a stalemate Monday following the breakup of their talks, and Teamster leaders vowed `` guerrilla war'' against the financially troubled airline. Travel agents reported that some customers have shunned <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights as a result of the conflict, which was sparked after the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' strike deadline passed at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. Talks in which management was seeking $ 35 million in concessions from the union broke down Sunday afternoon. No negotiating sessions were held Monday. The union, which represents reservation clerks and other ground staff, put off a strike. But Teamster leaders threatened to use disruptive tactics against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a Northeast corridor air shuttle and other services. Labor unrest also escalated at another major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline.

Sources close to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were pessimistic about the prospects for a negotiated resolution of the conflict with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can strike -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- any time we want,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' airline division. `` We're going to pick our strategic time.'' In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Genoese </ORGANIZATION> said, `` there's guerrilla war at all the airports. ... The passengers are really going to suffer in this situation.'' He said the tactics would include deliberately misdirecting baggage and cargo and canceling passengers' reservations <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said there was no evidence so far of such disruptions. `` The operation is running smoothly,'' <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. `` There is no evidence of any job action of any sort at any station.'' She said `` nothing very dramatic'' had happened at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s major hub. The company has said it would maintain operations with replacement workers in the event of a strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday not to support a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' strike, and pilots, flight attendants and flight engineers are not expected to honor picket lines. `` There have n't been any problems whatsoever,'' said <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenzi </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> pilots union's Master Executive Council, noting that he piloted a flight Sunday from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> without incident. Not all travelers appear to be reassured, however. `` It's a very bad situation for everybody,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> DMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` Some people are shying away -LRB- from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said his agency has been using double bookings as an insurance technique for customers booked on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights. For passengers taking <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> airport to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Monday night, for example, he also booked them on flights offered by other airlines to the same destinations. `` I think we have to go on the assumption that if there is a strike, all -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- flights will be shut down,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cammisa </PERSON>, a travel industry consultant, estimates that a threatened strike against an airline generally reduces bookings for the carrier by about 10 percent to 20 percent. `` Any kind of strike threat erodes bookings,'' <PERSON> Cammisa </PERSON> said, noting that the same thing has happened with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with a history of labor troubles. `` The public is very concerned about the turmoil -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> is -RRB- having with their unions,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffenberg </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The loss of bookings resulting from the conflict, he said, `` is going to be enough to drain the company and put them into bankruptcy.'' Towers, a debt-collection and insurance holding company based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has said it intends to launch a takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' backing. Towers owns about 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shares, out of a total of around 139 million shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had a net loss last year of $ 265.3 million on revenue of $ 2.9 billion, following a 1986 loss of $ 462.8 million on revenue of $ 2.5 billion. The company recently signed agreements on more than $ 330 million in concessions with the unions representing pilots, flight engineers and flight attendants. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also went through a major management shakeup a month ago: Its new chairman, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, briefly headed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and also worked at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The Teamsters represent workers at airports in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ran full-page advertisements in local newspapers Monday blaming shrinking deposits on seasonal factors and foreign withdrawals and repeating denials that it was involved in merger or bailout negotiations. In an open letter to customers, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> stated that recent news reports on the financial condition of the state's largest bank holding company were wrong or misleading The advertisement was aimed at depositors, whom the company feared might begin withdrawing funds due to the reports because of concerns about deposit safety. `` During the past few days, there have been several articles and news stories about the current state of our bank,'' the ad says. `` Many of the items reported in these articles have been misleading and some just plain wrong. Consequently, we feel it necessary to respond to these reports.'' Since <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 656.8 million loss Jan. 19, rumors have spread about its ability to weather anticipated losses from its $ 3.9 billion portfolio of troubled loans. Speculation spread to financial markets last week, sending First RepublicBank's common and preferred stocks tumbling and disrupting its system for raising deposits. The bank said in a statement Sunday that 88 percent of its funds come from core deposits, gathered through its system of 134 branches and subsidiary banks. At year's end, <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> had $ 1.93 billion in foreign deposits, representing about 7.5 percent of its funds. Total deposits as of Dec. 31 were about $ 24.5 billion, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsh </PERSON>. Assets totaled $ 33.2 billion, making <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> the nation's 14th-largest bank holding company at yearend 1987. First Republic stated it lost slightly more than $ 1.1 billion in deposits since the end of 1987. First Republic Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON> said about half the withdrawals _ nearly $ 550 million _ were at the lead <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank. `` Through mid-February, the corporation's average total deposits have only declined by approximately 4 -LCB- percent this year,'' the company's ad said. `` More than half of the reduction was an expected decline in foreign deposits, with the balance due primarily to normal seasonal factors.'' The Wall Street Journal reported in its Monday editions that federal regulators were preparing a possible $ 4.5 billion rescue. Fronterhouse said in the statement issued Sunday that the institution was unaware of any efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to arrange an assisted merger for the bank holding company, the nation's 13th largest. `` Furthermore, that agency informed us that its policy is to advise the institution before engaging in such negotiations,'' Fronterhouse said. An <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> official said the agency `` would be less than responsible'' if it did n't prepare contingency plans for a troubled bank. First RepublicBank's ad also addressed the economic condition in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which leads the nation in bank failures. `` These are not the best of times for any of us in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But we are totally committed to serving your needs and contributing to your success. We are here for the long term,'' read the letter signed by Fronterhouse, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Musolino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>, vice chairmen.

 The dollar drifted lower Monday against most other currencies in listless trading that analysts said reflected uncertainty about the outlook for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and interest rates. Gold prices were narrowly mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 444.25 a troy ounce, down 75 cents from Friday's late bid. Traders looking for clues about whether the economy was expanding or falling into a recession are focusing on reports due later this week when the government makes its latest revised estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth and issues reports on consumer prices, income and spending in January. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, currency analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the currency market was being pulled in opposite directions. He said the market had been heartened by two consecutive monthly declines in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, which could indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may not have to encourage lower interest rates to assure continued progress in reducing the imbalance. But <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said dollar traders remain concerned that the trade deficit still was too large for comfort. He said there has been speculation that European central banks sold dollars last week, inhibiting the currency's rise, in an effort to maintain stable foreign exchange rates. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 129.95 Japanese yen from 130.53 yen on Friday. In later trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar slipped to 129.27 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 129.35 yen from 130.05 yen Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7630 from $ 1.7505 late Friday. The pound finished at $ 1.75925 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.7495 last Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.69785 West German marks, down from 1.7080; 1.39275 Swiss francs, down from 1.3980; 5.7410 French francs, down from 5.7755; 1,249.50 Italian lire, down from 1,256.75; and 1.27225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2737. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.6955 West German marks, down from 1.7075; 1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.3985; 5.7500 French francs, down from 5.7675; 1.9040 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9150; 1,252.25 Italian lire, down from 1,257.75, and 1.2738 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2702. Gold prices edged up in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but slipped in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell 20 cents a troy ounce to $ 444.90 from $ 445.10 last Friday.

 A supercomputer company announced Monday it would keep its home in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, less than a month after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced its plans to close an auto plant in the state with 5,500 workers. The decision by <ORGANIZATION> Supercomputer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> ended a battle with neighboring <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to attract the company, which is developing fast, high-powered computers. The company was started by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION> after he left <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in September. The state of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> will help Supercomputing Systems to secure $ 25 million in private loans. The city of <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION> will provide a $ 27 million incentive package by selling a building at a reduced cost, applying for development grants and helping raise money to secure other loans. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s announcement came after the <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Monday to offer a $ 25 million backup aid plan if problems arise with the state's share of the package. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced Jan. 27 its plans to halt <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> auto production by Sept. 30. State and local officials have accused the company of breaking an oral promise to keep the plant open for five years, but company officials have said they made no such promise. The city was concerned about offering incentives after witnessing the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> problems, but decided the situation was entirely different, said <ORGANIZATION> Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION> city council president. `` You do n't get an opportunity, especially in this part of the country, to attract a large business, especially this state-of-the-art company, too often,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said.

Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> to divest either the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>'s action will affect <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s rival bid of more than $ 1.25 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Joele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which handles <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations. `` <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is planning to ask the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> to choose which company should acquire the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, based on which would serve the public interest the best,'' she said. `` They will ask that the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> consider whether the bidder helps the competition, and also is willing to pay a higher price.'' Ms. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION> should be aided in the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> deliberations by having the higher offer. <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> officials equally were confident their proposal would win <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> approval. `` We are confident that the commission will find this single-line system covering both the southern and central rail corridors will enhance competition for the benefit of shippers and the public,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> chairman and chief executive officer. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, chairman of the equity fund, said: `` The financial commitment we are making is the strongest statement possible about our confidence in the long-term viability of this venture.''

<HEAD>Henley Proposes Santa Fe Scrap Part of Restructuring, Sell It More
Stock</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dissident investor <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> proposed Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> scrap part of its financial restructuring and instead sell $ 780 million in new stock to <LOCATION> Henley </LOCATION>. The move, which would boost <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s stake in Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> to 34.3 percent from 15.7 percent, was expected to receive a cool reaction from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, which has been fending off <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s unwanted overtures since mid-1987 <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrt </PERSON> said the proposal would be taken up at <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s regularly scheduled board meeting Tuesday. He added there might be a comment after that. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s proposal calls for <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> to stop the planned payment of $ 5 per share in high-yield `` junk bonds'' for each of its 157.3 million shares on March 1. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> already has made a $ 25-per-share cash payout. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> has claimed persistently that the pay-in-kind debentures would leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the way they are structured. Instead, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> proposed that <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> sell <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> $ 780 million worth of new stock at $ 17.50 per share. Proceeds from that deal would be used to make a onetime $ 5-per-share cash payout to all current shareholders. The proposed deal would mean 44.6 million new shares for <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> and would boost <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s total shares outstanding to 201.9 million. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> now owns 24.6 million shares, or 15.7 percent, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, a railroad, land and natural resources concern. But <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> conditioned its proposal on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> voiding its current `` poison pill'' takeover defense that would be triggered if any holder's stake exceeds 20 percent. If any hostile suitor exceeds that limit, other <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would be permitted to buy new stock at half price. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> repeatedly has criticized <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>'s adoption of the `` poison pill'' last December, saying it restricted the ability of major holders such as itself and Toronto-based real estate concern <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> to maneuver. In a setback for <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month gave two seats on its board to officials of <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In exchange, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> agreed to support <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring plans. However, in mid-February <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> launched a surprise tender offer to boost its holdings in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to 19.9 percent from its current 10.5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York's action has caused speculation that the Canadian company still intends to push for break-up of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> as a means of increasing the company's value.

<HEAD>Stock-Index Futures Hit Highest Level Since Oct. 19</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock-index futures overcame selling resistance Monday to settle at their highest values since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. On other markets, cotton futures collapsed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; livestock and meat were mixed; precious metals were mixed; and energy futures were lower. The contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index gained 3.90 points to settle at 266.85 on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, topping the previous post-collapse high of 264 points set Jan. 5. The March contract had rallied above the psychologicially important 264-point barrier earlier in the session only to fall back. But the second surge inspired broad-based follow-through buying that continued until the close, indicating the market had potential to move even higher, said <PERSON> Abbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocuzza </PERSON>, stock-index strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Cocuzza </PERSON> speculated the next point of resistance was 274 points, the level at which the March S & amp; P 500 contract opened on Oct. 19 after hitting a low of 280.40 in the previous session. Cotton futures prices collapsed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a sell-off linked to the impending expiration of the March contract. Tuesday marks the first notice day for the March cotton contract. Traders holding `` long,'' or buy, positions rushed to liquidate those positions to avoid the possibility of being locked into agreements to take physical delivery of cotton on the contract's March 9 expiration date, analysts said. The sharp decline in the March contract's price touched off computerized sell programs that drove prices on the three near-term contracts down the daily limit and sent prices on other contracts to new life-of-contract lows, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, cotton specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The contract for March delivery of cotton settled at 60.40 cents a pound, down the 2-cent limit. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A mixed opening was followed by firmer prices across the board, but the gains did not hold as commission houses became heavy sellers of soybeans and soybean oil near the close, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The beans and oil were the two markets that really collapsed, and that collapse pulled everything else down,'' he said. Wheat settled -RCB- cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with March at $ 3.22 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 \ cents lower with March at $ 1.99 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $ 1.90 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents lower to 3 cents higher with March at $ Cattle futures declined while pork futures rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Profit-taking and hedge selling pressured the cattle contracts, and the pork complex rallied on better-than-expected cash prices, analysts said. Live cattle were .15 cent to .75 cent lower with April at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to 1.03 cents lower with March at 82.52 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent to .33 cent lower with April at 44.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.10 cents lower to .35 cent higher with February at 54.02 cents a pound. Gold retreated slightly while silver gained a bit in light trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled 20 cents to 80 cents lower with April at $ 447.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent higher across the board with March at $ 6.41 a troy ounce. Oil prices edged lower after fluctuating in a narrow range. Some analysts cited reports of overproduction and other problems within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that could point to bigger oil supplies. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 25 cent lower with March at $ 16.62 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent to .56 cent lower with March at 45.79 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .25 cent lower with March at 46.32 cents a gallon.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will introduce an amber colored soft drink labeled 7-Up Gold designed to reach young adults, company officials said Monday. The company is characterizing the new product as `` the wild side of 7-Up,'' a natural spice flavored soft drink sweetened with aspartame. `` 7-Up Gold is the missing link in the 7-Up family,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Albers </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the company, a subsidiary of the Dallas-based investment group <ORGANIZATION> Hicks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. Company officials said they are trying to reach a mostly male 18 - to 34-year-old market with the new drink The company also will introduce a Diet 7-Up Gold. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, senior vice president of marketing, said that while the image of 7-Up is clean-cut and conservative, 7-Up Gold is aimed at mainstream soft drink consumers who generally drink colas. But like all 7-Up products, it will be `` light, refreshing, thirst quenching, crisp, natural and translucent,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. Shipments of the new drink will begin in April, in time for the spring and summer seasons, with national distribution expected by the end of May, officials said. The company will spend more than $ 10 million in advertising for the drink this spring and summer, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. The new drink follows the introduction of Cherry 7-Up and Diet Cherry 7-Up last year. Those drinks have captured 1.7 percent of the lucrative soft drink market. <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> said 7-Up Gold now gives the company `` the most complete, competitive line-up'' in the soft drink industry.
