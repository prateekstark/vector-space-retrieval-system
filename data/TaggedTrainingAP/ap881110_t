 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been forced to suspend at least until January the processing of applications of Soviet refugees, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In a sense, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is a victim of its own policy. Having insisted that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> allow people to leave, the embassy now finds that the flood of about 100 applications a day is exceeding financial and quota limits. Most of the refugees are Armenians, although a few are Jews. In another category, the level of Jews allowed to leave for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is now so high there may be a slowdown in processing those who apply in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instead, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> called the Soviet response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emigration demands a `` welcome development.'' But, he said, it meant the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> processed six times as many refugees from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in fiscal year 1988, which ended Sept. 30, as in the previous year. A total of 16,500 Soviet refugees and immigrants are permitted to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year _ 4,000 directly as refugees and 12,500 via <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Among the refugees, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, there is a backlog of 1,700 cases, causing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials to halt further interviews at least until January. `` In view of the situation,'' the spokesman said, `` the embassy is urging applicants not to make an irrevocable commitment or to cut their ties'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. At present, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, 1,500 applicants have been cleared and will leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> once they obtain airline tickets. The second category of immigrants facing a squeeze are Jews who go to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> with permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and then ask for admission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There were 2,400 applications in October, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, `` and at this rate it may result in delays of processing, as well.'' While most of the immigrants who exit through <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> are Jews, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, a small percentage are not. But all of them have exit permits as Jews for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. This year's quota is squeezed by a need to process some 1,500 who were stranded last summer in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> by an upsurge in Soviet permits. Last year, 20,421 immigrants reached the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, about 9,400 of them Jews.

<HEAD>Group Asks Banks To Prod Latin America To Forgo Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An anti-nuclear group on Thursday urged three major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks with large loans to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to use their influence to dissuade those two nations from developing nuclear weapons. `` In no area of the world is the issue of nuclear proliferation more uncertain than in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Stone, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 5,000 scientists seeking to end the nuclear arms race. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said he made the plea in the form of a shareholders' resolution that federation members who hold bank stock had submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> He said those banks have loans totalling $ 10 billion to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The resolution urged each bank `` to commend the two countries for their declared policy of using nuclear power only for peaceful purposes'' and `` to convey to suitable Brazilian and Argentine officials its view that nuclear explosives, and a nuclear arms race, in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would complicate the bank's ability to sustain its financial links to that region.'' Neither <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is believed to have nuclear weapons. But both are developing nuclear plants that when fully operational could produce nuclear weapons material, according to a statement released by the federation. Both nations have recently gone from military to civilian rule, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1983 and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1985, a transition which in the view of nuclear proliferation expert <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> has decreased their inclination to develop nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, wrote in his 1987 book, `` Going Nuclear,'' that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are the only nations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` with programs that might lead to the development of a nuclear deterrent.'' `` Since the summer of 1987, the leaders of each country have visited classified nuclear installations of the other, developments which in this field are unprecedented confidence-building steps,'' <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said in an interview. But the political climate could change, said <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, and the nuclear programs in the two countries `` are reaching a point where dangerous ambiguities are going to arise, creating suspicions in both countries that the other is moving to acquire nuclear weapons.'' `` What we need to do is encourage positive political steps to slow down the technological trends,'' he said. Argentinta and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> have refused to sign binding non-proliferation pledges under the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which has been ratified by over 130 governments. A spokesman for Manufacturers' Hanover Trust, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, said bank had loans of $ 1.4 billion to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and $ 2 billion to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. He said the bank had received the resolution and would respond, but had no immediate public comment. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> could not immediately be reached for comment.

 A collection of photographs by 19th century children's writer and mathematician <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, most of them of a female child model, has fetched $ 55,780 at auction, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> auctioneers said. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, whose real name was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutwidge </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodgson </PERSON>, was an enthusiastic photographer who wrote the classic children's stories `` <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'s Adventures in Wonderland'' and `` Through the Looking Glass.'' Most of the 61 prints and 27 negatives sold Wednesday are of a family friend, child model <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON>, between the ages of five and 16. She was known as `` Xie'' by her family, and her godmother was Queen <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>. One of the bidders was <PERSON> Xie </PERSON>'s great-granddaughter, <PERSON> Deryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowdy </PERSON>, a 26-year-old artist who paid $ 268 for a photograph of <PERSON> Xie </PERSON> at the age of 12 in July 1876. The collection, which had been expected to sell for about $ 80,000, came on the market after a family disagreement over ownership, said Miss Cowdyy. `` There was a huge family row about who they belonged to, so they finally went to the family's solicitors -LRB- lawyers -RRB-,'' she said. `` Because they could n't agree, it was decided to sell them and divide the money between <PERSON> Xie </PERSON>'s 16 grandchildren. It's a bit sad, really.'' The Musee D'Orsay in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> bought several photographs to add to its existing collection of <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s photographs.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Claussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday a recall of certain jars of sauerkraut because pieces of glass were found in eight containers in three states, officials said. Woodstock-based <PERSON> Claussen </PERSON> asked consumers to return all 32-ounce jars of sauerkraut labled `` Use by Feb. 18, 89'' and `` Use by Feb. 19, 89'' to the stores where they were purchased, said company spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Aehl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Claussen </PERSON> produced 63,000 jars bearing the two dates. Consumers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, found glass in three jars over the weekend, he said. There were no reports of injuries. `` We searched store supplies in those areas and discovered five other jars that had glass in the sauerkraut,'' <PERSON> Aehl </PERSON> said. `` That's when we decided to recall the product. The size of the glass fragments ranged from slivers to 1 -LCB- - inch-long pieces, he said Company officials were trying to determine how the glass got into the sauerkraut, he said, `` We believe it happened during ther manufacturing of the product. There's no evidence of tampering. It appears to be broken jars where a little glass got into the product.'' The company set up a toll-free telephone number for consumers to call if they have questions. The number is 1-800-322-1421 and people can call between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. EST.

<HEAD>Athens Police Clash With Striking Taxi Drivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riot squads fired tear gas to disperse more than 1,000 taxi drivers who blocked a central city square to protest anti-pollution measures that restrict their movement. Two taxi drivers were arrested during the clashes Wednesday outside parliament in Constitution square, a police official said. The cabbies blocked traffic with more than 500 taxis, and clashes broke out when police started towing the parked yellow cabs. The city's 17,000 cabbies began a four-day strike Tuesday to protest anti-pollution measures restricting taxi circulation on weekdays in a five-square-mile zone around the city center. The restrictions work according to odd and even license plate numbers. The cabbies claim 50 percent of their fares are generated in the city center. The average taxi driver takes home about $ 400 a month. A brown colored smog, known to Athenians as the Nefos _ or cloud _ forms over the city on warm, windless days. Cars, diesel-powered taxis and the city's aging buses are blamed for most of the pollution.

 Hand-in-hand, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife walked down the little path that leads from the Oval Office to the south drive to greet the next occupants of the White House. `` We'll sign over the lease later,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters The long black limousine bringing Vice President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from Andrews Air Force Base stopped at the foot of the walk and the first one out was Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the vice president-elect, who had been riding in the jump seat. Often in American history, when outgoing and incoming president meet at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the atmosphere is strained and the words stilted. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had gone all out to get his vice president elected and on Wednesday, when they gathered for the first time since the election, all was cheer. `` There he is,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he spotted the president. `` Thank you so much.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and their wives, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> shook hands all around and walked into the Oval Office for less than five minutes of transition talk. `` Do you like the looks of the place?'' shouted a reporter. `` Beautiful day,'' said the vice president-elect. `` Look good to you?'' `` Beautiful day.'' Later, speaking to a few hundred supporters in the Rose Garden, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe there's a case in modern presidential politics of a president who's worked so hard to help someone else achieve this office and I will always be grateful.'' And <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: `` If anyone wants to know how <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I feel about this moment, just read our smiles.'' He then mentioned that he figures it's only 1,188 days until the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus. In the mellowness of the moment, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the Democrats who ran against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I want to congratulate both of you, as well as Governor -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Senator -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in taking on the great challenge, and your sense of public duty in seeing it through to the end.'' `` Each of you is better for it, and so is the country,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. As for the new administration: `` You ai n't seen nothing yet.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the last to take the microphone. `` Thank you for all you have done for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. And to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` Yesterday, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people overwhelmingly placed their trust and their confidence in your leadership, and I'm delighted to be part of that team and ready to go to work and change <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and make it even greater.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was back tending to <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> duties a day after losing his bid for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, promising to be <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' `` very best governor'' and warning that the negative tone of this year's campaign set a dangerous precedent for coming races. `` I gave it my best shot,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday after spending several hours catching up on state business. `` Almost does n't count in politics.'' He said he felt no bitterness toward <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and was ready to put the campaign behind him and complete the final two years of his term as governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave no indication whether he will run for a fourth term in 1990 or seek the presidency again in four years. `` At this point my job is clear: I'm going to be the very best governor of this commonwealth that I can be,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters. `` There's a lot to do. There are many challenges out there ahead. What happens in the future remains to be seen.'' Among those challenges will be re-establishing relations with his state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> amid growing rumbling about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration's handling of a revenue shortfall that has forced <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to borrow to pay its bills. Although it is dominated by Democrats, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled hearings next week to look into state finances, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could come under fire from lawmakers unhappy that the governor was out of state for much of the past year as the problem unfolded. At the same time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he expected to remain a player in national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> politics _ including having a say in the selection of a new party chairman. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wasted no time getting back to work, arriving at the office at 9:30 a.m. to applause from about 50 state workers. Later in the day he met with reporters to reflect on the campaign, which he said left President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> without a mandate and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with lasting grass-roots and fund-raising organizations despite his loss. `` I'm not a bitter person,'' a weary <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I look forward. I'm fundamentally an optimist and somebody who believes deeply in this country and its people. `` Am I disappointed, sure I am,'' he said, laying at least part of the blame for his loss on the tone of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` It was a distorted campaign,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` It was a campaign that distorted my record and I think did not set high standards for the kind of campaign we want for the presidency and it may well set a standard we live to regret.'' National Democratic leaders were unhappy with the insular management of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> effort, yet <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trumpeted himself as someone who would keep a high profile within his party. `` I'll be in the thick of the fight to make sure that we respond to the real concerns of the people of this coutnry,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I personally will continue to do whatever I can, with my fellow governors, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, with the new administration, here in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, to make sure that we respond and that we respond strongly and well to those concerns and those challenges which face the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people every day.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also had a bit of advice for future candidates. `` I think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have to respond and you have to respond quickly,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who largely ignored unrelenting <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attacks _ and advisers urging him to respond _ until late in the campaign. But he had no substantive answer to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s dilemma; while it has great success in local, state and congressional races it has had only one successful presidential candidate in the last 20 years <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also offered a few jokes before saying good-bye to the large national press corps that traveled with him. `` I believe in the redemption of souls,'' he deadpanned when asked about the appointment of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who managed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> so frequently criticized, as secretary of state. He drew laughter again when asked why he did n't campaign throughout the race as furiously as he did in the final three days, when he stumped virtually non-stop without sleep. `` If I had more time, you'd all be in the hospital,'' he said with a grin. `` I would n't have done that to you guys, I think too much of you.''

<TEXT>
 If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants advice from former presidents, he is likely to have more of them to call upon than any president since <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. For the first time since <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> died on July 24, 1862, there are expected to be four living ex-presidents after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. This, of course, assumes that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the three former presidents now living - <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> - survive to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sworn in. All of them are believed to be in good health. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the oldest, at 77. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> are 75 and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 64. There have only been four times in American history when as many as four former presidents were living - during the administrations of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. Actually, when <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> moved into the White House in March of 1861, there were five of his predecessors still around. In addition to <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, whom he succeeded, they were <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> died in January 1862, and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> died six months later. Five times in history there have been no former presidents alive, most recently for the last year and a half of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, after <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> died in January 1973. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> of course could not call on one of his predecessors for advice, because he did n't have any. As for his successor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> died in December 1979, midway through the <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and his three successors, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, all survived into the administration of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> The elder <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was the longest lived of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, dying at 91. The younger <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> all lived into the <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> administration of the 1840s. <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> died at 53, shortly after leaving office, but <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> all lived into and through <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>'s term as president Fillmore and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, were living when <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> took office in 1869, but all had died by the time <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> left the White House in 1877. The next time the nation was left without a living ex-president was during the last two months of the <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> administration, following the death of <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> in January 1933. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> was the only living president throughout the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tenure of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> named <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> to head commissions to reorganize the executive branch of government. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has met privately with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> several times during his administration.

 Vice president-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is getting ready to settle into his new job in January, while his wife apparently is mulling what to do if offered her husband's vacant <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. As Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., headed toward his transition headquarters near the White House Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked by reporters if she was interested in succeeding her husband `` You'll have to ask the governor,'' she replied. `` That's an answer I'll give him. You'll be the second to know.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has refused to say when he would officially notify <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> of his resignation from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He has signaled several times in recent days that he would submit his resignation before <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s term ends in January so that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor, rather than Democratic Gov.-elect <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, can appoint someone to fill the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said he had no specific timetable for making staff appointments and said his tour of the four-story, white-brick townhouse off <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> was aimed at `` assembling thoughts, conversing with people, nothing specific.'' `` When we have specific things, believe me, you'll be the first to know,'' the senator said, a day after he and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored a lopsided electoral triumph over Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had no public events on his schedule today, and aides said he would continue to make telephone calls and contacts as he works on the transition. There has been widespread speculation that <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a licensed lawyer in addition to being a housewife, is among those under consideration to take her husband's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. Among other names mentioned in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Republican political circles are Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON>, and possibly Lt. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> on Tuesday. The Quayles have sought to minimize speculation that Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is interested in succeeding her husband. The couple have three children _ <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 14, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, 12 and <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, 9 _ and it is believed that one obstacle to Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s taking on a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat is their concern about both parents being involved in extremely demanding jobs On Wednesday afternoon, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> rode out to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to greet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the vice president's return from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying `` he's going to be one of the great vice presidents. You watch him closely.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife drove to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where they exchanged tributes with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` As one who came to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, thank you for all you have done for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` ... The American people overwhelmingly placed their trust and their confidence in your leadership, and I'm delighted to be a part of that team and am ready to go to work and change <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and make it even greater.''

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, vowing to revitalize government with `` a brand new team of people,'' has instructed key figures from his campaign to develop priorities for the crucial first 100 days of his coming administration. Even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the presidency, job applications were pouring into his standby transition office. The stream of resumes is expected to turn into a flood now at newly opened <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition headquarters. Just hours after claiming victory, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the first steps Wednesday toward assembling his presidency. The president-elect, at a news conference in his adopted home of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> before flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, named <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his campaign chairman and longtime trusted adviser, to be secretary of state. It could be the most important post in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency, given the vice president's emphasis on foreign affairs and his interest in pursuing progress with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, while preparing for his diplomatic duties, also will play a major role in the transfer of power to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential chief of staff, and campaign pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> will share authority as co-chairmen of the transition team. Mindful that the first months of an administration set the tone for relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and foreign governments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I will have a game plan.'' `` Part of what the transition is about is to spell out the priorities. I spelled them out -LRB- during the campaign -RRB- in broad terms, in terms of keeping the economic expansion going and in terms of world peace. But the election ended yesterday,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We will now have -LRB- 73 -RRB- days ... to formulate a game plan, the first 100 day priorities, if you will, and they'll be specific.'' In an announcement sure to send shivers through the ranks of the 5,000 political appointees happily at work in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I will for the most part bring in a brand new team of people from across the country.'' `` And in my view that will reinvigorate the process,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He deliberately left room for some <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holdovers and veterans to join his administration. `` There will be ... a major turnover but some people at various levels may be asked to remain.'' On the flight back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to announce the rest of his Cabinet `` sooner rather than way late'' and would think about the possible choices during a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation this weekend. It has been widely assumed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will ask Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> to stay on. All three joined the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in recent months. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Wednesday he had been given no indication of whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted him to remain `` nor have I sought'' any information on the question. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to replace <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> with former <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief and deputy attorney general <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON> or Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Wednesday he was n't interested Former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, an arms negotiator in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration who later advised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign on national security matters, may be in line for secretary of Defense. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Dore </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> may keep her post as <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> secretary or get another Cabinet position, possibly <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, where she was undersecretary from 1984 to 1987. Others mentioned as possible nominees for the Labor post include Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, now director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> Former Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, wife of one-time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, also is mentioned as a candidate for another Cabinet job. For the powerful post of budget chief, the odds on favorite is <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, a one-time senior aide in the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and later deputy secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s name also has been mentioned as the new White House chief of staff, although <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> are more frequently discussed for that job. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> also is a candidate to be secretary of Energy. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, is known to be interested in the job of national security adviser at the White House. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who served in that role for President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, is mentioned for it again. Over the next 2 -LCB- months, power will begin to shift from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments look to the incoming president for a signal of his intentions. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is still the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I will not be using the transition to try to make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the president's.'' Policy matters aside, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated his management style will be different from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. For example, he said he will be briefed directly every day by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> on intelligence matters instead of relying on the White House national security adviser for an update, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also announced that <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, his legal adviser in the vice president's office, will serve the same role in the transition and then go on to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> as his general counsel. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> who has been a one-man transition planner for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will be the transition's chief personnel headhunter and keep the same job in the White House come Jan. 20 <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, who has been the campaign secretary, will be press secretary during the transition. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention whether she would have that title in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and some <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> sources close to the campaign indicate someone else may get the job. Altogether, there are 5,000 political appointments, divided between presidential appointments and those made by <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretaries and agency heads. Many of the 3,000 or so presidential appointments do not really draw the attention of the chief executive and are handled by others. `` It's in the hundreds rather than the thousands that really matter,'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Malfunctions Delay Occupancy Of $23 Million CDC Containment Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Malfunctions in a ventilation system designed to contain deadly microbes will delay occupancy of a $ 23 million research building at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> until at least next year, officials said Wednesday. The new maximum-containment laboratory, for which a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held last month, is part of <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s shift from investigating outbreaks of disease to basic research into infectious disease. An estimated 80 researchers had planned to move into the building this fall, but the move will be delayed until problems are worked out in the complex ventilation system. `` They want to be sure before they clear a system like that for people like me to crawl under a hood and begin working with a hot virus,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowlkes </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s retrovirus laboratory. The system is designed to keep air pressure inside the building's 12 laboratories slightly below normal atmospheric pressure so that air from the hallways always flows into the labs The intentional draft is supposed to keep microbes such as viruses from being carried out of the labs. Viruses that will be studied at the labs include those that cause AIDS and Lassa Fever, which has caused epidemics of hemorrhagic fever in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> engineer responsible for operating the air system, said Wednesday that the problems lie somewhere in the 96 pneumatic control units whose delicate sensors and valves measure and adjust air pressure throughout the building. For unknown reasons, changes in air pressure, such as those caused by an open door, throw the gauges out of adjustment. The building originally was scheduled for completion in late 1987.

 The latest showing of the <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> movie classic `` Casablanca'' is not in black and white, and the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is red all over. The Hollywood industry group said Wednesday night's showing of a color-enhanced version of `` Casablanca'' on cable television's SuperStation <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> represented `` a new low point in the battle to degrade an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art form. The 1941 classic, which also starred <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, was filmed in black and white. `` In total disregard for the place ` Casablanca' holds in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cultural heritage, <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> has gone ahead with a computerized assault on one of history's greatest and most-beloved motion pictures,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumpel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, said in a statement. `` For those who choose to watch the broadcast, we would simply remind them that what they are seeing is not ` Casablanca,' but a computerized parody of an original and classic work,'' he said. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>' owner, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who also owns <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>'s film library, has experienced similar criticism but healthy ratings for its colorized versions of old movie classics.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, assured of improving their majority control by at least one seat, are signaling President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that they want to avoid partisan warfare with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes in January. The final margin of the Democratic grip on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from Tuesday's elections will not be clear until a cliffhanger race in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is resolved. The margin of victory for either Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> or Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> will not be known until state election officials complete the formidable task of counting the estimated 100,000 absentee ballots, the last to be tallied of the four million votes cast. The vote counting was not expected to be complete until sometime today at the earliest. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> held a slim lead before the absentee ballots were put on the counting tables, but after the first results became known, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> had erased MacKay's advantage and had built a small lead of his own. A victory by <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> would leave Democrats with 55 of the 100 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, up one from the 54-46 majority they held during the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A MacKay victory would hand the Democrats a 56-44 edge. In Tuesday's balloting in 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races, Republicans lost seats in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; Democratic seats were captured by Republican candidates in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Even if Democrats were to lose in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, they still would have the majority. That carries with it the chairmanship of all <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees and the right to set the chamber's agenda. Some lawmakers indicated that does not necessarily mean trouble ahead for Republican President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he and other chairmen `` are prepared to work with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and do that straight up, no holds barred, and find whether he means what he says when he says that he expects to have a close relationship with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the House. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said late Tuesday night that he believes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will find a cooperative spirit on Capitol Hill because `` the problems are too important for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to work with the president. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, predicted budget issues will dominate the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next year. The new president's oft-repeated opposition to higher taxes `` will be the big sticking point'' in his dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> added While most of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races were won by decisive margins, one was so close that the outcome may be challenged. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, Republican Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> won a third term by a razor-thin edge over <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> with unofficial returns giving the incumbent a 1,310-vote edge over the Democrat. But the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commmittee </ORGANIZATION> charged irregularities in the handling of absentee ballots. Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON> said that after reviewing the campaign committee's allegations with 23 county clerk's offices, she had no reason to call for a recount in the contest. <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON> said state law requires a recount if the difference between the two candidates' votes is less than 1 percent of those cast for the winner. In the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, the difference would have to have been less than 911 votes. However, a candidate may request a recount if he agrees to pay for it. Recounting the votes would cost a maximum of $ 11,500, <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>, a state senator, said Wednesday his campaign was still considering whether to ask for a recount. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, liberal Republican Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, who served 18 years, conceded Wednesday night after losing by just over 10,000 votes to Democrat <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, the state attorney general. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, in a news conference in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, shouldered the responsibility for his defeat and ruled out any future in politics. `` I'm a big guy. I take care of myself. I take shots, I've given shots,'' he said. `` I'm responsible for last night's results. `` I did n't lose this race by a few thousand votes,'' the former senator said. `` In my mind and in my heart, I lost it by 100,000. ... This was n't a close race. It was a clear mandate by the state of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, that matters that I stood for are not to their liking, and that matters that Mr. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> stood for are to their liking.'' While 10 new senators were elected Tuesday, there will be 11 new faces when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convenes in January. Republican vice president-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has indicated that he would step down before January so <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s GOP Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> _ not the incoming governor, Democrat <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> _ can appoint a successor.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief is leaving government next month, after a seven-year tenure marked by support from conservatives and condemnation from civil rights groups for his attacks on affirmative action. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division, said Wednesday he is resigning effective Dec. 9. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said he probably will remain in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area to practice law and is discussing job possibilities with private firms. In an interview, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said he felt the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's greatest achievement in the civil rights field has been `` restoring the principle of non-discrimination to its rightful pedestal.'' He said his greatest disappointment was getting word of `` our extraordinary record out to the public in the way I would have wanted.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> spearheaded the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's opposition to affirmative action hiring and promotion programs and other anti-discrimination tools that had been at the heart of federal civil rights policies since the 1960s. Liberals expressed pleasure over his resignation while conservatives praised his record. `` If <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' departure is an indication of what the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will look like, then this is a hopeful sign indeed,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, a civil liberties organization with 270,000 members. `` Reynolds ... will be missed by civil rights advocates about as much as environmentalists miss -LRB- former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman under former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and now a resident scholar of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> `` a man dedicated to colorblind law.'' `` He deserves great credit for making often courageous attempts to advance that cause,'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said. `` In areas ranging from forced school busing to employment discrimination to voting rights, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has had a greater impact upon the law in this area than anyone since <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> Meese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who is now with the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank.

 An investigation board determined that inadequate procedures and poor design were mainly to blame for a flash fire that did minor damage to the Magellan Venus space probe. The fire occurred Oct. 17 in a checkout hangar here when a technician inadvertently hooked up an electrical connector with the wrong jack, creating a short circuit that triggered a two - to three-inch flame from a test battery on the spacecraft The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimated the small blaze did $ 87,000 damage to the battery, electrical wiring and an insulation blanket. Officials said the accident would have no impact of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s April launch toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> from the space shuttle Atlantis. In its final report released Wednesday, the board did not blame the technician, saying he had to work `` in the blind'' in a confined area while making the connection because of the spacecraft's design. The board recommended that procedures for hooking up the battery connector be revised to permit easier access and greater visibility, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busse </PERSON>, who headed the investigation. The board also said that before the accident it was believed the connector could not cause a short if it made contact with the wrong jack, but subsequent testing showed electrical contact can be made on at least 10 of the 37 pins in the connector. It recommended that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> issue an alert of this possibility. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, which made the spacecraft, said in a statement that it is making design and procedural changes recommended by the board.

<HEAD>GAO: Nuclear Regulatory Problems Raise Public's Exposure Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has `` continuing and sometimes chronic problems'' with its procedures for licensing people to handle radioactive materials, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said in a report. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> usually does not verify license application information, visit the nuclear facility before granting a license or have specific criteria for determining when to reject a license application. It said that as a result, `` <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is overly vulnerable to dishonest or careless applicants.'' `` All of these weaknesses or problems increase the public's risk of exposure,'' said the report issued Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, had asked for the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation after a September 1986 accidental spill of radioactive material that had been smuggled onto Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON> issued a statement calling on the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to `` take immediate action to correct deficiencies identified in the report.'' `` We have every right to expect quick response from an agency that oversees hazardous materials licensing. Unfortunately, there is little in the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report to suggest that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has corrected critical problems identified over the last 16 years,'' <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopack </PERSON> said the agency would not discuss the report until after the agency's staff had reviewed it. The report noted that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has limited resources: 25 full-time license reviewers and 36 inspectors, versus 7,700 licenses for industrial and other uses of radioactive materials. In addition to granting licenses without verifying applicants' claims or visiting facilities, the report said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>: _ Does n't have checklists to determine when a license application should be denied or when repeat violators should get extra _ Does n't make sure licence-holders can afford to clean up after an accident _ Takes too long to renew licenses and make inspections because of large backlogs In the case that led to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> inquiry, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> gave a radioactive materials-handling license to a 10th-grade dropout without checking his claims about training and experience. The agency learned <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, had provided false information on his application only after it issued the license, which enabled <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> to use radioactive material to change the color of diamonds. `` Despite this finding <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> was not only allowed to keep the license but it was amended to permit him to use larger quantities of americium in any form,'' the report said. Americium, a hazardous byproduct of nuclear reactors, turns diamonds green and makes lesser-quality stones more saleable. Its radiation is 1,000 times more potent than a typical hospital diagnostic procedure. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> illegally disposed of some of his radioactive waste at a high-security munitions area of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Two accidental discharges there in 1986 forced the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to tear down a storage building and invest $ 1 million to decontaminate the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s Superfund paid out $ 385,000 to clean up <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' contaminated home. In another case reviewed in the report, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> conducted no inspections between 1979 and 1986 at <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which was licensed to conduct research on a number of radioactive materials. The 1986 inspection discovered coffee cups and food in the laboratories, too close to radiation sources _ a problem the university had agreed to correct in 1975. Last year, the university was fined $ 10,000 and its license was suspended after the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> identified 21 license violations, including the storage of food in restricted areas.

<HEAD>Fifty Years After Pogrom, East Berlin Jewish Landmarks Still In
Ruins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As Germans commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nazi pogrom called Kristallnacht, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest Jewish cemeteries is in ruins and one of its most magnificent synagogues remains a bombed-out hulk. Both sites are in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and have been focal points of observances of the Nov. 9-10, 1938, attacks by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> thugs on Jews, their businesses and synagogues that launched the Holocaust. In the 108-year-old Jewish cemetery, the graves of once-prominent <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> intellectuals, artists, scientists and businessmen are overgrown by trees and shrubs. Visitors must weave through dense underbrush to view gravestones toppling after decades of neglect. The once-ornate synagogue, built in 1866, escaped destruction during Kristallnacht, which means ` Night of Broken Glass' in German. Witnesses say a police officer prevented Nazi brownshirts from starting enough fires to destroy the building, then called a fire brigade that put out the blaze. But the synagogue was heavily damaged during Allied bombing raids in 1943, and only its colored, oriental brick facade and turret remain. Both landmarks are remants of the city's rich Jewish history, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s communist authorities say they intend to aid efforts by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s tiny Jewish community to restore the cemetery in the city's once-affluent Weissensee section. An international trust has been set up with the consent of the government to help finance restoration of the synagogue, a task Jewish community spokeswoman <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Runge </PERSON> says will take at least five years. Before the Holocaust, 170,000 Jews lived in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> alone. Now, an estimated 450-600 practicing Jews live in all of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, about half of them in the communist half of the divided city. They have no permament rabbi. So far, much of the restoration work on the cemetery has been done by the small and financially strapped Jewish community, with the help of student and church groups. `` There just are n't enough resources to repair it and to keep it up,'' said one cemetery worker. Among the 115,000 Jews buried there are some of the most influential people in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> society until the beginning of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> rule in 1933. A special section contains the remains of 365 Jews who died fighting for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I. Another section, erected after <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s defeat in 1945, contains the graves of scores who died in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps. Historical accounts say Jews often thronged to the cemetery to walk for a few undisturbed hours after <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> laws banned them from many areas of the city. The cemetery was closed in 1943, and afterwards its grounds were used on occasion by Jews in hiding, historical records indicate. During this week's events marking the anniversary of Kristallnacht, the East German government has emphasized the role of the communists in fighting fascism and anti-Semitism. But it has reiterated its longstanding rejection of any responsibility for the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of 6 million Jews, because <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was founded after the war. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, also created from the ruins of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, has paid more than 80 billion marks -LRB- $ 45 billion at today's rates -RRB- to Holocaust victims and their families. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has not paid any reparations. Many members of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Jewish community are skeptical about the motives behind communist authorities' newly expressed willingness to help them. `` What good does this all do me if I still have to ask a German in uniform for permission to visit my sick brother in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' said one elderly Jewish resident. The East German government in 1961 erected a wall that divides the city into communist and Western-controlled sectors.

<TEXT>
 A productive summit meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a resumption of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have high priority with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he prepares to move into the White House. At a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> news conference Wednesday in which he named <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as his choice for secretary of state, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> provided more of an insight into his foreign policy views than he had throughout the election campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ruled out a meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> just to get to know the Soviet leader. `` I am acquainted with him,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` What I want to see is progress. I've never supported meetings just for the sake of having meetings.'' But he defined progress in a way that was far short of a demand that a summit produce cosmic results. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there were a number of areas _ arms control, human rights, regional disputes _ in which the superpowers could make headway. By offering a range of categories, the president-elect took a positive but cautious stance on summitry with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He said, for instance, that a summit would not have to produce a treaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on the other hand, entered the White House in January 1981 extremely reluctant to hold a summit. But after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over in 1985 the two leaders met annually _ four times, in all. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that before he would meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> he would have <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> confer with the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and then with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` But I do n't think that will start before I become president,'' he said. Asked about the Contras, whose surreptitious receipt of millions of dollars from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rocked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explicitly supported a resumption of aid. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off all military assistance last February. Humanitarian aid, in the form of food, clothing and shelter, is due to expire in March. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said aid to the rebels, who are at war with the government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, `` will have a high priority because freedom and democracy in this hemisphere have a high priority.'' He said he intended `` to keep the pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.'' In a third area, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believed the Soviets would adhere to their commitment to complete the withdrawal of their military forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. If the Soviets do not pull out, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` that will throw a complicating factor over the whole relationship.'' In responding to reporters' questions, the president-elect neither condemned the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on any issue nor lobbed any tough rhetoric at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. His overall tone on foreign policy was measured. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, meanwhile, hailed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s selection as a `` welcome and heartening event. In a news conference here, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had telephoned him before announcing the selection. `` He will hit the ground running,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleague and partner at international economic summit meetings. `` His close, warm and productive relationship with president-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes him just the guy to serve as the president's chief foreign policy adviser, and as chief spokesman for the president and for our nation's interests,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> both are considered moderate to conservative in their political views and are internationally minded. Together, they tried without much success to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit.

<HEAD>Forecast For 1988 Corn Harvest Revised Slightly Upward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This year's drought-reduced corn harvest is expected to total 4.67 billion bushels, 3 percent above last month's forecast but down 34 percent from the actual 1987 harvest, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> It represented the smallest harvest since 1983, when similar searing heat and lack of rain shriveled output to 4.17 billion bushels. The record was 8.88 billion bushels in 1985. The assessment Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, based on Nov. 1 estimates, came as farmers were trying to get the last of this year's corn harvest out of the fields. By the start of the month, farmers had harvested an estimated 83 percent of this fall's corn acreage, 7 percent behind last year but still 16 percent ahead of the 1983-87 average, the report said. The report reflected the summer drought in forecasting an average corn yield per acre of 83.2 bushels, down 37.1 bushels from last year but 2.1 bushels above the level contained in last month's forecast Farmers cut back this year to a little over 56.7 million acres for corn from 59.1 million in 1987. One reason was government programs designed to take acreage out of production and thus prevent surpluses that drive down crop prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is forecasting an adequate supply of corn next year despite the drought, largely because of an abundant existing stockpile. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say the drought is likely to add 1 percent to the consumer price index for food this year and 2 percent next year as the impact of the reduced crop is passed through to the market. The report said the `` all crops'' index of production as of Nov. 1 averaged 87 percent of the base year of 1977, down dramatically from 106 percent at the same time last year and the lowest level in 10 years. The record high for the index was 117 percent in 1981, 1982 and 1985. It dropped to 88 percent in 1983, when drought and government acreage cutbacks lowered production. It rose to 111 the following year. The report forecast soybean production at 1.51 billion bushels, up 1 percent from last month's forecast but 21 percent below last year's harvest of 1.92 billion bushels. The record was 2.26 billion bushels in 1979. The cotton harvest was estimated at 14.8 million bales, 1 percent above both the 1987 crop and the Oct. 1 forecast. The record was 18.95 million bales in 1937. With the harvest of 1988 crops winding down, no new production figures were included for many earlier commodities, such as wheat, oats and barley. Other crops in the November production report included: _ Sorghum, 546.3 million bushels and 60.6 bushels per acre compared to 740.8 million and 69.9 bushels per acre last year _ Rice, 158.4 million hundredweight and 5,547 pounds per acre compared to 127.7 million and 5,482 pounds last year _ Peanuts, 4.12 billion pounds and 2,507 pounds per acre compared to 3.62 billion pounds and 2,341 pounds per acre last year _ Tobacco, 1.33 billion pounds and 2,114 pounds per acre compared to 1.19 billion pounds and 2,028 pounds per acre last year

 Soviet corn imports are expected to increase by 3 million tons this year because of limited supplies of feed wheat on the world market and high barley prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The department said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> again is expected to be a major supplier followed by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Overall, Soviet net grain imports should be up 2 million tons, the department said. That estimate reflected not only an increase in purchases of coarse grains but a drop in expected Soviet wheat imports. A reduced coarse grain crop in 1988 and fairly attractive world prices have resulted in heavy Soviet corn purchases in the current marketing year. The department said coarse grain purchases to date total around 8 million tons with the bulk of the sales calling for delivery before the end of December. In part because the Soviets are pushing hard to increase livestock production, the department has increased its estimate of Soviet coarse grain imports in the marketing year that started in July to 17 million tons. The estimate for wheat imports was set at 13 million tons.

<HEAD>Official Says Restart Of Savannah Nuclear Reactor May Be Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Safety concerns at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear plant may postpone the scheduled December restart of a reactor and further delay fresh supplies of critical nuclear weapons materials, says a senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. `` My own view is that we have been making insufficient progress at the site to meet such a -LRB- December -RRB- date,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, acting assistant energy secretary for environment, safety and health. He also said needed improvement in equipment and operating procedures throughout the nuclear weapons production complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, would take years to implement. In the past few months, nuclear weapons production has ground to a virtual halt following shutdown of the three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the closure of a building at the Rocky Flats Plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and a strike which has shut down the Feed Materials Production Center in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors are the only facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now capable of producing plutonium and tritium, which are needed to make nuclear weapons. Plutonium supplies are plentiful, but the tritium shortage will cause problems sometime in the next six to 24 months, according to congressional and administration sources. <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> compared the state of the federal nuclear weapons complex to that of the commerical nuclear power industry after the accident at the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant near <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on March 28, 1979. He said it would take years to install safer equipment and raise training standards to levels commensurate with those found in private industry. `` These are programs that will take years to develop,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said in an inteview Tuesday. He envisioned widescale introduction of robotics and remote handling devices to protect the health of workers, but was unable to estimate the cost of such systemwide improvements. To outline restart plans and get a firmer grip on a timetable for <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said, he was meeting this week with managers from the department's office in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> and from E.I. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the current contract operator, and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is to take over the plant next April 1. `` I am not focusing on the date,'' said <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>. `` My goal this week is to get the people at the contract level, the <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> people, the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> people, along with <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> managers, to review the status of the detailed technical acceptance criteria we are going to be expecting those reactors to meet. `` The date will come out as a natural part of the dialogue,'' he said. Last month, Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said he hoped to begin a phased start-up of the plant's L-reactor in December, reaching 50 percent capacity over about a month. Each of the plant's three reactors, which began began operation in 1954, is restricted to 50 percent of full power due to safety concerns `` We will provide the secretary with an estimate of what it takes and when ... by the end of the month,'' said <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Apter </PERSON>, said `` the last date I heard was Dec. 31,'' and that was subject to delay. <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would develop what he called `` compensatory'' operating procedures to allow safe operation of the facilities. For <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, those steps include: _ Requiring reactor operators to practice accident control techniques extensively on a simulator; _ Requiring the presence of a degree-holding engineer in the control room; _ Adding more highly trained managers and operators to the staffs of the contractor and the regional department office; _ Reorganizing and improving communication between contractor and departmental employees, in particular assuring that those who manage and analyze the plant are in close contact with those in the control room; _ Developing detailed technical criteria on the operation of the plant, and making sure it is in the hands of the operators, a step which has not been taken before; _ Analyzing the ability of the reactors to withstand earthquakes

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran `` the worst campaign of this century,'' says one Democrat, but others blamed the party itself for losing touch with the people while some said nothing could overcome the Republican claim to peace and prosperity. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, the Democratic state chairman in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, gave no quarter to his party's fallen standard-bearer in his election post-mortem Wednesday. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign ran the worst campaign of this century,'' said <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>. `` Those guys up there in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> wrapped themselves in a cocoon and I do n't know what kind of folks they're used to talking to, but they did n't put a message out that was appealing to Texans.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Democrats must change the perception that they are weak on defense. `` This race was winnable,'' he went on. `` And we did n't win it. But that's more a fault of the campaign that we ran. ... <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will get a lot of blame, deserved or not deserved, but he will get it.'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairs, said, `` We're in this position where we can elect everybody but a president.'' `` We left <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> -LRB- site of the Democratic National Convention -RRB- thinking we could win,'' she said. `` Nobody thought it was going to be a lead-pipe cinch. ... It ended up not being close.'' Other prominent Democrats were more circumspect. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning'' that with the party's gains in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, `` you really should not be finger-pointing and blaming too much.'' `` We've done an awful lot of right things to be as strong as we are as a party,'' he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said, `` I think the campaign got away from -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- in August and September. ... He let the Republicans define him into something he really was n't and he never got back on track.'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> need `` to take a look at the whole card.'' `` There's obviously a disconnect between the primary system and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people insofar as Democrats are concerned,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the party whip in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, `` The Democratic party has to look West _ that's the area of opportunity for the Democrats. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said the party's nominee must `` cross the threshhold issues in the South'' with strong stands on national security, patriotism and crime `` We've got to broaden the base of the people who consider themselves to be Democrats,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said on the `` Today'' show. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a Republican analyst and publisher of the American Political Report, said: `` The Democratic problem was two-thirds <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. If he had been able to do in July and August ... what he did in late October with his spurt, I think they'd have been looking at a different situation.'' But other political analysts said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s margin _ 54 percent of the popular vote and 426 of the 538 electoral votes _ was so wide that defeat really can not be blamed on any <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> foibles. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't blow it. He could have run better obviously. ... The fundamentals of peace and prosperity were just too hard for Democrats to overcome.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a political analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` I do n't think they could have won. My guess in the end what defeated them was peace and prosperity. ... I do n't think <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would have won this election at the top of the Democratic ticket `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does not deserve all the blame he is going to get for this loss. People are going to blame <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a way of avoiding the harsh truth about where the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is today.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he vetoed a bill to coordinate federal policy and advice on nutrition because it would have created an `` unnecessary and complex federal bureaucracy.'' Backers of the bill said it was designed to make the government speak with one voice on nutrition instead of having several agencies an departments issue conflicting advice to the public. `` The administration strongly supports the principal goals of this legislation and reaffirms its commitment to use existing authority to achieve these ends,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement Wednesday. `` However, enactment of the bill would set up federal nutrition efforts on the wrong course. `` The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the bill's goals,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also vetoed a bill requiring specific questions in the 1990 census relating to plumbing facilities and heating and cooling equipment. He said the questions would not produce enough useful information to justify the increased cost and paperwork. The nutrition bill gave shared responsibility for the program to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and would also have created an administrator of nutrition monitoring, an interagency board and an advisory council. `` The creation of so much new federal bureaucracy would hinder, rather than aid, performance of federal nutrition-related functions,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The bill also would `` impose a substantial new burden on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer in future years to pay for federal government grants'' by requiring that a grant program be established as a result of the study, he said. `` Experience shows that once the federal government begins handing out money under a new grant program, a political constituency develops that demands greater funding for that program,'' the president said.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The Afghan rebels have the apparent endorsement of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in their latest drive against Soviet troops and government forces. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after reviewing the situation Wednesday with a top rebel leader: `` We see it eye to eye.'' There were no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> calls for restraint as <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> held back-to-back meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` we will continue to provide support for the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is providing support for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. And we would not intervene to direct their activities beyond that.'' About 50,000 Soviet troops remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They are due to leave by Feb. 15. But last Friday, citing rebel attacks, the Soviets announced a suspension. In the meantime, the Soviets brought in new missiles and fighter planes, and used the weapons against the rebels, who are armed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said `` we are ready to talk to the Russians directly, to know what their worries are about the withdrawal of their troops.'' But he said the guerrilla attacks would continue as long as the Soviets remained. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials urged both the rebels and the Soviets to show restraint. The aim was to maintain the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s exodus from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after nearly nine year of fighting. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, in his meetings here, evidently got a green light to keep up the pressure. Both <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> left that impression. Referring to the rebels, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` they are being attacked. The Soviets should not have troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the first place. So they should leave as they agreed to.'' <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> declared, meanwhile, that the guerrillas had decided to close the main road used by Soviet troops to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` It is true,'' he said. However, he left open whether the rebels would launch a military operation against the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> area. `` It would depend on the military situation,'' <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said. `` Our aim is peace. But if the Russians intensify the war, we have no choice.'' The road, much of which is tunneled, leads from the capital northward to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 A private health advocacy group is calling for an immediate halt to the use of silicone implants for breast enlargement even as the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has started a review of the issue that will take at least two years. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> released Wednesday, Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, also said the agency should issue an immediate alert telling the estimated 2 million women who have had such procedures they may run a heightened risk of health problems, including cancer. The agency has already scheduled a meeting of its plastic surgery devices advisory panel to review potential health problems that may be caused by silicone breast implants. It issued a background paper on the topic last week. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it has invoked a procedure whereby silicone gel implants will have to undergo the type of scientific review normally associated with new medical devices even though the implants were already on the market in 1976. That was the year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> authority over such products, which were given `` grandfather'' approval under the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it decided `` there are sufficient concerns about these products to call for premarket approval applications. This means that in order for the implants to remain on the market, manufacturers will have to supply <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> with scientific data demonstrating that they are safe and effective.'' The agency noted that the law sets a schedule giving the makers of such `` grandfathered'' products time to provide documentation for the safety of their products and said in the case of silicone implants, `` the deadline can be no sooner than December 1990.'' The advisory panel will be asked specifically to recommend what kind of scientific data manufacturers should be required to submit. While the full review is in progress, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it will see that the labeling information manufacturers are required to supply doctors `` explains adequately what is known about potential risks.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> document said the agency `` has been increasingly concerned about reports of adverse effects from breast implants, particularly in view of the large number of women who receive them.'' The agency said about 130,000 breast implants are done per year, most for cosmetic purposes. About 15 percent involve women having breast reconstruction after cancer surgery. `` There have been reports of fibrous tissue growth around implants, which can cause a painful hardening of the breast,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> document said. `` It is also possible that the implants could interfere with mammography pictures of the breast.'' Moreover, it said, `` small quantities of the gel have also been shown to migrate throughout the body, and this has raised questions about possible effects on the immune system and the fetus.'' The agency also referred to a study by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of silicone gel, that showed the gel can produce tumors in laboratory rats. `` Although it is unlikely that this finding is relevant to humans, the possibility of a cancer risk can not be completely ruled out,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> said in a statement that `` based on broad experience with implants for more than two decades,'' it has confidence in their safety. `` Patients who have had such surgery, or who are considering it, face no significant risk, based on all the data available to date,'' the company said. It added that <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> and other implant manufacturers `` have been working with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether any further studies are needed to document the safety of breast implants'' and that <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> has told the agency it `` is committed to conducting any such studies expeditiously.''

 Republican hopes that a strong presidential run by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would provide the impetus needed to pick off a few <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seem to have gone unfulfilled. With vote-counting complete for all but three races for the 435 House seats, there is little evidence that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory did very much _ if anything _ for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hopefuls. By late Wednesday, Democrats had boosted their overall majority in the chamber to 259 to 173, a pickup of two seats, and led in all three undecided contests. They padded the 77-39 edge they had held in the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 11 states of the old Confederacy by two seats, even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swept the South. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, boasted Wednesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had shown no coattails at all `` In fact, in his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where we picked up two <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats, he must have been wearing a tear-away jersey.'' Republicans conceded almost as much. `` Congressional races, particularly House races, are not national elections,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON>, R-Mich., who heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` They're essentially local races between two people who are fighting it out.'' In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hoped to knock off three Democratic incumbents. Not only did all three Democrats win, but one of them _ Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> _ won by 16 points, enlarging his 12-point victory of 1986. Some other potential coattail victims showed no ill effects from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> win. Always vulnerable Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa., enlarged his 10-point 1986 margin to 16 points this time Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, an 11-point winner in 1986, coasted to a 16-point edge Tuesday. Still others waivered but did not crumble. Freshman Rep. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, considered a possible loser, defeated <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> by four points, just one point less than her 1986 win. And Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., saw his 14-point 1986 victory shrink to 12 points this year The dust had yet to settle in three congressional districts where thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be counted in tabulations that may take days. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, held a 1,166-vote lead over Republican <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a political novice, in a district surrounding <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> is a 20-year House veteran and chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee, but his name has come up in reports on the continuing investigation into the Pentagon purchasing scandal Democrat <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state, clung to a 2,594-vote lead over two-term GOP Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. His prospects were hindered by reports that he accepted $ 57,000 in illegal campaign contributions from an auto dealer. And south of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, four-term GOP Rep. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> trailed state legislator <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopetski </PERSON> by 1,573 votes. So far, only four incumbents seeking re-election had lost. The most prominent was <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, whose 28-year House career was ended by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> newcomer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Machtley </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year on allegations that he accepted favors from lobbyists, is likely to be succeeded as committee chairman by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., was defeated by <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who played good ol' boy Cooter on television's `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' in a mud-slinging contest that focused on <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s perjury indictment in a government drug probe Democrat <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> beat GOP Rep. <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 13th District, and former state Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON> denied Republican Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> 4th District a second term.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s solid victory lacked the majority support of several voter groups, including moderates and Roman Catholics, that would be crucial to a lasting Republican realignment, say poll analysts. The share of voters calling themselves Democrats went up compared with 1984, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll found, while Republican numbers held about steady. Democrats thus were able to gain in other races. `` The Republicans have held on to the numbers they had in 1984, but the Democrats have gone back to their numbers in 1980,'' said <PERSON> Laurily </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief pollster. `` Despite the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory, we've gone back to a situation where the Democrats are the majority party.'' Overall, the polls said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stitched together enough of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coalition of 1980 and 1984 to win the election handily. But they indicated that majority support from some key groups was lacking: _ Catholics voted for <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1976, but solidly for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 Tuesday they went back to the Democrats, backing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 52-48 percent in <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> exit polling. _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> split women with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980 and won women in 1984 Tuesday, a majority of women voted for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. _ Moderates backed <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1976, then moved to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the next two elections Tuesday they voted for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, by 54-46 in NBC-Journal polling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also won independents by smaller margins than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s. And while he pulled in 17 percent of Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> polling, that was down from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s roughly 25 percent in 1980 and'84. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support also seemed to lack a strong personal endorsement from the voters, pollsters said. And his recreation of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coalition paled in comparison, even if partly because <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity is so great `` I do n't think there's a mandate in this data for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>. `` It's certainly a comfortable victory. But there's no overwhelming sentiment for what might be in his new presidency.'' In ABC News exit polling, for example, 45 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s voters said they opposed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> more than they supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> In an even stronger gauge, 14 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers in NBC-Journal polling gave dislike of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the primary reason for their vote. Prosperity was a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trump card. In one survey, most voters said the economy had improved since 1980, and overwhelmingly they backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In another, the economy was the most-often cited issue in candidate selection, and a majority of those voters took <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It was a pretty clear economic kind of thing,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. `` People who said they had benefited from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's economic policies voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. People who said they had n't, voted for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Other issues played in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favor _ such as his experience and his stands on crime _ and he sustained little damage from concern over the qualifications of his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the polls found. Most striking, said <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, was the increase in the number of voters identifying themselves as Democrats. In the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll, 31 percent said they were Republicans, compared to 32 percent in the 1984 election. But 38 percent said they were Democrats, compared to 33 percent in 1984. The movement in party identification did not harm <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity About 55 percent in the CBS-Times poll said they approved of his work as president, while only about 40 percent disapproved; the rest had no opinion.

Remengesau received 1,761 votes, or 19.5 percent. Four other candidates divided the rest of the vote. There is no runoff election when a winning candidate receives less than a majority. Losing candidates have 10 days to challenge the outcome before the vote is officially certified. <PERSON> Kuniwo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, 45, easily won the vice presidency.

 A moderate earthquake shook a wide area of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday evening, but there were no immediate reports of injury or major damage. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> reported a preliminary magnitude of 4.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale with an epicenter 11 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on the Calaveras Fault.

Although the quake was not a major one, it was unusual in that it could be felt over such a wide distance. The temblor was felt at least as far as 200 miles to the north in <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, 120 miles to the south in Seaside in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and 180 miles to the east in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, locked together in political combat for so many months, are going their separate ways: the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president to plan the next administration, his vanquished Democratic opponent to resume his duties as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. After taking the first steps toward the transfer of power next January, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was leaving today on a brief vacation fishing off the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The president-elect returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday and received a tumultuous welcome at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base from supporters that included his vice president-elect, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He's going to be one of the great vice presidents,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator who stood smiling behind him on the platform. `` You watch him closely, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Back at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a news conference he was looking forward to resuming his duties as governor `` vigorously and fully.'' `` I gave it my best shot,'' he said of the losing campaign. Many of his fellow Democrats were complaining that his best shot was not good enough. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign ran the worst campaign of this century,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> complained particularly about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to respond quickly to attacks from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` You just do n't let people do that sort of thing to you,'' said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. `` This race was winnable,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will get a lot of blame, deserved and not deserved.'' In the presidential race, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won 40 states with 426 electoral votes, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> carried 10 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> for a total of 112 electoral votes. But the new president will have to deal with a solidly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when he takes office on Jan. 20, a fact <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> obviously had in mind when he told the airport crowd that `` I'm going to do everything I can to have a good and open and friendly relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' With the outcome certain from all but one race, the Democrats stood to gain one and possibly two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats. The unsettled race was the contest between Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> for the seat being vacated by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> had a slight lead as officials counted 100,000 absentee ballots. If <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> wins that race, the Democratic majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be 55 to 45. If <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> pulls it out, the Democrats would have a 56-44 margin. Despite the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory, Democrats were also adding to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority. With three races still too close to call, the Democrats had won 259 seats compared to 173 for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic candidates held narrow leads in the three unsettled races. Only about half the eligible voters bothered to cast ballots in the 1988 election, according to <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON>, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, the lowest turnout percentage since 1924. `` We had an unprecedented number of voters who said they did n't like either candidate,'' said <PERSON> Gans </PERSON> In his valedictory press conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touched once again on the negative tone of the long campaign. The Republican attacks `` had an impact on me,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. When asked whether he thought the success of those attacks would result in more negative campaigning in the future, he replied, `` I fear that this will be a signal at the national level that this kind of campaigning is effective campaigning. I certainly hope not.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved quickly to set the transition in motion. He announced Wednesday morning that he would name old friend and campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> his secretary of State. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> served the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as White House chief of staff and then <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary.

<HEAD>Evidence Of Hereditary Link To Schizophrenia Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study has found evidence of a hereditary link to schizophrenia, and the discovery could help scientists find new treatments for the disorder that strikes one person in 100. The study published today found evidence that a single gene may help trigger the disease and may predispose people to a personality disorder that makes them loners or to other mental conditions thought unrelated to schizophrenia. Two other studies, however, found no evidence of the gene. The researchers studied 104 members of seven families from <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that had displayed multiple cases of schizophrenia in at least three generations. The study included 39 schizophrenics, five people with `` schizoid personality disorder'' and 10 people with conditions such as depression that are not thought related to schizophrenia. It found that family members who apparently inherited the gene may have acquired an 86 percent risk of developing schizophrenia or one of the other disorders. The work was done by <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurling </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> with colleagues there, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. Two studies of other families have found no evidence of the proposed gene, showing it could not be linked to all cases of schizophrenia, researchers said. `` For all we know, this could be a very minor cause of schizophrenia that only affects some families in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, or it could be a major cause,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Lander </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitehead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Other scientists also said the new work does not prove the gene exists. <PERSON> Lander </PERSON>, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study in today's issue of the British journal Nature, said such genetic research may help researchers split schizophrenia into distinct diseases. That might help in finding treatments, he said. Schizophrenia, which includes severe distortions in perception, speech and thoughts, usually appears in adolescence or early adulthood. A schizophrenic may believe incorrectly that he is the target of a plot or that his thoughts are broadcast to others. People with schizoid personality disorder prefer to be loners. They do not enjoy close personal relationships and say they rarely feel strong emotions. Genes are inherited chemical blueprints that govern the structure and functioning of individual cells in the body. Disease can result when a gene is damaged or some other abnormality appears in its functioning. Genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes. The new study suggests a gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia lies somewhere in a particular portion of the chromosome scientists called number 5. The researchers tracked the inheritance of a portion of chromosome 5 through the families, and compared that pattern with the occurrence of schizophrenia and the other disorders. Results suggested that some gene in the suspected portion of chromosome 5 confers a susceptibility to schizophrenia. The evidence was stronger that the gene affects not only schizophrenia, but also schizoid personality disorder and the seemingly unrelated disorders, <PERSON> Gurling </PERSON> said in an interview. But in his editorial, <PERSON> Lander </PERSON> cautioned that the statistical link to the seemingly unrelated orders is `` not overwhelming,'' and that most cases in the general population are probably due to other causes. The evidence linking the gene to schizophrenia alone is `` very strong'' but `` not overwhelmingly convincing,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, professor of human genetics, psychiatry and biology at the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. The statistical link is stronger if one considers schizoid personality disorder as well as schizophrenia, which adds credibility to the gene hypothesis, he said. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> is co-author of a study in today's Nature that found evidence against existence of a gene for schizophrenia in the chromosome portion Gurling studied. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>'s study focused on an extended Swedish family. Another researcher, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, said her work also has failed to find evidence for the gene Gurling's paper describes. Gurling's work is `` just a suggestion ... not a definitive finding at this point,'' she said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar lost ground Thursday against the Japanese yen while share prices inched down on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar, which stayed on the 123-yen level during its morning session, closed slightly higher at 124.10 yen. Opening at 123.95 yen, the currency moved in a range of 123.76-124 .30 yen It closed Wednesday at 124.65. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, a 205.51-point winner Wednesday, lost 46.36 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 28,166.42. Foreign exchange dealers said it was difficult to feel bullish toward the dollar, with large sell orders blocking the dollar's potential recovery The dollar's slide followed its sharp overnight decline on overseas markets stemming mainly from uncertainties toward the improvement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and budget deficits following <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>' victory, said <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> `` The market had some uncertainties over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> policy before he actually starts his job as president,'' he said. `` But speculative investors were buying the dollar to collect profits, and the dollar is unlikely to drop further.'' <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> had intervened intermittently in the markets to save the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency from further declining.

<HEAD>Children in Alaska Town Submit to Blood Tests For Lead Exposure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly all the children in the historic gold rush town of <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> submitted to blood tests this week to determine if they've been contaminated by exposure to another metal: lead. Alarming levels of lead recently were discovered in <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>'s soil A terminal where truckloads of lead and zinc ore concentrate are loaded onto ships has operated at the edge of the scenic southeast Alaskan tourist town for about 20 years. Preliminary tests showed lead levels up to 560 times the level naturally found in <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>'s soil. State environmental officials said Wednesday they had directed the terminal operator to act immediately to limit the powdery ore's spread from the terminal. State health officials said they will continue to take blood and urine samples through Friday from any resident who wants to be tested. Officials have asked all pregnant women, children and families of terminal workers to submit to the tests because they are most at risk of lead poisoning, which can result in brain damage or death. Officials this week decided to take 50 urine samples from people in high-risk groups because exposure to some of the metals can be more accurately traced that way, said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Public Health Division. By late Wednesday, about 150 people had been tested, including most children of school age and younger, and three pregnant women, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>, which is nearly 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, has about 790 residents. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, chief of the division's laboratory section in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, said the samples will be tested at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and at a lab in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` It sounds like it's going to be about three weeks from Sunday before we get our first inkling of what the numbers look like,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, regional supervisor for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. The samples will be tested for lead and possibly for zinc, mercury, cadmium and other elements, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Officials last week said the soil tests also showed higher than normal levels of those elements. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said the state had sent <ORGANIZATION> Bowhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the terminal operator, a letter ordering additional steps to limit lead exposure. Tractor-trailer rigs carrying huge drums of lead and zinc ore concentrate lumber through town every 35 minutes _ 24 hours a day, 362 days a year _ from a mine at <LOCATION> Faro </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Yukon Territory. State and federal officials and residents previously gave little thought to the ore the trucks tracked through the streets. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bowhead </PERSON> was told to strictly control access to the terminal, which borders a ferry and cruise ship dock where thousands of tourists disembark each spring and summer. At a town hall meeting last week, some residents expressed concern that tourists who walk through the terminal have unwittingly tracked lead into town. The letter also directs Bowhead to wash trucks that become soiled with ore after loading or unloading, and to resweep the route they take through town. Bowhead already had begun cleaning up the terminal site. A 1,000-foot section of railroad tracks where lead levels were extremely high is being removed and the soil will be removed for processing, terminal manager <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Meachum </PERSON> said. Before 1982, ore was transported to the terminal via rail. Testing of soil, well water and <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> is continuing to determine if further cleanup is needed, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> plans to publish a weekly newsletter to keep residents informed of the lead problem, he said. <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Environment in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> said she and a representative of the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> will go to <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> next week to provide residents with information on lead contamination and legal remedies. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said residents asked her organization to send a representative because state and federal agencies had not answered all their questions.

<HEAD>Afghan Leader Calls For Demilitarization Under International Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s prime minister has called for the demilitarization of his country under international supervision, which he said could lead to a coalition government by the end of the Soviet pullout. The prime minister, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON>, on Wednesday also condemned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for supplying weapons to anti-communist guerrillas. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON>, who does not belong to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters his government is `` earnestly hopeful'' the now-suspended Soviet withdrawal can be completed by the Feb. 15 deadline set in a U.N.-mediated pact last April. He indicated, however, that complete withdrawal on schedule depends on whether <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continue supplying arms to the anti-government forces, a practice he said violates the agreement. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> said he envisages a neutral, <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in which `` there could be no discussion of Marxism.'' He said his government probably would propose a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting to discuss how to halt arms supplies by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the Afghan rebels. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, through an interpreter. At the time of the April 14 agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reserved the right to continue supplying the guerrillas if the Soviets continued providing arms to Afghan government forces. Last Friday, the Soviets said they were suspending the withdrawal and delivering new, more powerful weapons to the government because of continuing guerrilla attacks. MiG-27 ground-attack jets and SS-1 Scud missiles have been seen in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. On Wednesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said suspending the withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is an attempt to ensure full compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. An estimated 115,000 were there when the withdrawal began May 15 and about half have been pulled out. The withdrawal agreement is between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signing as guarantors. The insurgents were not party to it and have continued the civil war. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday that no formal request for a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting had been received and Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was `` listening to views'' about the Afghan situation and a possible international forum. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> said his government proposes an international conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices that would `` register and guarantee the neutral status of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and launch a program for the demilitarization of the country under international supervision.'' <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON>, described by the Soviets as a figure of national reconciliation, has been meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but said he had not met representatives of either the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or Afghan insurgents. When asked about the Soviet troop withdrawal, he said: `` We are earnestly hopeful that with the realization of the facts concerning our region, the foreign interference would stop and there would be no reason for such a delay.'' He said new types of weapons were supplied to the insurgents after the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement was signed. As Soviet soldiers began to leave, <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION> declared, `` ground-to-ground missiles entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from the other direction.'' `` New types of sophisticated and destructive weapons are made available to the enemies of peace and constitute the major impediment to implementation of national reconciliation,'' he said. Asked about political ideology in a future <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the premier said: `` I assure you that my government would not let anybody propagate against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> or engage in any activity which would pose a threat to Islam. There could be no discussion of Marxism by this government because the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are predominantly Moslems and they would not accept any other ideology.''

 Democrats maintained their domination in the nation's legislatures by holding Republicans to small gains in state races, and said Wednesday the results strengthened their hand for the redistricting that will follow the 1990 census Republicans estimated they picked up about 16 to 30 seats Tuesday in state legislatures, far fewer than in the last two presidential elections. It also appeared that they lost control of three legislative chambers. Republicans gained 302 seats in 1980 and 330 seats in 1984, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> carried state Republicans on his coattails. `` It's a loss of epic proportions for the Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't leave any fingerprint on the state legislatures.'' Republicans confessed to disappointment with the outcome of state races. `` We would obviously have liked to pick up some more,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON>, a field director for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. She said she hoped for a strong showing in the 1990 elections, the last ones before the redistricting battles of 1991. The number of congressional seats allocated to each state is shuffled every 10 years to reflect population changes. Through their control of state legislatures, Democrats will be able to redraw district lines in a way that will keep safe as many congressional seats as possible for members of their party. In spite of the Republicans' assertion that they had gained seats, the Democrats clearly did better in the number of houses they controlled. Democrats made a net gain of control of one state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and Republicans had a net loss of control of one state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, according to figures compiled by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the National Conference of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. Democrats lost 10 chambers in 1980 and seven chambers in 1984, although they won back some of them in the off-year elections of 1982 and 1986. The elections left Democrats in control of 32 state Senates and 36 state Houses, while Republicans controlled 16 Senates and 11 Houses. In some other state bodies, power was evenly split. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> has a non-partisan, one-house legislature. `` We've held where we've needed to hold and we've picked up seats where we've looked for opportunities,'' the Democrats' <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, director of the state and local department of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We maintained our power base in key state Senates and had pickups in just about every single Southern state.'' The struggle for control of state legislatures centered on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION> said 25 legislatures were controlled by Democrats, eight were controlled by Republicans, and nine were split between the parties. Results for other states were unavailable. Democrats took a 26-16 edge to regain control of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where an even balance of 21 Republicans and 21 Democrats since 1984 had led to a shifting series of coalitions. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the home state of Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Democrats picked up two seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to draw even with Republicans, 50 to 50. Democrats also picked up at least three seats in the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans appeared to take control of the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. With some recounts possible, the balance stood at 76 Republicans and 74 Democrats, in contrast to 77 Democrats and 73 Republicans previously. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Republicans picked up two seats to gain a 27-23 edge in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which had been evenly divided with the Democrats at 25-25. But Democrats grabbed control of the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 51-49, the same margin by which the Republicans had controlled the lower house. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, control of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was undecided late Wednesday. Voters elected 23 Democrats and 21 Republicans, but 16 seats were undecided. Democrats previously had a 31-29 edge. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, a tight <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race had Republicans and Democrats with 24 seats apiece and one district still undecided. Republicans previously had a one-seat advantage, 25-24. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democrats picked up breathing room in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where they widened their lead to 104-99, from 99-97 and seven vacancies. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, Republicans slightly widened their lead in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but continued to trail in the House. Among other big states, Democrats in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> maintained control of both houses, and Democrats in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> maintained their narrow 31-28 edge in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> while keeping a big lead in the House. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Democrats remained firmly in control of the Assembly and picked up at least one seat in the Republican-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 Protestant and Roman Catholic church leaders from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> ended their `` pilgrimage of hope'' on a note of optimism that the troubled <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province might soon know peace. `` We're realizing there is no such thing as green -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- tears or orange -LRB- Protestant -RRB- tears. The people of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> are weeping together _ and this is significant,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON> was one of six high-level church delegates from the four leading denominations of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the republic who participated in a three-day ecumenical institute in this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb. `` A good seed has been planted and surely the harvest will be bountiful,'' the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Our </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savior </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference. The church sponsored the gathering to mark the 90th anniversary of the church's founding in part by <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> immigrants. The religious leaders also urged Americans to refrain from sending donations to paramilitary organizations `` that will destroy our beloved island.'' The Most Rev. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eames </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s Anglican church, said the delegation was flatly opposed to misguided American donations to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, whose current outbreak of political and sectarian violence began in 1969. `` Our message is pure and simple: Money given to paramilitary organizations is money for death, money for misery and money for injury. It is pushing back the chance for reconciliation and peace in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Eames </PERSON> said. Many groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Fund, <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, solicit funds for distribution in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. None acknowledge giving funds for military use by factions such as the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON> joined his interdominational colleagues in urging Americans to closely monitor their donations. `` Do n't take chances with American dollars,'' he said. `` We've shed tears and suffered because of money that has come generously from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and been used woefully.'' The delegation also included Bishop <PERSON> Cahal </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, whose Roman Catholic diocese includes <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>; the Presbyterian moderator in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>; the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>; and the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, professor of Old Testament at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glasgow </ORGANIZATION>. The clerics called <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s conflict a `` young person's tragedy,'' and urged educational integration to promote cross-cultural communication <PERSON> Eames </PERSON> stressed that education was but a part of what he said must be a peaceful formula for political reform. `` It would be wrong if we were to give the impression that education will be the answer to our problems. It is just a part of the jigsaw puzzle,'' he said.

 A <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> human rights group has charged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is trampling on education and breaking international law by closing Palestinian schools and universities in its attempt to end the 11-month-old uprising. The group <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, run by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Western lawyers, called Wednesday for the immediate resumption of classes for the 318,000 students in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The closure by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities of schools and universities for a prolonged period of time is blatantly illegal and constitutes an illegitimate exercise of power by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military,'' the group says in a report entitled `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s War Against Education.'' The army ordered all primary and secondary schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> closed on Feb. 3, saying they served as `` centers of violent protest'' for the Palestinian uprising, which aims to end 21 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Most of the schools were reopened in May or June, but all were shut down again in July. Authorities first said a new school year would begin Sept. 18 but still have not allowed any <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools to reopen. Universities and community colleges have been shuttered since January. The human rights group _ formally known as <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq-Law </PERSON> in the Service of Man and affiliated with the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION> _ says in the 17-page report that more than 300,000 children and 18,000 college-age students are missing out on an education. It says the closure is illegal under both local and international law, including the 1949 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention designed to protect civilians in war and under military occupation. `` The security rationale put forth by the government to justify school closing is neither supported by the facts nor the law,'' the report says. `` It is education itself that is targeted, and that is intended as another means of penalizing the civilians living under occupation.'' An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military official denied the allegations. `` We did n't close schools because we do n't want the Palestinians to study,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Each time we've tried to reopen -LRB- the schools -RRB-, they immediately became again centers of violence and disorder and we had no other choice but to close them.'' The official also hinted that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools were not likely to be reopened on Nov. 15, when the current closure order expires. `` Even today we do n't see that the situation is ready to reopen the system,'' he said. Several Israeli newspapers also have reported the reopening may be delayed. The independent Hebrew daily <ORGANIZATION> Ha'aretz </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the army saw the school shutdown as `` an effective means of pressuring the local population.'' Since the uprising began Dec. 8, at least 310 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> noted that while there also have been violent protests in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, there have been only selective closures of schools there. The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> had 175,000 students in 365 schools. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, it said: `` All 1,194 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools were closed simultaneously without regard for activities at any specific institution.'' It said the blanket closure order appeared `` designed to penalize the -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- community as a whole.'' `` By preventing <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> students of all ages from receiving an education, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities are punishing present and future generations of Palestinians,'' the report says. It also accuses the army of blocking home tutoring of students and of damaging desks and educational equipment in schools that were taken over temporily as military camps or detention centers.

 Over the objections of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is expected to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later this month to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Arab diplomats say <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who along with two <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> diplomats applied Tuesday for a visa to come to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to announce formation of an independent Palestinian state on about Nov. 30 and request <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer status for the new <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> government. The Israeli government and Jewish groups already have protested a visit by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief, and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in a letter made public Wednesday said he did not welcome a visit by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in a Nov. 1 letter to 51 senators who protested any visa for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> wrote, `` Like you, I have no desire whatever to see <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which has no diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is the only organization that must apply for a visa through the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last visited the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in November 1974, when he delivered a 90-minute speech. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission spokeswoman, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, said, `` We do have an obligation to grant a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> under the -LRB- U.S.-U.N. -RRB- Headquarters Agreement.'' Under that 1947 agreement the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agrees to facilitate and not impede the work of diplomats and officials on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> business. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist organization and sought to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission earlier this year. `` We do not deem <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> welcome in any international forum,'' said Israeli Mission Spokesman <PERSON> Barukh </PERSON> <PERSON> Binah </PERSON>. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commited the original sin _ the acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is a terrorist organization in the first place. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has never changed its covenent which still calls for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` and has never renounced terrorism or accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338,'' which recognize the secure borders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is considered the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and is invited to speak during all Middle East debates in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Arizona Women Can Now Legally Run for Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was largely academic, but <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> voters overwhelmingly approved repeal of language in the state constitution that prohibits women from holding such state offices as governor and attorney general. The state's governor and school superintendnent are women, and the provisions are considered unenforceable in any case because of federal law that bars discrimination. Repealed were provisions that allow only males to run for governor, attorney general, state treasurer, secretary of state or superintendent of public instruction. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> voters also approved a constitutional amendment requiring a runoff election whenever the winning candidate for a key state office has failed to get 50 percent of the vote. The proposal was inspired by controversy surrounding Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who defeated Democrat <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> and independent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> for governor in 1986 even though he received only 40 percent of the vote.

<HEAD>Contra Leader Warns Against Direct U.S.-Nicaragua Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Contra leader warned President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against short-circuiting the Central American peace process by holding direct talks with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. `` If the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration establishes direct negotiations with the Sandinista regime, it would be violating the democratic aspirations of the Nicaraguan people,'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, one of seven Nicaraguan rebel leaders backed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, pointed to previous statements by the vice president that he firmly opposes consolidation of a communist regime in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should try to seek bipartisan support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for that policy. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to work through the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace treaty signed last year by five of the region's presidents, including <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, rather than a bilateral approach. Another Contra director, hard-line former military commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, said the struggle in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will continue regardless of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions. The fight `` is not determined by support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said. It is `` Nicaraguans who have made the decision to fight, by rejecting communism.'' But in general Contra leaders welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election over <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has strongly opposed military aid to the rebels. `` He is a loyal man,'' Contra director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people said we are happy with the eight years we had under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ... and that includes, definitely, aid to the resistance.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, unlike <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, had sent the Contras a letter saying he supported their struggle and charging that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have violated peace agreements. `` President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that if the Central American plan did not work, he would definitely consider a request for military aid,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` The plan is not working, the plan has practically failed.'' At a post-victory news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would continue to `` keep the pressure'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to fulfill their commitments under the peace plan and said military aid to the Contras `` will have a high priority.'' The Contras, many of whom have retreated to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, are receiving only humanitarian aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> downplayed the importance of Democratic gains in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, noting that some of the new Democratic senators, such as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, supported the Contras during the campaign.

<TEXT>
 Planned Parenthood officials hoped an anti-abortion ballot measure approved in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> would not affect availabilty of some contraceptives, and pro-choice activists vowed to fight bans on state abortion funding in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> health officials Wednesday reluctantly prepared to implement a ban on tax-funded abortions for poor women that received overwhelmingly approval from voters the day before. `` I think it's a step backward for public policy in this state to deny health care access for one group of people, the very poor,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Babock </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Anti-abortion forces spent $ 2.3 million to persuade voters to retain a 1987 law ending state payments for abortions except when the mother's life is in danger. The pro-choice side was outspent by 3-1. The ban won by 57-43 percent. The state spends about $ 5.8 million a year for some 18,600 abortions for low-income women. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> said he knew of no way to delay implementation of the measure, but a spokeswoman for a pro-choice group said it will look for one. `` Surely there are some options,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Listing </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to End Tax-Funded Abortions, said the group will make certain the ban takes effect and try to persuade lawmakers to spend the abortion funds on programs to help women through crisis pregnancies. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, supporters and opponents of a referendum on a state law banning abortion funding said the vote did n't end the debate. `` I'm not so naive to think this is a mandate on abortion,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodley </PERSON>, who led the fight to uphold the ban. `` But when the voters understood the issue, they realized they did n't want their tax dollars paying for abortion.'' The measure to repeal the ban was defeated 60 percent to 40 percent _ a margin that surprised even the victors. Four years ago, the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Constitution was amended to prohibit state abortion funding. Exceptions include cases where the life of the pregnant woman or unborn child is endangered and when every reasonable effort has been made to preserve the life of each. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorenski </PERSON>, spokesman for the defeated amendment campaign, said his side `` will rebuild and bring it back again.'' <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>' measure, approved by 52-48 percent, bars state funding of abortions unless the mother's life is in danger. It also says state policy is to protect `` unborn children'' starting at conception. Another section states that contraceptives are not affected by its provisions. However, Planned Parenthood of Greater <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> expressed fear that the amendment could be construed to prevent use of the `` morning-after'' pill, which works after conception, even in cases of rape or incest. `` We're asking our opponents to stick to their promises to respect contraceptives and birth control and to not make those things illegal so we will have nowhere to go,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Charbonneau </PERSON>, the chapter's executive director. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Unborn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said `` We have no interest in the morning-after pill.'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said opponents vastly outspent his group. Planned Parenthood said it spent about $ 100,000. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> currently does not fund abortions. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, exulted over the ballot-question results. `` This is an honest view of what the public thinks about -LRB- abortion -RRB- funding,'' he said. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the pro-choice Fund for a Feminist Majority, said the battleground now shifts to the federal level to block the overturning of the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that legalized abortion. `` It is n't going to end until a small minority stops forcing its way on the rest of us,'' she said. Before Tuesday's election, pro-choice advocates had lost only one of 22 state and local referendums nationwide. Thirty-seven states refuse to fund abortions for the poor.

 The <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> school board reluctantly agreed to break its century-old ban on school dances in time for a December homecoming, but members are still hoping an appeals court will reinstate the prohibition. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Flummerfelt </PERSON>, a parent who has been fighting for students trying to stage their first school dance, said she has waited a long time to hear the board grant approval. `` It's finally happened,'' she said. `` It's nice that our high school students get to do what other high school students do.'' The six board members unanimously voted Wednesday to suspend the ban until an appeals court makes a ruling on U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s order. In his ruling in August, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the district must stop enforcing the dance ban because it unconstitutionally promoted the values of <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> residents who opposed dancing for religious reasons. Board members appealed <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s order, but last week the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied their request that the order not be enforced until the appeal was settled. `` We must obey the order of Judge <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, even though we disagree with it,'' schools Superintendent <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> told the board members. <PERSON> Ransom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the attorney representing the school board, stressed that the suspension was temporary. `` The rule is really still on the books, but the application and enforcement are suspended,'' he said.

 Civil war has reduced <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s south to a graveyard in the `` most appalling human tragedy in the world for many years,'' a British overseas development minister says. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>, who just returned from a two-day trip to the vast refugee camps Sudanese have fled to in western <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, said he had been told the overland route to the camps `` is littered with corpses or bones of corpses.'' He estimated at least half the refugees die during the journey, which can take four months, and appealed to the international community to press for peace and stability in the rebel-plagued region of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, `` which has been turned into a graveyard in the last two years.'' `` The physical condition of the Sudanese refugees in the camps in western <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> graphically authenticates the appalling experience of those who had managed to cross the border for a haven in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> said Wednesday. In the past year, the camps' populations have tripled to more than 330,000 as the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has intensified its war against <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s Moslem government. The rebels took up arms in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and social and economic reforms for the predominantly Christian and animist south. <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> urged the rebels to allow relief agencies to deliver humanitarian aid to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, where the rebels claim to control 95 percent of the countryside and towns. In September, the rebels ambushed a convoy transporting relief supplies and killed seven Kenyan truck drivers. The killing caused Kenyan drivers to boycott entering southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. As a result, more than 1,200 tons of emergency supplies from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> were stranded in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor A World Food-sponsored airlift of supplies started Oct. 26 and continues. The rebels also repeatedly have threatened to shoot down aircraft _ military or commercial _ that fly over southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. In 1986 and 1987, the rebels downed two commercial airplanes, killing 73 people. At least two large cargo jets have been hit this year, but landed safely. <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> also visited camps in eastern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> that hold about 350,000 Somalis. The refugees started arriving in May, fleeing fighting between the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and government troops. <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> said their physical condition was much better than that of the Sudanese refugees, but water was scarce in the region and had to be trucked to them over poor roads. The Ministry of Overseas Development is responsible for all British aid to Third World countries.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> bid an emotional farewell to public life, conceding defeat in his attempt to win a fourth term and vowing never to return to politics after his first loss in 26 years. `` I always said to myself, ` When your time comes, walk off that field. No regrets, no excuses, no blaming, no griping, no comebacks. Walk off,''' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, 57, said Wednesday, tears in his eyes. The liberal Republican lost his seat in a razor-thin upset Tuesday by Attorney General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, a conservative Democrat. Family, friends and campaign supporters gathered at <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> the day after for what <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> described as his farewell appearance. `` Here is where it began,'' he said. `` Here is where it ends.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, heir to the Squibb pharmaceutical fortune, began his political career in this exclusive southern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> town in 1962 as a state representative. He won election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> two years later. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> gained national prominence for early and sharp criticism of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration during the Watergate scandal and later as a chief opponent of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative social agenda. He became one of the most successful Republicans ever in Democrat-dominated <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> by stressing his independence and refusal to toe the party line. But that maverick streak helped lead to his ouster as many conservative Republicans, following the lead of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, backed the Democratic challenger. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, whose career was highlighted by his stinging rhetoric and love of a good fight, refused to place the blame on anyone but himself. `` I'm a big guy. I take care of myself. I take shots, I've given shots,'' he said. `` I'm responsible for last night's results.'' Official totals gave <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> 688,494 votes, or 49.76 percent, to 678,442, or 49.04 percent, for <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> late Wednesday. Two third-party candidates shared the rest of the vote. <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said the 10,052-vote margin represented <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s tightest statewide election since an attorney general's contest in 1970, but not close enough to order a recount `` I did n't lose this race by a few thousand votes. In my mind and in my heart, I lost it by 100,000. ... This was n't a close race,'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said, calling the result `` a clear mandate by the people of the state of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'' and attributing it to support of <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>'s positions and opposition to his. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said the outcome reflected the voters' desire for change and `` a desire for an advocate for the state, which of course is what I've been as attorney general _ environment, consumers, jobs, housing, drugs.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> repeatedly stressed that he would not seek the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 1990 or any other public office, including a post in the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. He said he would focus on family and friends and his passion for sports and marine science, and said he might choose an academic career. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said he had no regrets about his legislative career and was proud of his accomplishments, especially his fights against school prayer, anti-busing proposals and other constitutional issues that `` nobody else would touch with a 10-foot pole'' during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` Not one word of that Constitution is different today than when I walked out on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor'' 18 years ago, he said. `` Thank you, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, for giving me the opportunity that any other person would dream of. And goodbye.''

<TEXT>
 Residents are gleeful, proud and a bit apprehensive about what could become of their seaside community of 4,500 people now that summer resident <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been elected president. `` I think everyone's real excited,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anuszewski </PERSON> said Wednesday as she worked at The Lobster Port, a shopping center <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequents about a mile from his family compound. `` But no one really knows what to expect about its effect on the town.'' Except for during World War II, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spent every summer since he was a child in this town 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Residents speak of the 64-year-old <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his family reverently, and even those worried about the consequences admit that having the president nearby is an honor. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, a Republican member of the town's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION>, said residents are happy for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but said there is concern about the potential for a rise in tourism. The streets are already clogged daily between May and September. `` I am proud. I'm pleased he'll be here,'' said <PERSON> Gerda </PERSON> <PERSON> Towne </PERSON>, who owns two stores at the Port. `` But the merchants have got to be sure the town does n't go to pot. We do n't want any honky tonks.'' Ocean Avenue, the winding, narrow road where the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family lives, is often lined with cars bearing people who sit and stare at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compound. Many locals say they fear those crowds will grow. `` I'm a little leery because I do n't know what costs the town will incur,'' <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> said. `` Every bus tour that comes into southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> will swing into town. But still, there's a sense of pride in him, a feeling it's our town that could be the center of attention.'' Republican friends of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have hired a local artist to paint a 36-foot banner to hang across Dock Square when the Bushes return to town. `` Welcome Home,'' the banner says. `` George Our President And <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION>, Our Hopes And Prayers Are With You.'' <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents already have met with town officials to discuss the precautions that must be undertaken now that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be president, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. What changes will take place are still unclear, however, and town police have yet to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We just do n't know what to expect,'' Town Manager <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. `` Rumors are running rampant.'' Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said he hopes to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials by the end of the week. One security-related worry concerns the lobstermen who pull their traps from waters around the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compound during warm weather. There has been speculation the fishermen will be ordered away. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would forgo <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> if it means others will suffer. Statements like that have generated affection for the president-elect. `` He's just a real nice guy, a down to earth guy,'' <PERSON> Anuszewski </PERSON> said. `` My dad has known <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a long time, and he plays golf with him,'' she said. `` We're all really proud of him, but he's still the same guy was before.

<HEAD>Investigation Under Way For Attacker Of Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police rushed out 400 officers today to investigate a series of attacks in a residential zone east of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in which six children as young as age 2 have been stabbed in the stomach. <PERSON> Kaichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said a police helicopter was also flown over residential areas 21 miles east of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to broadcast warnings to children not to walk alone on city streets. The stepped-up police effort came after a two-year-old boy was stabbed by a man with a sharp object while playing alone on a street in front of his house Wednesday. An hour later, another 3-year-old boy was also stabbed by an unknown assailant while playing alone about two miles away, <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said. Known for its relatively low crime rate, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had 1,291 cases of reported crime per 100,000 people last year, compared to 5,480 cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, figures from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> show. `` Those attacked were all young children. ... Their description of an assailant was so vague,'' <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said. He said at least four similar cases were reported in a nearby town and cities in neighboring <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, since last month. In each case, children were stabbed in the stomach while playing alone, police said. Crimes against children in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, while rare, have grabbed headlines whenever such incidents occur. In one such case in September 1987, the body of a 5-year-old boy was found naked in a river bed two days after he was kidnapped and an anonymous telephone caller demanded $ 161,000 ransom. The case remains unsolved.

<HEAD>17 Prisoners Injured in Calif. Jail Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL CAJON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jail riot sparked by racial tensions between blacks and Hispanics who were crammed into a cell block six times too small left 17 prisoners injured, one critically, authorities said. About 150 men in a cell block designed to hold 24 fought with each other for 20 minutes Wednesday night with weapons made from mop handles, window shards, disassembled bunk beds and sharpened plastic spoons, Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` We had darn near everybody in the cell block fighting at one point,'' said <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cajon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>. `` They just got tired out and after 20 minutes of fighting, they started looking for cover.'' Deputies inside the jail do not carry guns, so they had to wait until the inmates quit fighting before they could enter the cell block and restore order, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The two most seriously injured prisoners were flown to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. One was in critical condition with head injuries suffered in a 14-foot fall from the cell block's upper tier to the concrete floor. The other was in serious but stable condition with a stab wound to the neck. Neither of their identities was immediately available. Seven other prisoners were injured seriously, but the nature of their injuries was n't immediately available, officials said. No guards were injured, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. The fight began when inmates were watching television and milling around outside their seventh-floor cells during a recreation period, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. Each of the 45-square-foot cells in the block houses an average of nine inmates, so they have been allowed to gather in a common recreation area until 10 p.m. each night, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. It was the third apparently racially motivated brawl between blacks and Hispanics at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail in the past five months, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The jail was designed for 120 inmates, but usually houses more than 700 because of a countywide shortage of jail space and a court-imposed inmate cap at the central jail in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` We're going to be moving some bodies around to different jails tonight,'' sheriff's dispatcher <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said.

 A Chinese seismologist estimated today that more than 1,000 people were killed in the earthquake that struck a heavily forested and remote mountain region of southwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last weekend. Rescue workers, meanwhile, were reported still trying to reach isolated areas that may have been badly hit by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s worst earthquake in 12 years. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, provided the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> with the death estimate. The agency also quoted him as saying more than 80 percent of the houses in the stricken area near <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> had collapsed. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said most of the houses in the region, inhabited mainly by ethnic minority groups, were made of bamboo and wood. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 938 people were killed in Sunday's temblor, which measured 7.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said 699 bodies had been recovered in the <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> area of southern <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province, at the epicenter. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported 1,986 people injured. But the extent of the disaster remained unclear because of the remoteness of the region and heavy damage to communications and transportation links. <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> provincial official <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Weijin </PERSON> said today that rescue workers were still trying to reach isolated mountain pockets where people may have been hurt or killed. <PERSON> Seismologist </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> based his casualty estimate on the geographic conditions of the stricken area and comparisons with other catastrophic quakes, including a 1976 quake that killed 242,000 in the northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said rescue teams were being forced to trek on foot through heavily forested mountain terrain to reach some villages. The village of <LOCATION> Zhanmapo </LOCATION>, believed the worst hit with 297 dead, was accessible only by a footpath that was blocked by a landslide. The Richter scale records ground motion in an earthquake as measured by seismographs. A tremor of 6.0 is capable of causing considerable destruction in a populated area and a quake measuring 7.0 is 10 times as powerful. Sunday's quake of 7.6 was the most deadly since the 1976 <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION> tremor, which measured 7.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. As of Wednesday morning there had been 184 aftershocks, and <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said aftershocks would continue for about two months.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $ 48 million to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of about 8,000 farmers in 10 states whose applications for drought insurance were denied by the insurer. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said it would deposit $ 48.1 million with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here early next week as part of the out-of-court settlement reached Wednesday. `` This means the farmers are going to get 100 cents on the dollar and not have to pay any attorney fees,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, the lead attorney in the class-action suit. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said the interest on the deposited money also would go to the farmers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> has said that hearings may be held in the 10 states for farmers who want to be heard further. The final agreement will be submitted to <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, who had suggested the two sides seek an agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it decided to settle for several reasons. It said that in October, when the case was being prepared for trial, there was evidence `` which substantially affected <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to pursue the defense of this litigation. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said that evidence included testimony of witnesses indicating that officials of <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which served as agents in selling the insurance, `` had acted contrary to <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s specific instructions in several material respects. This newly discovered evidence dictated that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> pursue a settlement rather than protracted and costly litigation.'' Officials of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.Y.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment until they had seen a copy of <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s statement and the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said he will ask that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s records for the drought insurance be audited and that the court appoint a master to invest and pay out the money. The lawsuit was scheduled for trial Jan. 3 before <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. The farmers alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, unfairly denied them insurance against crop damage caused by this year's severe drought <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> began rejecting payments in the middle of the year when it said that brokers sold more coverage than planned. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the company was prepared to sell about $ 40 million in coverage, but brokers had sold more than $ 300 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said the $ 48 million should be enough to cover anticipated payments to farmers who did n't receive policies, as well as expenses, attorneys' fees and other distributions determined by <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. The farmers will receive amounts equal to the losses that would have been covered if they had been policy holders, minus what the premiums would have cost and any goodwill payments already made to them by <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON> said last week that the company had made $ 11 million in goodwill payments to drought insurance applicants and planned no additional payments. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of farmers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

 Students will regain extracurricular activities and a previously forfeited basketball season could be salvaged because voters approved a property tax levy that had failed in six previous elections. Residents of this village 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION> voted 1,791-1 ,627 on Tuesday to approve a five-year emergency operating levy that was the largest of the 233 school tax issues on <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> ballots `` More people came out -LRB- to vote -RRB- and I know some people switched,'' said school Superintendent <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON>. `` I think they realized that not only was our school district in trouble, but that a lot of other districts were in trouble. `` It's back to picking up the pieces, but we're glad to be picking them up,'' <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Meissner </PERSON>, who coached the <ORGANIZATION> Columbiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> boys' basketball team until athletics were canceled this year, said former players asked him whether the 350-student school could have a team this year `` That was their first question after the vote,'' <PERSON> Meissner </PERSON> said. `` Winter sports _ boys' and girls' basketball and wrestling _ depends on numbers of players and ... whether we can get enough games to have a meaningful season,'' he said. The coach said the school gave up its league schedule after a levy proposal failed in August. It was the sixth straight failure of a tax proposal. Students said they were left with little to do after a budget deficit projected at $ 425,000 this year forced officials to cut all extracurricular activities and some elective classes. Players from <LOCATION> Columbiana </LOCATION>'s former league champion football team transferred this year to neighboring districts so they could continue playing, <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON> said. One student left recently so he could play basketball in a neighboring district. The new Columbiana levy, which starts in January, is expected to raise $ 875,000 a year, <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON> said. New revenues in the remainder of the school year will be used to repay $ 215,000 the district borrowed from banks and the state to cover this semester's shortfall.

<TEXT>
 A key prosecution witness in the trial of an accused mercy killer admitted his role in the death of his terminally ill stepsister and said his family's efforts to kill her were `` acts of love.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>, who was granted immunity from prosecution before his role in <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>'s death was known, testified Wednesday that he joined her husband in acts leading to her death on Jan. 15, 1986, at the age of 43. <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Myers </ORGANIZATION> pathologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, 47, is on trial for first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of his wife, who was already dying from cancer of the lungs, brain and adrenal glands. <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> said it was his layman's opinion that the family's acts were illegal but described them as `` acts of love'' for Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> asked the <LOCATION> Kentfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, man if he thought it was fair for him, his brother <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and father <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> to walk free with immunity while Rosier is on trial. `` I do n't think it's fair for anyone to be on trial for this case,'' <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> testified, adding that he did n't want to see his brother-in-law go to jail. Rosier was indicted 11 months after his wife's death when he said in a television interview that he `` administered something to terminate her life'' and wrote a book about how she died. He is accused of providing his wife with 20 tablets of the sedative Seconal and administering morphine injections and suppositories. Most of her relatives knew she planned to commit suicide and wanted to die at home peacefully, <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> testified. But Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> survived through the night of Jan. 14 after the drugs were administered, <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> said. `` If I had the guts, I'd put a pillow over her face,'' <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, his father and brother as they waited outside her bedroom early in the morning of Jan. 15. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> then said, `` I do n't want to hear about the end,'' <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> testified that his father, a semi-retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> dentist, took matters in his own hands and smothered her by placing his hands over her nose and mouth. She died 10 minutes later, <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> told the jury he would have lied about his father's part if they had n't been given immunity. But Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> questioned why <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> had called <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> after the television interview to warn him of possibile liability if <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> did n't know he had smothered his wife.

<TEXT>
 A moderate earthquake shook a wide section of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, knocking items off grocery shelves but causing no injuries or major damage. The quake Wednesday night had a magnitude of 4.7 on <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> gave a preliminary reading of 4.5, with an epicenter 11 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on the Calaveras Fault. Most who felt the quake described it as two sharp jolts, but said it was not frightening. At the Alpha Beta supermarket in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, kitchen items, jar lids and a can fell off the shelves, said clerk <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Depiro </PERSON>. `` It was shaking, rattling and rumbling,'' he said. `` I was bagging groceries and I heard things start rumbling and falling, so I paid attention. I just enjoyed it.'' The 9:08 p.m. temblor occurred at about the same location as did a magnitude 5.0 quake June 12. That quake caused slight damage. Wednesday's quake was felt in an area stretching at least 200 miles to the north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, 120 miles to the south in Seaside in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and 120 miles to the east in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and several other <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area communities reported dozens of phone calls about the temblor, but none received reports of structural damage or injuries. The Richter scale is used to describe the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Each increase of one number on the scale means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage, while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.

 Police said a woman whose daughters told them she died after being beaten by two thugs attempting to take $ 11 she planned to spend on Christmas gifts was not attacked and actually died of a heart attack. <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> police said Wednesday that their investigation found that <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> received a head injury Saturday during an argument with a man she had been dating, not in the parking lot of a <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> store as her daughters reported Monday. `` The story is not true,'' <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure if the mother told the story to her daughters or if the daughters made it up, but it is not true.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> was hospitalized after a man she had been dating for about two years hit her, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> apparently fell during the scuffle at a motel and hit her head on a bed, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> was admitted to a hospital for treatment of the head injury. She died of an unrelated heart attack Monday afternoon, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said the boyfriend would not be charged. Mrs. <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON>'s daughters, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, 26, said Monday their mother told them she was beaten by two men at a department store parking lot. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> said her mother told her the men tried unsuccessfully to take her purse before they were chased away by bystanders.

 The army opened fire and killed at 15 people when thousands of anti-government demonstrators defied curfews today in three towns in the Sinhalese heartland, police said. Thirty others were injured, <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> police said. A military spokesman in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> confirmed soldiers had `` taken action'' against violent demonstrations, but he said he did not know how many people were killed or injured. He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, heavily armed security troops stood guard as three people formally declared their candidacy for president of this island wracked by war and crippled by civil unrest and strikes. No demonstrations were reported in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. But in the <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tissmaharama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monaragala </LOCATION> districts south and east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, demonstrators defied around-the-clock curfews, police in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said. At least five people were killed in each of the districts, they said. Security troops on Wednesday were issued shoot-on-sight orders in case of demonstrations against the government, state radio said. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, soldiers in armored cars blocked roads leading to the town hall as nomination papers were presented for the Dec. 19 presidential election. About 1,000 police with automatic weapons watched as election commissioner <PERSON> Chanchrananda </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> accepted the documents. The candidates are former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Ramasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, candidate of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonesekera </PERSON>, representing the three-party <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who has governed since 1977, is prohibited by law from seeking another term and has said he will step down after a successor is sworn in. But a Sinhalese extremist group is demanding he resign before the elections, charging the current government is incapable of conducting fair elections. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> wants parliament dissolved and a caretaker government set up to oversee the balloting. The front pressed its demands on Monday by launching a four-day strike that shut down businesses throughout much of the island, resulted in shortages of food and fuel and prompted thousands of foreign tourists to cut short vacations. The front opposes the government's peace overtures to end a 5-year Tamil insurgency that has claimed more than 8,500 lives. The government blames the front for the deaths of more than 550 people, most of them Sinhalese supporters of the government. The front says <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who is Sinhalese, has offered too many concessions to the Tamil ethnic minority. Most Sinhalese are Buddhists, while most Tamils are Hindus. This week's strike has closed most shops and banks. Prices for some food, mostly fruit and vegetables, have skyrocketed as much as 300 percent. Troops have been posted throughout the capital. Soldiers have been driving public buses and distributing fuel to state gasoline stations where motorists wait up to five hours in line. And the navy moved into <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> port after dock workers refused to report for duty. On Wednesday, the government declared power, water and health services, ports, communications, railroads, public transport and radio and television essential services subject to emergency law. It said employees who refused to return to work would be fired. Despite the warning, more than 70 percent of the employees failed to show up for their shifts, officials said. Security forces received orders Wednesday to shoot anyone demonstrating against the government. No such demonstrations were reported. Nighttime curfews were imposed. The strike also disrupted the island's tourist industry, which this year reported an increase for the first time since ethnic violence flared in 1983. About 9,000 tourists were evacuated Tuesday from the south coast, where most resorts are located, after the front told the hotels to close or face attacks. Special charter flights left Wednesday with about 3,000 tourists from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> and more flights were planned, tour operators said. <PERSON> Asker </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosajee </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the government had advised foreign tour groups the country was facing shortages and unsettled political conditions. `` We have not told foreigners to leave the country, but if people are scared, there's not much we can do,'' he said. `` We have advised tour groups that curfews and shortages may make the packages they are offering below standard.''

<HEAD>Woman Awarded $3 Million In Parole Board Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court has awarded $ 3 million to a woman who was shot and paralyzed from the neck down by a paroled inmate, ruling that the parole board members who voted to free the prisoner were negligent. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>, 47, sued the three members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that voted to release <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> in 1984. Just five weeks after his release to a halfway house in January 1985, <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> in the parking lot of a Jackson bank. Wednesday's verdict by a <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury was made possible by a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last May that <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> had the right to sue the board members. Two years earlier, a judge dismissed the litigation, saying members were immune under state law because they had acted in their official capacity. During the three-day trial that began Monday, District Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> testified that a state form asking if <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> should be paroled had arrived after he was freed. The jury deliberated five hours before awarding <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> $ 2.5 million in actual damages and $ 500,000 in punitive damages. The suit had asked for $ 4 million. <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>, praising the verdict, said that while `` nothing can replace what I've lost ... if it can change the system, it'll all be worthwhile.'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> called the jurors' decision `` very disappointing.'' `` They were not to consider whether <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> should have been paroled,'' he said. `` They were to determine whether the <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was grossly negligent.'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> warned the verdict could set a dangerous precedent. `` Any agency, any employer, anybody who works for the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> will be affected,'' he said. `` If they make any decision, they will have to pay for it.'' Exactly who would pay the damages remains uncertain. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said that if the state loses on appeal, he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to cover any damages required to be paid individually by board members <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Figgs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. At the time of his parole, <PERSON> Jimpson </PERSON> was serving a life sentence for the murder of a Jackson convenience store clerk. The 60-year-old is now serving a sentence of life without parole for shooting <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Football Coach Fired For Running Up The Score</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A boys' football coach whose powerhouse team rolled to an undefeated season has been fired for allowing his players to pile on the points. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> was dismissed Wednesday as offensive coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, a team of boys 10 to 12 years old whose 9-0 record included such lopsided scores as 32-0, 22-0, 32-8 and 28-8. <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> rules say that after a 17-point lead, the winning team has to ease up to keep from demoralizing its opponents. Because most of the <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>' points came in the first quarter, the best players would have had to sit on the bench most of the game, and <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said that was not fair. `` I'm not in favor of running up the score, but I do n't see anything wrong with a shutout,'' he said. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said he was suspended Monday when he refused orders from league management to allow an opposing team to score 12 points. He was dismissed two days later. Quarterback <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, 12, who engineers the team's triple reverses and sophisticated wishbone attack, said he sees nothing wrong with punishing his opponents. `` Football is supposed to be a mean sport,'' he said. `` That's what the game of football is all about You should n't be punished because you're good.''

<HEAD>Precious Stone Carving Is Returned From the United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> museum today returned an ancient stone carving to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> more than 20 years after it disappeared from a temple. The carving of a Hindu god arrived aboard a flight from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and was to be placed at the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rong </LOCATION> temple in the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Buri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ram </LOCATION>. The carving, `` The Birth of Brahma With Reclining Vishnu on a Makara,'' disappeared from the temple in the 1960s. It was bought by a dealer in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, who sold it to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealer, who sold it to the <ORGANIZATION> Alsdorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The foundation donated it to the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has sought its return for 15 years, and government officials held sensitive talks with the art institute this year. The institute said this week it was donating the 1,000-year-old carving to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> so the restoration of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rong </LOCATION> temple could be completed. The issue took on nationalistic tones when government officials and the media accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of bullying its friend in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, virtually all Thai newspapers ran an open letter calling on Americans to help return the carving. Some Thais said the carving had been `` stolen'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, experts privately concede that many priceless art objects are smuggled out of the country through the help of corrupt government officials.

 Israeli soldiers opened fire today on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters who were hurling stones in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> doctors said seven teen-agers were wounded. The confrontations followed the fatal shooting Wednesday of a 3-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> boy, <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganima </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports say the boy was shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, but the military said it was investigating the circumstances. During a tour of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, southern commander Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> expressed regret over the toddler's death. `` I'm sorry about the death of the child. I urge residents of areas where there is trouble to keep their children at home and not in the playgrounds and certainly not in places where youths disturb order,'' he said on the radio. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, meanwhile, soldiers raided seven Palestinian homes Wednesday night in the market area of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, smashing windows, vandalizing furniture and beating up residents, Palestinian witnesses said. The Palestinians said the raid was the third this week. They said soldiers used ladders to climb through windows and ordered residents onto the streets to remove barricades from roads and paint over anti-Israeli grafitti. The Hebrew daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said a number of Palestinians were detained in the the raids, which it said were aimed at preventing violence during the meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting begins Saturday. Today's violent protests broke out in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Balah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and the village of <LOCATION> Adassan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> reports said. Seven Palestinian teen-agers were hit by army gunfire, including a 14-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy who were seriously wounded in the chest in the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> camp, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. The army imposed curfews on the areas and the Jabaliya, Nusseirat and <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camps and the Shejayieh neighborhbood of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where the toddler was killed. The curfew confined 173,000 Palestinians to their homes. The child was shot in the chest Wednesday when an army jeep was pelted with stones and troops responded with gunfire, an Arab reporter said. Officials at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shifa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the boy was dead on arrival. Family members said <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> was playing nearby when the shooting occurred. In the same incident, a 12-year-old Palestinian was shot in the jaw and a 13-year-old was wounded in the leg, hospital officials said. An army spokesman in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> who demanded anonymity confirmed the death, saying: `` We are questioning troops to see if the death resulted from army shooting.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, public transportation was halted and shops closed Wednesday in the latest strike against the Israeli occupation of the territories captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The strike marked the start of the 12th month of uprising that began Dec. 8. It has claimed the lives of 310 Arabs and 11 Israelis.

<TEXT>
 The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> warned British soldiers today to get their families out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> or face attacks on their living quarters. The warning followed a car bombing Tuesday night that extensively damaged a military housing complex at <LOCATION> Campsie </LOCATION>, four miles outside the north coast city of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gave a warning 30 minutes before the blast and the area was quickly evacuated, but two policemen were treated for shock and a soldier sustained cuts, police said. On Wednesday, in a statement circulated to <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> media, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> took responsibility for the bombing and said: `` We now warn all military personnel that they must remove their families from the occupied north of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' Married quarters have not been a target of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in recent years in the outlawed organization's campaign to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. But the statement said: `` All army housing estates, or similar identifiable areas, henceforward will be liable to attack.'' `` No longer can the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> tolerate the ridiculous situation where British soldiers can come into nationalist areas, raid and systematically wreck homes, harass people, make arrests and then retire just a few miles away to the comfort of their families,'' the statement said. By `` nationalist areas,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was referring to <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> districts where it draws its support, and which are the focus of military and police counter-insurgency measures.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today begins a long-awaited rest at the end of a rigorous campaign, but the president-elect says he will be wielding a telephone as well as a fishing pole during his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation as he considers the makeup of his administration. After announcing Wednesday that he will appoint his campaign manager, former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, as his secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, the vice president said he intends to divulge `` within a couple of weeks'' the other members of his cabinet. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where he spent election night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference he was choosing <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, his campaign chairman and longtime friend, to succeed Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The president-elect also appointed his chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, and campaign pollster and strategist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> to head a transition team. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would name his cabinet `` fairly soon, but certainly not before I come back from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'' on Monday. `` I'll be thinking about it. I'll be trying to sort that out. Probably have a series of announcements within a couple of weeks.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to do some fishing at <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and added, `` I just want to relax and get on the telephone.'' On the first day after his presidential victory over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the day with Episcopalian church services, and later said, `` That is probably the first moment when I realized the enormity of it all.'' The president-elect received congratulatory messages from Soviet General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other world leaders, and spoke by telephone to well-wishers from both sides of the political fence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was welcomed home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by thousands of supporters and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who he predicted will be `` one of the great vice presidents.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, joined by their wives, traveled to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who paid tribute to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying, `` to those who sometimes flatter me with talk of a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution, today, my hope is this: You ai n't seen nothin' yet.'' At his <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his reaction to his victory was `` somewhere between total exhilaration and recognition that the challenge ahead is going to be awesome. ... There's a seriousness that takes over right this minute.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the several thousand people who gathered to greet him at an airplane hangar at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, `` I have a sense of blooming. I have a sense of spring ... a wonderful new era, rich with possibility and full of hope.'' He also said he had received a warm message from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and had sent a message back so that `` we can keep this new bilateral relationship moving ahead.'' He said he does not plan to jump in too early to succeed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whom he called `` one of the great heroes of the modern era.'' `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is still the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I will not be using the transition to try to make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the president's,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In the aftermath of a campaign that saw Congress-bashing as a regular part of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stump speech, the president-elect said he wants to put the heat of the campaign behind him and mend fences with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't want us to talk at each other. I want to talk to each other,'' he said. The vice president said he had received congratulatory calls from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s King Fahd and from Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 With candles, prayers and a pealing of church bells, Americans marked the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the `` night of broken glass'' that shattered lives and illusions as it ushered in the Nazi Holocaust. Synagogues, churches and schools in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and other cities on Wednesday commemorated the Nazi riots of Nov. 9, 1938, when scores of Jews were killed and more than 1,100 synagogues set afire. The anniversary also was marked in cities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We knew that what was happening in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> then was a turning point in anti-Semitism,'' Holocaust author and Nobel laureate <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, a concentration camp survivor, said today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` People did n't ignore it, governments did. People knew of the suffering. ... It was wrong. We could have saved all German Jews. With 50,000 visas we would have saved every single man, woman and child of Jewish faith. But somehow nothing was done.'' `` We all had before the Holocaust the hope of betterment of man,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> told about 100 people at <ORGANIZATION> Ezra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` This day is one of reflection on a day of broken glass and shattered dreams.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told nearly 1,000 people who attended a service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral about the candle burning in the window of his residence. `` I light that candle to tell anyone in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- who -RRB- out of hatred of Jews wants to shatter glass or paint swastikas _ shatter the glass of my house, paint the swastikas on my house, for a spiritual Semite lives therein,'' he said. Fifty years ago Wednesday, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON>, ordered <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> thugs to attack Jewish homes, businesses and temples after a German diplomat was slain in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> gave the night its name, German for `` crystal night,'' because shards of broken glass littered the streets. Many historians believe it marked the start of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> campaign to wipe out European Jews. <PERSON> Gretel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> remembers finding her dog dead on the doorstep of her <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> home, shot by <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON>. `` For me, it's impossible to think Kristallnacht happened half a century ago,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, 80. `` Every day since, I've lived like it was only last night. Ms. <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> agreed that the night could have been called one of shattered illusions. `` My twin brother had already emigrated to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as I wanted to,'' she said. `` But right up to'38 my father kept saying: ` It will pass. Do n't worry. These Nazi thugs are not the real <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.''' New Yorker <PERSON> Fannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joelson </PERSON>, a survivor who never saw her father and husband again after they were taken away by storm troopers on Kristallnacht, said the memories were `` very painful for us.'' `` We saw too much, we hurt too much. We do not want to remember,'' she said. `` But we do remember. How can we forget?'' Those who did not suffer through Kristallnacht must not forget either, said former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Kristallnacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Remembrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must remain vigilant and not allow even the smallest seed of anti-Semitism to take root,'' <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> told the audience at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetscher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> stood side by side with Rabbi <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Auerbach </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> at an inter-faith ceremony. <PERSON> Fetscher </PERSON> prayed for `` living memories so we can never forget.'' The congregations have grown close since Bet <PERSON> Shira </PERSON> was desecrated Feb. 28. Fifty windows were smashed and words such as `` Die Jew'' were spray painted on the walls. Members of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, three blocks away, responded by putting a blue Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> in front of their building. At <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boulevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' oldest synagogue, a commemorative program featured keynote speaker <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuermer </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter stationed in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> during Kristallnacht. `` I was absolutely astonished then and I am astonished today. We have not paid attention enough to its significance,'' <PERSON> Thuermer </PERSON> said. Synagogues in 12 cities, presented the premiere of an oratorio `` Stars in the Dust,'' which `` describes the disintegration of German society into a society that attacked its own population,'' said <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who participated in a performance of the work at Congregation Beth El of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. Other cities included <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, he said In <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, the Jewish community held a candlelight service on the steps of the Capitol at which a proclamation issued by Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was read. Former Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' during his 1984 campaign strained relations between blacks and Jews, called for a healing between the two groups as he joined in a ceremony in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The anniversary `` gives us a unique opportunity to share together and come together,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We must get beyond anti-Semitism, beyond racism.''

<TEXT>
 The maker of an electronic hair-removal system made false and misleading claims that the device could permanently eliminate unwanted hair, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled. The decision, made public Wednesday, upholds a 1987 administrative law judge's ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Removatron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The commission issued an order prohibiting the company from making false and misleading claims, requiring it to inform past purchasers of the product about the ruling and ordering it to place labels on its products stating that it has no proof that its machines produce anything other than temporary hair removal. The company sells devices, called <PERSON> Removatron </PERSON>, that use tweezers to remove hairs, while at the same time transmitting radio waves to the hair roots. It has claimed that this process eventually destroys the hair root tissue and prevents future growth. The machines, which cost about $ 4,000 each, are sold to beauty salons and other businesses, which offer hair-removal service to customers. Under terms of the order the company must halt its claims unless it can produce `` competent and reliable scientific'' evidence that the machines will work.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists wo n't be able to move into a new $ 23 million government laboratory until at least next year because of problems with a ventilation system designed to keep deadly viruses from escaping, officials said. `` They want to be sure before they clear a system like that for people like me to crawl under a hood and begin working with a hot virus,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowlkes </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s retrovirus laboratory. Viruses that will be studied at the lab include those causing AIDS and <ORGANIZATION> Lassa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fever </ORGANIZATION>, which has been responsible for epidemics of hemorrhagic fever in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. Ribbon cutting at the building was last month, but the ventilation-system problems have delayed occupancy by an estimated 80 researchers, officials said. The ventilation system is designed to keep air pressure inside the building's 12 laboratories slightly below normal so that air from the hallways always flows into the labs to keep microbes from being carried out. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> engineer responsible for operating the air system, said the problems involve the 96 pneumatic control units whose delicate sensors and valves measure and adjust air pressure throughout the building. For unknown reasons, changes in air pressure, such as those caused by an open door, throw the gauges out of adjustment.

<TEXT>
 A man convicted two years ago for landing a small plane on the Champs Elysees had his pilot's license suspended today for three years for flying 1,000 feet over <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on a bet. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> also was fined $ 8,300 for violating civil aviation regulations for a low pass he made over the Champs Elysees on Oct. 13. <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Lienart </PERSON> denied his 52-year-old client is the `` Black Baron,'' a pilot who for months evaded <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police while making midnight flights over <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> rooftops. French newspapers had speculated that <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> was the elusive pilot. <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> told the court he had been a pilot for 31 years and a flight instructor for 24 years in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>. `` I just love aviation so much that I could not resist a bet proposed to me by some friends,'' he said in his own defense. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamponi </PERSON>, president of the court, responded: `` <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON>, do you believe that a 52-year-old man should behave like a man of 20 and not resist a bet of this type?'' <PERSON> Lienart </PERSON> compared his client's stunt to Grand Prix driver <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Prost </PERSON> racing on an empty public street, saying: `` It was a violation of the rules, but it was not a danger.'' <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> said he had made contingency plans in the event of trouble during the flight that included landing his rented <ORGANIZATION> Rallye </ORGANIZATION> MS 880 Morane-Saulnier aircraft on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He told the court he was sorry and promised never again to perform such a stunt. The Air and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> arrested Maltret Oct. 13 shortly after his afternoon landing at a private airfield in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyr </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lienart </PERSON> argued that his client should not be punished for the publicity surrounding the unexplained summer flights. He pointed out that <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> flew during daylight hours in an identifiable plane, `` while the Black Baron is night, discretion, mystery.'' The summer flights captured the imagination of the French public and the media dubbed the pilot the `` Black Baron'' in a twist on the nickname of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s World War I flying ace, the Red Baron. On the night of Aug. 13, police helicopters chased the plane but were unable to catch it. <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> said he was proud of his 1986 escapade in which he landed his small plane on `` the most beautiful boulevard in the world.'' <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> had his pilots license suspended for the Champs Elysees landing. An amnesty covering minor offenses, enacted this summer as is traditional after French presidential elections, had allowed <PERSON> Maltret </PERSON> to recover his license.

<TEXT>
 In the ashes of a lost Democratic presidential campaign, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> heads toward the next one strengthened by new rules and a new role. Next time, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will begin as the Democrat to beat _ which is what somebody almost certainly will do. The odds weigh heavily against the nomination of a black man in 1992, in a party that at times shrank from the word `` liberal'' during the campaign just ended. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he does n't fear that a liberal ca n't be elected. `` Reaching out, making room, that's liberalism. So the liberal tradition is a proud tradition,'' he said. `` I will not forsake it.'' There surely will be ample competition, with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> names like <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and more on the early list of possible entries for 1992. Even as Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> conceded his loss to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his supporters were chanting `` ninety-two, ninety-two.'' Whatever the field, the standing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won in 1988 and the rules concessions he gained from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the Democratic National Convention will make him more formidable next time. For a while, Republicans tried to bill him as a virtual third partner in the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. He was a major, nationally-televised performer at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is aware of the perils as well as its advantages of his enhanced political station. He's been talking with friends and advisers about the way to deal with both. The first step already has been taken. It was a late campaign sprint in behalf of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. With it, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> guarded against any finger-pointing suggesting that he'd done less than his best for the Democratic ticket. He said he'd put in more miles, registered more voters than anyone else in support of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. By election night his voice was hoarse and fading from the campaign strain as he said it was much too early to talk about 1992 politics. `` I have not yet made that decision, not even given it serious consideration,'' he said. That at least is the public posture. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said the new political season began on Wednesday, pointing to city elections in 1989, off-year elections in 1990, the census and congressional reapportionment in 1991. `` There's a lot to do, a lot of meaningful work, and I intend to be involved, right in the heart of it,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. That involvement flows inexorably toward a third quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s voter registration efforts for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket will pay him dividends, too. His political action committee, Keep Hope Alive, fits the same pattern. An initial test of his strength in party councils will come early next winter, when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> elects a new chairman, or extends the tenure of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who had planned to leave the post but may stay on temporarily for the sake of party peace. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager and a volunteer adviser to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, expects to seek the chairmanship. At least four other Democrats are prospective candidates. While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is n't saying so yet, he will be at work for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> allies were named to about a dozen at-large committee seats as part of a harmony pact with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. One of the new committeemen: <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. More important, delegate selection rules have been amended to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s potential advantage in 1992 In a convention peacemaking deal with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp agreed to rules that will award future nominating votes strictly on the basis of proportional representation of the popular vote. In simplest terms, that reduces the convention clout of officeholders and party leaders who are not pledged to a candidate in advance, tying the outcome more tightly than ever to the presidential primaries. Another step in that direction was a cut in the number of so-called super delegates, Democratic governors, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others who got nominating votes with no strings and no instructions. That bloc was cut to about 10 percent of the delegate total. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained that his delegate strength did not match his percentage of the primary and caucus vote. The new rules will change that _ unless the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> establishment wants to risk a major battle with the party's premier black leader by trying to amend them again. In kinder, gentler political times, the defeated nominee of a party was considered its titular leader until the next campaign, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday that he will `` provide whatever leadership I can'' in the interest of Democratic unity. But presidential campaigning has become all but permanent, and defeated candidates go offstage quickly. The new Democratic cast will be auditioning before long. And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be looking for a lead role. `` Our charge today is to learn well the lessons from this campaign and build upon it as the vision for the next campaign,'' he has said. Not lately. He made that observation last summer, at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention, before the general election campaign for the White House even began.

 The Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said today that a summit next year between the nations' leaders will not dramatically change Soviet-Chinese relations because they already are normal. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyanovsky </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Dec. 1 to set the stage for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have entered an important new phase in their relations,'' he said of the long-time adversaries. `` One can say ... that our relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are normal. So perhaps it would be more correct to speak not about normalization but about further development.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> split with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over ideological differences in 1960 and fought a brief border war with the Soviets in 1969. <PERSON> Troyanovsky </PERSON> echoed Chinese statements that the end of feuding between the two countries will not mean a return to the relationship of the 1950s, when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dominated the communist world. Soviet-Chinese trade and other non-official contacts have increased since the early 1980s, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says normal political ties depend on the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a reduction of Soviet troops on the Chinese border and an end to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, speaking to reporters today before departing for a trip to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said, `` If everything goes smoothly, it is likely that the summit will be held in the first half of next year.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, rarely travels abroad. <PERSON> Troyanovsky </PERSON> said they had not yet discussed the summit site. It will be the first China-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1959. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Troyanovsky </PERSON> said, agree on most international issues, voting the same way more than 80 percent of the time at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, far more often than <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do. <PERSON> Troyanovsky </PERSON> said economic reform being carried out in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` is one of the factors which has brought about an improvement in the climate of our two nations.'' <PERSON> Troyanovsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> regards <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a great power. `` We think <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a great role to play both in regional matters and world matters,'' he said.

 Shipyard workers who staged a one-day strike in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> can keep their jobs for now, the yard's management announced today. State-run media reported earlier that the strikers had been fired. In a statement, management of the Repair Shipyard said dismissals were unnecessary since strikers heeded an appeal Wednesday to leave the shipyard. It said management will consider the guilt of strike leaders later and take `` appropriate disciplinary decisions.'' The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday night the director of the shipyard had fired the instigators of the strike at the 4,500-worker yard. `` In view of the imprecise communique concerning the <ORGANIZATION> Gdansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> on Polish radio and TV, we would like to inform that at the appeal of the manager ... A small group of strikers left the enterprise and thus there was no need to submit disciplinary dismissals immediately,'' the statement said. The management statement, read by <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradowski </PERSON>, editor of the official shipyard newspaper, <PERSON> Ostrow </PERSON>, said all workers reporting for work today were allowed into the yard. Hundreds of mostly young workers at the Repair and Wisla yards went on strike Tuesday without the backing of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The workers were demanding that the government scrap its plan to begin shutting down the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> next month. They ended the strikes Wednesday after repeated appeals from <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and a threat of dismissals from management. In September, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> persuaded strikers to end <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in seven years in exchange for a government promise to hold talks on ending the country's economic and political crisis and reinstating Solidarity. But the talks have been repeatedly delayed, with each side refusing conditions set by the other. One Solidarity demand is that about 100 coal miners fired for striking in August be rehired. The Wisla and Repair shipyard workers went on strike on a day <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had said he might call a nationwide strike alert over the government's announced intention to close the 10,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Dec. 1. But no strike alert was issued, and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> later said shipyard managers told him that liquidation of the huge complex would take several years. Soon after hearing Wednesday of the end of the second strike, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> thanked the workers for heeding his request. He argued that striking was counterproductive just now and that attention should be focused on starting the blocked talks with Communist authorities. But he also said: `` We will fight for the shipyard sooner or later, and we will regain it.'' Solidarity was born at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> works as an electrician, in August 1980 during nationwide strikes. It was crushed 15 months later in a military crackdown. An undetermined number of workers gave up a strike Wednesday morning at <LOCATION> Wisla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION>, which makes yachts and small river craft, after being promised that those who took part in the strike would not be fired, the yard's strike leader <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanecki </PERSON> said. He said several hundred workers supported the strike. At the Repair Shipyard, 200 workers who rallied Wednesday morning ended their strike at around 1 p.m., one hour after management said they must leave or be fired, said <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamolak </PERSON>, one of the strike committee members. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> continues to face resistance from young workers who are impatient for the proposed talks with the government to begin. The talks have also stalled over <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s refusal to purge from Solidarity's proposed delegation two people the government has deemed extremist, longtime advisers <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the gruff former attorney general who went to prison for conspiring to cover up the Watergate scandal in his friend <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s White House, is dead at 75 after collapsing on a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> street. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was the highest ranking of the government officials who served time for the political scandal that brought about <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s resignation from the presidency in August 1974 `` I considered <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to be one of my few close personal friends,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wrote in his memoirs. `` I believed that I owed my election as president in 1968 largely to his strength as a counselor and his skill as a manager.'' An ambulance crew, alerted by a 10-year-old boy who was skateboarding, found <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> unconscious on a street in the <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in early evening Wednesday. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had suffered a heart attack. He stopped breathing as he was being taken to the hospital, and died despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was convicted on Jan. 1, 1975, of conspiring with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s chief lieutenants, chief of staff H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> and domestic counselor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, to cover up White House involvement in the Watergate affair, of the cover-up itself and of perjury. He fought the conviction in vain to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. All three were sentenced after a three-month trial to terms of 2 -LCB- - to-8 years There was testimony at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Watergate hearings, at the cover-up trial and in various published first-person accounts that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> twice rejected plans for spying on Democrats because they were too expensive but that he accepted a third, less expensive, version. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> always denied the allegation. But in a March 22, 1973, taped Oval Office conversation, <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> says he's sorry he sent those burglars in there'' to which <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> replied: `` That's right.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> chimed in at that point and said `` You are very welcome, sir,'' and the transcript shows laughter. The tapes also showed that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> once wanted <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to take the rap for the entire Watergate cover-up. But <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> never said a harsh word about his former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law partner and would not permit his defense lawyer to do so. By all accounts they remained friends. `` He was very loyal to the president and the president was not very loyal to him,'' the late Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ervin </PERSON>, who presided over the Watergate hearings in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, once said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was the first former attorney general to be convicted of a crime. He was disbarred and served a 19-month prison term, which included five months of medical furloughs. When he was done with prison number 24171-157 at the minimum-security facility at <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, he told reporters, `` Henceforth, do n't call me. I'll call you.'' After his release, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> went into the international consulting business with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s chief aide in the early post-presidential years at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I never heard him be really cross about any of the things that happened to him or any of the people who had hurt him, intentionally or not,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` He has been, even at my age, my inspiration and has taught me how to forgive, how to be caring and how not to hold grudges.'' As attorney general, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was known for his credo that `` when the going gets tough, the tough get going.'' And in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> testimony he referred to Watergate as `` White House horrors.'' The former attorney general's second wife, the flamboyant and peppery <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, gained a measure of fame for her late-night telephone calls to reporters in which she offered shrill, shoot-from-the-hip opinions on controversial issues of all sorts, including her husband's problems. She called reporters in 1973 to announce that she and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had split up. After he was sentenced for conspiracy, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said: `` It could have been a hell of a lot worse. They could have sentenced me to spend the rest of my life with <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> died alone in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital on May 31, 1976, after suffering from cancer of the bone marrow. The two had one daughter, <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had a son and daughter from his first marriage and there are five grandchildren. The son, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, died several years ago. In recent years, the former attorney general had a relationship with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> socialite <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the two were not married. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> paid his way through <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> by playing hockey for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. He was highly decorated in World War II, receiving two purple hearts, and commanded the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PT </ORGANIZATION> boat unit in which <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> served. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> issued a statement saying they were saddened by the death. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> re-election committee official who served eight months in prison for Watergate crimes, recalled <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> as `` a great mentor and friend of mine and I just loved that man.'' <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, interviewed today on `` CBS This Morning,'' called <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> `` the most level-headed and positive person in the administration at that level.'' He said he never knew <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to utter a word against <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> after the Watergate scandal brought down his administration. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, the chief counsel in the Watergate coverup trial, called <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> `` an easy man to know and associate with.'' `` He committed offenses, and I prosecuted him,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said, but he added, `` There never was any bitterness.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was a municipal bond specialist and senior partner in <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s old <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> law firm when he became chairman of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s 1968 election campaign He resigned as attorney general to run <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s re-election campaign in 1972, but quit that post as the Watergate scandal began unfolding. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s release from prison was considered the final page in the long Watergate saga. `` Watergate is now a closed issue,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> at the time.

<HEAD>Eight Reported Killed in Brazilian Steelworkers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers and police opened fire on thousands of striking workers at <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest steel mill, and a plant official said today that eight people were killed. The confrontation occurred Wednesday night inside the huge state-owned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Volta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Redonda </LOCATION>, 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. Army soldiers occupied the plant Tuesday night after 18,000 steelworkers went on strike demanding higher pay and shorter working hours. The soldiers kept the blast furnaces running, and tanks were stationed in front of the plant's gates to maintain order. On Wednesday, 800 soldiers and police officers tried to disperse a crowd of 3,000 strikers armed with rocks and iron bars who refused to leave the plant. The troops, who were pelted with stones, fired on the protesters with tear gas and rifles, said the mill's press official who demanded anonymity. `` We could hear the shots and explosions. We know eight people were killed and lots were injured, but no one wants to say how they died,'' said the press official at the plant in a telephone interview. She said at least two of the victims were steelworkers, but the others were not immediately identified. An officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 22nd Motorized Infantry Batallion confirmed some strikers died from gunshots. `` Some were shot by soldiers,'' said the officer, who gave his name only as Capt. <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The strikers are demanding a reduction of their work day from eight to six hours and reinstatement of the cost-of-living adjustments the government suspended. The average salary of a steelworker at the <LOCATION> Volta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Redonda </LOCATION> plant is $ 160 a month, and the strikers are demanding a 25 percent monthly increase that would be retroactive 15 months. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate is more than 1,000 percent. Strike leaders said they will not negotiate and were awaiting a ruling on their demands by a court. T he strike has crippled the mill's daily output of 26 tons of steel, costing the government $ 5 million a day in lost revenue, the press official said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> produces 4 million tons of steel annually, nearly one-fifth of the nation's total output. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest steel producer and ranked seventh worldwide.

 Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said today that all foreign military aid to the warring factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> should end after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from that Southeast Asian nation. `` Following the complete withdrawal, military assistance from foreign countries to all parties in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> ought to cease,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the key military supplier of a resistance coalition fighting the Vietnamese and the Hanoi-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> must face hard facts and make a solid decision on how to reconcile with the involved -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- parties on trying to end that conflict,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said in a statement shortly after his arrival. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> called the decade-long occupation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> a `` tinderbox'' and said: `` There is widespread agreement to eliminate this tinderbox swiftly.'' In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told reporters before leaving that `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> share similar points of view on a political settlement of the Kampuchean -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- question. So we would like to exchange points of views.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> today on his first trip outside the country since taking office in April. He was to discuss the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue with Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> and other Thai leaders during a five-day visit that began with a private audience with King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>, the country's powerful constitutional monarch. In his statement, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to expand trade and investment with Asian and Pacific nations to help sustain the region's rapid economic growth. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> also pressed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to make a `` solid decision'' on ending the 10-year war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in late 1978. As key supporters of the anti-Vietnamese forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> are expected to coordinate views on how to end the war. Asked in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s military aid to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of the three resistance armies, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supports all three factions and `` our only purpose for this kind of assistance to the <LOCATION> Kampuchean </LOCATION> resistance forces is to fight against the Vietnamese invaders.'' He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decision to stop arming the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` is totally dependent on when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> have recently been accused of using <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> weapons in attacks on forces of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION>, leaders of the other two anti-Vietnamese factions.

 Two officials of a closed credit-repair company have agreed to a settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> banning them from claiming that they can improve people's credit ratings. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, president, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Credit-Rite </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, signed the consent agreement announced Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Credit-Rite, headquartered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, operated 29 credit-repair franchises in 13 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> before closing its doors last year. The company charged consumers between $ 500 and $ 700 for its services and was one of the nation's largest credit-repair companies The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had charged that the company falsely claimed to be able to improve credit ratings and then failed to honor its money-back guarantee when it was unable to do so. In addition to prohibiting the Grays from making false claims in future, the consent order requires them to give any future client notice stating that they have no legal right to get any correct information removed from their credit record.

 An explosion and fire at an oil refinery killed 17 people, and the blaze burned through the night and into today, officials said. A company spokesman said sabotage was not ruled out as the cause. Doctors said nine people died today in hospitals and that 13 people were in critical condition with burns. Firefighters battled the blaze at the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Bharat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroelum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd.. Refinery in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>'s suburb throughout the night, <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>, director of the refinery division, said. The fire was still burning in one of the tanks containing highly flammable naphtha today, but <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON> said the blaze was under control. Two huge tanks of naphtha burst into flames after an explosion at the refinery on Wednesday. Eight people died immediately. Three nearby tanks were emptied in an effort to keep the fire from spreading to more than 300 others in the 430-acre refinery on the northeast edge of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. `` There was a small explosion followed by a fire,'' said <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>. `` A tank ca n't explode by itself. We are not ruling out sabotage.'' <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON> said the blast and fire blew off the roof of a tank containing 250 tons of naphtha and a nearby tank containing 150 tons of naphtha soon caught fire. The clouds of black smoke could be seen 12 miles away. Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the explosion may have occurred in an adjacent dispatch unit where four trucks were reduced to blackened pieces of metal. The trucks had been loaded with drums of bitumen manufactured at the plant. `` All I heard was a big bang. By the time I turned around to see what was happening, my shirt was on fire,'' trucker <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Majique </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency.

 Of all the men who worked for President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, none was closer than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. And none, perhaps, was as deeply involved in the Watergate scandal. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was finishing out his days as attorney general in early 1972 when a former assistant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, brought former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> man <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON> to see him. <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON>, then working for the re-election committee, had a plan for conducting political espionage on the Democrats. As he outlined it, it involved the use of burglaries and prostitutes and would cost $ 1 million. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> later testified he rejected the plan out of hand. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> brought <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON> back a second time with a scaled down plan that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also rejected even though the cost was only a half million. A third plan was submitted in writing and while <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> steadfastly denied approving it, by all other accounts he gave his OK. He was indicted and tried along with two other top <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> aides, chief of staff H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> and domestic counselor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Erhlichman </PERSON>, on charges they had tried to conceal the identifies of the people involved in the burglary of Democratic party headquarters that resulted from the <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON> plan. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was convicted of conspiring to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice, lying to a grand jury, and perjury. A charge of lying to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was dismissed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirica </PERSON>. He served 19 months in a federal prison, but five months of it was spent outside while he underwent hip and artery surgery. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> re-election committee official who served eight months in prison for Watergate crimes, said today he believed that White House paranoia drew <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and others into the Watergate scandal. `` I do n't think <PERSON> John </PERSON> was interested at all in becoming involved in what became known as Watergate, but the pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was very tough to deal with,'' he said in an interview on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` We all came to the White House wanting to serve <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, and we tried to serve him well, and I'm afraid when it got to that point there was a willingness to cover up, obstruction of justice, which of course was wrong in retrospect,'' <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON> said.

 Police today prevented three American Jewish activists from entering President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s office to deliver a letter calling for his resignation. Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> wore yellow Stars of <PERSON> David </PERSON> and the striped garb of Nazi concentration camp inmates. The three are from the New York-based Coalition of Concern and are in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes and businesses and beat Jews. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has been accused by Jewish groups of taking part in atrocities when he served in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> for the German army during World War II. The president denies the allegations. `` <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s election is a legitimation of the crimes of the Holocaust,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said, standing under the <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> palace balcony where <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> addressed crowds after the March 1938 annexation of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

As the three began to walk, a policeman told them in English they could not continue what he termed their `` demonstration.'' In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, a demonstration must be registered with police 24 hours in advance. Nine uniformed police surrounded the trio and refused to let them move on. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> ended the protest, which attracted little attention from passers-by.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> has approved an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plan to detonate explosives equal to 250 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> to test a new type of munitions storage shed. The blast _ equivalent to about one-eightieth of the explosive force of the atomic bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> in 1945 _ tentatively is scheduled for Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Test and Training Range, 70 miles from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The test is intended to determine how far apart the storage sheds must be to prevent an explosion in one from detonating explosives in others. <PERSON> Burnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordner </PERSON>, director of the air quality bureau, said the blast would create no significant air pollution problems, and he issued the necessary permit. Among the conditions set by the bureau were a requirement that the wind not be blowing toward populated areas and that there be no temperature inversion, which could trap the blast force near the ground. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said that in an `` absolutely worst-case scenario,'' the blast could break windows on the <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Front </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> are situated, but that can be avoided by detonating in proper weather. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> of Downwinders, a watchdog group, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has not properly investigated the geology in the area. He said the soil might be softer than expected and capable of producing large, destructive shock waves. `` If their calculations are correct and everything is done properly under right conditions, and if there is no subsurface problem, then probably this will go off without any significant environmental, human health or economic damage,'' he said. `` However, if it occurs at the wrong time, or if there are subsurface problems, it could cause real problems.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today they have resumed full diplomatic relations, ending a 17-month break in ties caused in part by the arrest of an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges. Today's announcement followed talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> between Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s assistant under secretary of state for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, and Dr. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaezi </PERSON>, director general of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` have decided to resume full diplomatic representation with immediate effect based on reciprocity, mutual respect and non-interference in each others' affairs,'' said a Foreign Office statement. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said a statement and memorandum of understanding were signed at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s mission in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> after a nine-hour session that ended early this morning. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> traveled to the Austrian capital Wednesday for the third round of negotiations since August. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Basti </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s lone diplomat in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> throughout the diplomatic freeze, hinted that the resumption of ties could speed the release of Britons held hostage by pro-Iranian Islamic militants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Questioned on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio, <PERSON> Basti </PERSON> said the hostage issue had not arisen in the negotiations, but added: `` If you are trying to imply that the new relationship between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> may contribute to that end, I'm not going to deny that.'' Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, whose envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in January 1987 while trying to help free the hostages, was also asked whether renewed ties would help the hostages. `` Certainly this can not do any harm,'' he said. `` We must wait and see. This is welcome news. After all, the purpose of this diplomacy is to make it easy for governments to talk to each other.'' Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the hostages' plight was not included in the discussions. `` There's no bargain or secret agenda,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, but he added that the thaw enabled <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` more effectively to press the case at every opportunity for the Iranians to use all the influence they have got to secure the release of hostages. Diplomatic relations were curtailed in June 1987 after an Iranian diplomat was arrested on shoplifting charges in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and militants kidnapped and beat up a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> withdrew its diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, closed the Iranian consulate in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and reduced the number of Iranian staff at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> embassy to one. Since then, British interests in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been looked after by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. A diplomatic source in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in each country to assume posts over the next several months. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would have a charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> within a few weeks, and an exchange of ambassadors `` within hopefully six months of that.'' Besides <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is seeking the release of journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says it also seeks word on <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him.

But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also said there is no chance the two nations will reach a comprehensive peace settlement unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> recognizes the border between the nations as it was set under a 1975 treaty. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also said Wednesday night he sees no prospects so far for improving ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will continue efforts to obtain the release of hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> although `` our possibilities are limited.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to a proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to exchange 1,569 sick and wounded POWs. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> sai `` this may create a better atmosphere'' at the talks and may `` make them more active.'' He again said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> considers this exchange to be independent of the talks, which are aimed making permanent the cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20. Repatriation of another 100,000 prisoners must be linked to other points in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution that both sides have endorsed, he said. He said the highest priority in the resolution is the provision calling for both sides to withdraw troops to `` internationally recognized boundaries.'' The dispute over the border has stalled the talks since they began Aug. 25, because <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> repudiated a 1975 treaty with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that defined the border. `` International law confirms our position that the treaty remains valid,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. `` When you say that the first step should be the withdrawal to internationally recognized borders, where is that border if you do not have a valid treaty?'' Commenting on the issue of hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s efforts have helped free `` many people, including Americans, Germans, regardless of their nationality.'' `` We continue our humanitarian efforts to get these hostages released. But we really do n't know the destiny of these people in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and which group has which hostages. We have some spiritual relations with the Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But our possibilities are limited.''

 Opposition lawmakers walked out of a Crystal Night ceremony today after claiming a speech by the parliament president failed to express proper grief for Nazi crimes against Jews. The 26-page speech by President <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> made some listeners cry but drew angry criticism from other members of parliament, who said <PERSON> Jenniger </PERSON> recounted Nazi atrocities in an inappropriately cool and dispassionate manner. `` He marched through history with the intellect of combat boots,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON>, a parliament member of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The controversy marred a session marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the first night of organized Nazi terror against the Jews. The ceremony featured an emotional appearance by <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>, an 88-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor who read from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Celan </PERSON>'s poem `` Todesfuge.'' `` Death is a master from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, his eye is blue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>, a well-known actress and director in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, read from the famous work. `` He strikes thee with leaden bullets, he strikes thee exactly.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>, dressed in black with a white blouse, spoke before parliament and invited guests, including West German Jewish leader <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>. During the Third Reich, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> barred the Jewish actress from working and eventually sent her to a concentration camp for several years. Later during today's session, Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON> put her hands on her forehead and began crying as <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> began reading an eyewitness account of the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942. `` Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' the 56-year-old Jenninger read. `` Some of those shot were still moving, some lifted their arms and turned their heads, to show they were still alive.'' As he read, some of the lawmakers in the audience appeared on the verge of tears, and federal President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> at one point buried his head in his hand. But some opposition lawmakers said other portions of <PERSON> Jenniger </PERSON>'s lacked a feeling of atonement for what happened to the Jews during the Holocaust, and demanded he resign as a parliament president <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> party members left the hall to protest the speech, which was part of the hour-long service televised live nationwide. `` I do n't agree with this speech, but I will express my criticism within the party,'' said <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerster </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> `` spoke of Germans and foreign Jews instead of Jewish Germans.'' <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> for using expressions such as `` Arianization of property,'' without sufficient explanation of its ruthless meaning during the Third Reich. He also criticized <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> for not using the expression, `` German Jews,'' when talking about the victims of the Nazi terror. Social Democrat and <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> members criticized <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> for presenting the speech `` in a dry emotionless way,'' and for `` not clearly expressing repulsion at what the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> did.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have held observances this week as a reminder of the death and destruction begun during Kristallnacht and carried on throughout the Holocaust. On the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> thugs ransacked 7,500 Jewish businesses, destroyed thousands of Jewish homes and sent 30,000 Jews to concentration camps. Ninety-one Jews were killed and 267 synagogues destroyed. The rampage coordinated by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s henchmen left city streets littered with glass _ hence the name Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass. Historians say Kristallnacht was the start of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' campaign to wipe out European Jews, a campaign that eventually claimed 6 million Jewish lives. There are about 32,000 Jews in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The government used a surprise vote to ram controversial tax-reform bills through a parliamentary committee today, and police had to be summoned to control screaming opposition members. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a commanding majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION> and in parliament, approved the bills, which would result in the first sweeping overhaul of the country's tax system in 40 years. Opposition legislators, who had boycotted the committee session, rushed into the chamber after the chairman suddenly called for a vote. They screamed `` tyrant'' and `` disgrace,'' but about 50 policemen surrounded the chairman's desk and blocked them from interfering with the vote. `` We are sorry that we finally could not reach agreement with opposition parties,'' <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, the governing party secretary general, said later. `` But we had to pass the bills because we are running out of time.'' The Liberal Democrats could have forced the bills through from the start, but such a tactic is rare and against the Japanese parliamentary tradition of seeking consensus and compromise, even if only in making small changes to let the opposition save face. The public is thought to regard forceful tactics as signs of arrogance or undemocratic tendencies, which can cost a party votes. Opposition leaders reacted fiercely to the unexpected vote. `` It was an act of tyranny,'' said <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary general of the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Passage of such important legislation without the approval of the people and opposition party not only neglects the people's interest, but also indicates the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s intention to conceal scandal.'' The opposition boycotted the committee session to try to force the government to disclose more information about the so-called Recruit scandal, which involves scores of top politicians, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>. The scandal began in July with revelations that the politicians or their aides profited from selling unlisted shares they acquired in the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a big conglomerate. By boycotting parliamentary sessions, the opposition sought to link progress on the tax-reform bills with further revelations that would damage the Liberal Democrats.

 A Liberian oil tanker broke in half in stormy weather in the north <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> today, burst into flames and began to sink, spreading fire over the ocean and leaving the 27 crewmen missing, coast guard officials said. A Canadian military aircraft flew over the scene nine hours after the tanker sent a distress signal, and it spotted two empty life rafts, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Search </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. `` We have not found any survivors,'' <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> said. Earlier, the Soviet ship Passat rushed from 26 miles away to help the 65,700-ton Odyssey but was unable to get closer than a mile to the stricken vessel because of the fire, authorities said. The Passat, which monitors weather on the ocean, told rescue officials it found no sign of the Greek and Honduran crew and was searching the area, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It does n't sound very good at all,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` The Soviet vessel has lost radio contact with the tanker.'' <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> said the fire was mostly out. The stern of the ship sank and only the bow was afloat, and a large oil slick coated the ocean surface, he said. He said a bulk carrier and another Canadian aircraft were en route to the scene. Capt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> of the Canadian rescue center said the tanker was about 700 miles east-northeast of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. British officials said it was about 1,200 miles west of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Polembros </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, operators of the Odyssey, said half the crew was Greek, including the captain and all the officers, and the other half was Honduran. `` We have n't heard any news at all about them,'' said a spokeswoman, commenting on condition she was not identified. She said the tanker is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the tanker was 52 degrees 38 minutes north latitude and 34 degrees 39 minutes west longitiude, or near the center of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The Odyssey, built in 1971, sent a distress signal at 3:22 a.m. saying it needed immediate assistance, the <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION> spokesman said. The signal was picked up by <ORGANIZATION> Valentia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and relayed to British coast guard officials, he said. The British alerted the Passat, one of several Soviet weather ships that operate in that sector of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The tanker is in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> sector of responsibility covered by the Canadians, and the emergency operation was being coordinated in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> with assistance from British coast guard officials. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Valentia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that the Odyssey left Sullom Voe, a Scottish oil terminal, on Nov. 5 and was heading for the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> port of Come By Chance. Canadian <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON> said the weather at the tanker site was stormy, with 46 mph westerly winds and 25-foot waves.

 The sole supplier of rayon yarn used in the space shuttle and military rockets reopened today as abruptly as it closed a week ago.

The reopening of the 1,300-employee plant took <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and other officials by surprise. The space agency had held discussions with the company in an effort to ensure continued manufacture of the rayon used in rocket nozzles. `` I was not aware of that,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Medal </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` To my knowledge, there has not been a formalized agreement realized.'' In a statement Wednesday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said the company was `` able to negotiate a long-term contract with certain aerospace industry companies that will allow <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibers-Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> to return to full production of its fiber products.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> won the contract with `` the encouragement'' of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

The announcement sent <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and several government contractors scrambling to figure out what the impact would be on the space shuttle program and other projects that depend on a carbonizable rayon fiber. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said it has enough of the material on hand for another 10 shuttle flights. The fiber is used in engine nozzles of the shuttle and a variety of defense missiles.

 A jury today acquitted a man of sexually molesting his 5 -LCB- - year-old daughter in a case that drew national attention when the girl's mother went to jail rather than let her husband see the child After about three hours of deliberation, a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found 33-year-old <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION> not guilty.

Defense attorney <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> disputed the testimony of a child psychiatrist and a pediatrician, arguing the child was influenced by her mother and learned through repeated interrogations by her to describe the alleged abuse. `` Do you think she learned the story?'' he asked during closing arguments. `` Do you think she got a feel for what it is that mommy is looking for?'' He said the girl had been psychologically abused by her mother, her father and the system, but not sexually abused by her father. `` She has been bounced off everyone you can think of as it relates to psychological abuse,'' he said. County Attorney <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> argued that the girl had engaged in adult sexual behavior unusual and inappropriate for children her age, and that it must have been shown to her. `` The girl was her own best spokesperson when she said that daddy touched her,'' he said. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> also disputed defense contention that Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>'s behavior marked her as an obsessive paranoid `` What is the standard of a mother who thinks her child has been sexually abused?'' he asked. `` Frantic probably does n't describe it.'' `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> was motivated solely to defend her child and she did it every way she knew how,'' he said. `` Within that context, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> makes more sense than anybody we've heard from.''

<TEXT>
 A report released today blamed lax safety standards for a subway fire that killed 31 people last year. Hours before the government study was issued, the two top men running <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s subway system resigned. The report said subway management `` did not guard against the unpredictability of fire'' and that staff response to the Nov. 18 blaze was `` uncoordinated, haphazard and untrained.'' Dr. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground, announced his resignation this morning. Sir <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, the controlling body, quit Wednesday night. Bright had been chairman and chief executive of the transport agency since 1982. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> presented the report to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on the government-ordered inquiry into the fire at King's Cross station, the subway system's busiest station. During the 91-day inquiry, the board was criticized over safety standards and Bright was criticized for appearing to promote the theory that the fire was started by an arsonist. Police and forensic scientists said they believed the fire was started by a lighted match or cigarette dropped by a smoker onto a wooden escalator, which ignited grease-soaked trash underneath. Flames raced up the escalator into the ticket lobby. Following the blaze, smoking was banned throughout the subway. In the report, attorney <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> made 157 recommendations to improve the subway, urging it to `` institute a managed safety program.'' He said nobody had overall responsibility for safety at the time of the fire. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> called the subway `` one of the safest forms of transport'' and criticized the 250-page report as an `` emotive document.'' In June, <PERSON> Bright </PERSON> told the <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> inquiry that he had he offered to resign immediately after the fire but agreed to stay on at <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>'s request. Bright said in a statement Wednesday night that he has since `` devoted most of my energy ... to seeking to ensure that the lessons of King's Cross have been ... learned and that actions necessary to avoid a recurrence ... should be vigorously pressed ahead.'' He said he felt he had accomplished that task and, with the impending release of the report, it was time to resign. Earlier this year, the board undertook more than 100 improvements, including the removal of wooden panels from escalators, staff retraining and reinforcement of liaison procedures with emergency services. Lawyer <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who represents most of the families of the victims, said of Bright's resignation: `` The decision will come as a relief to many of the relatives of victims who feel very strongly that <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> was very much to blame for the tragedy.'' Legislator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman, said: `` It is inevitable that Bright should resign in view of the total failure of management to give proper safety.'' Before the fire, only one person had died in a blaze on the subway, in 1985. But fires are regularly reported on the crowded, 125-year-old system, parts of which badly need modernizing. A safety report two years before the King's Cross fire said there were 10 serious fires in the system between 1976 and 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authorities </ORGANIZATION>, representing <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> boroughs controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said subway safety had deteriorated since the King's Cross fire. It said there were 21 serious fires on the subway in the first six months of this year compared to 10 in all of 1987. A serious fire is defined as one that stops trains for more than 30 minutes. The subway carries 750 million passengers a year. More than 200,000 a day board or leave trains at King's Cross station, a multi-level complex that is a terminus for commuter rail lines. In the worst post-war accident on the subway, 43 people died and 74 were hurt when a train crashed at <LOCATION> Moorgate </LOCATION> station in the business district in 1975.

<HEAD>Students Clamor to Hear Popular Chinese Dissident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous dissident gave a rare public lecture to a standing-room-only crowd of students at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, telling them he believes `` demonstrations are quite beautiful.'' More than 600 students packed a small lecture hall and the adjoining hallway Wednesday night to hear <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>'s lecture on `` Physics and Beauty,'' the astrophysicist's first public speech on the campus since May. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> joked freely about government claims he helped inspire pro-democracy student demonstrations two years ago, which led to his expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think demonstrations are quite beautiful,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said pointing to a cartoon of banner-waving demonstrators that he said illustrated his concept of beauty: the unity of chaos and order. `` Unfortunately,'' he said, `` some people do n't appreciate this kind of beauty.'' Thousands of students at colleges in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and other major cities took to the streets in the winter of 1986-87 to press demands for democracy. The protests ended with harsh warnings from the government and the ouster of party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> for failing to crack down on the demonstrators. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was forced to resign as vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and expelled from the party. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> noted the students were criticized for lacking a well-defined program to back up their pro-democracy slogans, but he praised them for having started people thinking. `` The slogans were correct,'' he said. `` Over the past two years, people have been in the process of developing the arguments and reasoning to support them.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> reiterated his views on the need for greater freedom for Chinese reporters, publishers and researchers. He cited difficulties with getting his own books published as evidence that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not have a free press. Student organizers of the lecture said they announced the lecture only two hours in advance to avoid attracting attention from school authorities, and the large turnout on such short notice indicated <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s popularity. The audience frequently broke into applause throughout the lecture, usually in response to <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s subtle political humor. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said campus authorities approved the student-organized lecture series of which his talk was a part, but had not given specific permission for him to speak. `` I do n't think there will be any problems,'' he said. `` I only implied a lot of things, I did n't say anything directly.

 Farmers are expected to gain more than 7,000 acres of arable land when authorities remove an electronic alarm system along the border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Thursday. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, minister of state and a member of the Politburo, said last month the alarm system had become outdated `` historically, politically and technically.'' Hungarians have been allowed to travel to the West more freely after laws were enacted at the beginning of this year allowing an unlimited number of exits to passport holders. The agency said the removal of the alarm system was expected to yield about 7,410 acres of land to cooperative farms near the western town of <LOCATION> Koszeg </LOCATION>.

 A bomb planted outside a judicial office building was discovered and defused minutes before it was to explode, authorities said Thursday. Police said the bomb, consisting of 35 pounds of dynamite and 11 pounds of nitroglycerin, could have brought down the building, which houses the offices of magistrates. The burning fuse was spotted and extinguished late Wednesday night by a police patrol, and bomb experts were called in to defuse the device. Police said they suspected the bomb was planted by the Mafia in an attempt to intimidate investigating magistrates. <PERSON> Gela </PERSON>, a town of 80,000 people on <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s southern coast, has been plagued by a war between rival <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> clans that has claimed 23 lives this year, including the slaying of a 17-year-old boy Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 A flock of ravens flew into homes and attacked people in a neighborhood outside <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in what one resident said Thursday looked like a scene from <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s horror movie `` The Birds.'' Police shot and killed one of the large black birds after several residents of <LOCATION> Yahud </LOCATION>, a town about six miles east of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, complained that about 20 ravens had perched on nearby trees and were harassing residents, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. Two people suffered scratches in the attacks before police killed the most aggressive bird Wednesday night, the radio said. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published a picture of a policeman holding the dead raven, which had a wing span of about three feet. `` This raven was evil. It had frightening black eyes, large wings and a large beak,'' Yahud resident <PERSON> Pazit </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Another woman said the ravens had been a problem in the neighborhood for more than a month. `` The birds would fly around the houses and bother us when we were sleeping,'' said the woman, who was not identified. `` For two weeks we have been sleeping with closed shutters and closed windows.'' `` It was just like the movie by <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>. Whenever we opened our windows, the birds would arrive,'' she told the radio. A police spokesman said the neighborhood was quiet Thursday and troopers had decided against asking a special Air force unit to help them chase away the ravens. <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankenberg </PERSON>, coordinator for wild animal protection at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not expect the birds to continue harassing the neighborhood. `` Ravens are very smart,'' <PERSON> Frankenberg </PERSON> said. `` If one of them is killed, the others will quickly learn not to attack.'' He said ravens usually do not bother humans unless the birds are defending their territory. The birds are not prone to attack and should not be considered a threat, he added. `` Something like this happens from time to time, but it is very unusual,'' <PERSON> Frankenberg </PERSON> said. `` The birds may try to peck someone on the head a little bit, but I would n't call it an attack.''

<TEXT>
 Scientists probing the sea floor off the coast of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have discovered a new field of hot springs, mineral deposits and exotic animal life, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. The area, as long as five city blocks, offers a new frontier for scientific exploration, according to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rona </PERSON>, chief scientist for the team. <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> has led <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s deep-sea explorations in both the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> oceans in recent years, discovering a variety of volcanic hot springs in both oceans as well as exotic tube worms and other life forms. The new finds were made along an underwater mountain range called the <LOCATION> Gorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, about 100 miles off the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> coast. The scientists went as deep as 10,000 feet using a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> deep submergence vehicle. The finding will allow scientists `` to study first-hand how sea-floor hot springs form metallic mineral deposits, support exotic forms of life and influence the ocean environment,'' <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> said. Water temperatures in the hot springs were measured as high as 500 degrees Fahrenheit. <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> said that in the area large plates in the Earth's crust are being pulled and cracked, allowing sea water to contact with volcanic rocks. The heated water leaches metals from the rock and deposits them on the sea floor. Thickets of tube worms several feet high, topped with bright red plumes, are growing around the hot springs, the scientists said. In addition they found crabs, octopuses, deep-sea fish and other life forms. These deep-water vents in the sea floor were only discovered a few years ago when <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> and other scientists began investigating the waters around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proclaimed an Exclusive Economic Zone offshore. The vents have been found in the Gorda and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON> ridges off the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> coast and also far out in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Rona </PERSON>, participants in the <LOCATION> Gorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> dives included scientists from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey, <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geology </ORGANIZATION> and Mineral Resources, and the universities of California-Davis and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today pleaded guilty to mischarging the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on a $ 9.2 million contract and agreed to pay $ 810,600 in fines and other penalties. The $ 810,600 include $ 250,000 in criminal penalties and $ 250,000 in civil restitution. The company, based in <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to three felony false-claims charges that it misallocated labor charges totaling $ 250,000 in 1985, 1986 and 1987 in fulfilling a computer software support contract. The contract was between <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a predecessor of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The improper activities involved shifting charges between contracts and occurred at <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> office, the company acknowledged. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilby </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has determined that <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is a responsible contractor and will not be barred from holding government contracts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> cooperated in the investigation and, in fact, alerted <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigators to the last $ 150,000 of the total $ 250,000 in misallocations. <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said the $ 810,600 owed by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was significantly more than the profit <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> earned on the project. The five-year contract, which expired in September 1987, involved computer hardware and software development and support, said spokesman <PERSON> Wren </PERSON> <PERSON> Timberlake </PERSON>. In August, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said it outlined its intention to plead guilty in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> requires companies to describe any corporate actions that might affect stockholders. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> totaling $ 80 million, <PERSON> Timberlake </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Folks selling goods at craft fairs will find life a little easier under a change in federal consumer-protection rules announced Thursday. The change in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations will exempt arts and crafts sellers, and also sellers of automobiles at public auctions and tent sales, from having to give buyers a three-day cooling-off period. FTC rules in effect since 1972 have required that people selling items costing $ 25 or more, and making the sale somewhere other than their normal place of business, give buyers three days to change their minds, and provide a notice of cancellation for the consumer to use if necessary. That regulation was intended to protect buyers who succumb to high-pressure tactics on the part of door-to-door sales people. The commission said it decided to give an exemption to people who sell arts and cfafts items at fairs because those sales do not appear to present a threat of deceptive practices. The exemption for auto sales at auctions and tent sales applies as long as the seller has a permanent place of business where a consumer can go to complain should a problem arise with the purchase.

 Economic worries kept the financial markets from celebrating <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decisive victory over <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, even though traders had anticipated and welcomed another Republican in the White House. The dollar dropped sharply against most major currencies Wednesday after rallying briefly in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and prices for stocks and bonds followed suit. It ended lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today and continued to fall elsewhere. `` The markets had already discounted a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory after the second -LRB- presidential -RRB- debate ... but a lot of uncertainty remains about key economic problems,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International A key issue, economists say, is whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can work together to trim the budget and trade deficits inherited from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I look at it as basic economic reality versus political constraints,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said there would be no tax increase ... so that will mean budget cuts. The impasse will be over where to cut.'' On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lead a broad market decline Wednesday, dropping 9.25 to 2,118.24 despite recovering some lost ground in the final 90 minutes of trading. The closely watched index advanced 2.85 points on Election Day. By midday today, stock prices turned mixed. The Dow Jones average was down 0.89 points at 2,117.35 at noon EST. Interest rates moved up as bond prices declined Wednesday. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue hovered around 9 percent for the first time in more than a month, while its price fell about $ 5 per $ 1,000 face amount. Short-term rates also rose slightly. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that a weak dollar in foreign exchange also helped drag down stock and bond prices. Other factors affecting the markets, he said, included this week's $ 30 billion quarterly <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auction and concerns over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be quietly tightening credit. `` It's hard to disentangle all those things,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar initially rallied overseas after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory, but reversed course later in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, largely on profit-taking and investor nervousness. It continued weakening in domestic trading despite reports of central bank intervention. The dollar dropped to three-month lows against the West German mark, the British pound and the Dutch guilder in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and to a five-month low against the Japanese yen. The dollar selloff intensified following comments from <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, former head of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> and an adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency should drop at least 20 percent in the value during the next three years to help reduce the trade gap. A cheaper dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports more attractive in foreign markets. Apprehension about the economy under a new administration also was shared in some overseas stock markets. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 46.36 points today, to close at 28,166.42. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 14.9 points to close at 1,825.7. Stock and bond prices had edged higher and the dollar rose against major foreign currencies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday, partly because of confidence <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would defeat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and continue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's economic policies.

Traffic on the busy interstate was rerouted around the interchange for four hours as six officers tried to prevent the birds from fleeing into an adjoining lane of the highway. Authorities were concerned the birds would run into traffic and cause another accident, but <PERSON> Dykeman </PERSON> said they huddled together to keep warm in temperatures in the mid-30s. The turkeys' moment of thanksgiving was short-lived, however. The 1,000 birds were bound for a processing plant in <LOCATION> Ellsworth </LOCATION> and workers loaded the last of the birds onto another truck, <PERSON> Dykeman </PERSON> said. About 300 turkeys were killed in the crash, in which the dirver was injured.

<HEAD>Owen County Advertises For Doctor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWENTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A huge, white banner stretches over Main Street downtown <PERSON> Owenton </PERSON>, bearing the uneasy message: `` <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> needs a doctor. Inquire at Courthouse.'' `` We need two or three doctors,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, 65, a retired state worker. `` But we need at least one awful bad.'' Rural areas across the country are desperate for doctors and are turning to desperate measures to recruit them. `` My thinking in putting it -LRB- banner -RRB- up was to let the community know that we are going to have a big problem in a few months,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a general practitioner who is planning to move from <LOCATION> Owenton </LOCATION> in March. The banner paid off with at least one inquiry: A doctor driving through town last week saw it and has begun talking with county officials, said county Judge-Executive <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> `` Doug'' West. But there's nothing definite yet, he added. <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is raising money and hopes to guarantee a first-year salary of $ 75,000 for a family doctor. In the past, the county has guaranteed wages, given free office space and paid the salaries of support personnel to woo doctors. But the county of 9,000 people has had trouble keeping young doctors in the area. `` A doctor fresh out of school wants to move closer to home,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. `` We're looking for a doctor who wants to make this his home.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 31, who moved here several years ago as part of a federal program now being phased out, wants to go home to his family in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He has said he will leave in March, giving officials some time to find a replacement. As of now, <PERSON> Owenton </PERSON> ranks 36th in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> in terms of need for a physician, said <PERSON> Danise </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, program administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Physician </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Robertson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is at the top of the list because it does n't have any doctors, Ms. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> is no different than many other states,'' Ms. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said. `` It has a problem finding physicians for rural areas. There is no magical way of doing it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said there were several reasons doctors are not choosing to practice in rural areas. Hospitals are small or non-existent and doctors experience professional isolation. Often, there is not another physician who will cover for them, so there is no time off. Most physicians do their residency in an urban area and do n't want to move to a small town. Spouses also have a problem finding jobs. `` There are much more lucrative practices in northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, spokesman for the Cabinet for Human Resources. `` Unless doctors are homegrown, they're not going to a small community. The crisis in <LOCATION> Owenton </LOCATION> is still a few checkups away. Two other doctors are practicing in the area, but one wants to retire and the other, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterse </PERSON>, is unsure whether she'll stay after her contract expires next summer.

<HEAD>B-1 Crash Prompts Grounding, Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has returned to service 25 of its 98 B-1B bombers after inspecting them for electrical, hydraulic and fule line problems, the Pentagon said today. The inspections were prompted by Tuesday's crash during a routine training flight out of <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The four men aboard ejected safely after steering the flaming aircraft away from homes where it crashed west of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday that the remaining B-1Bs, long-range bombers designed to be capable of carrying out nuclear strikes against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, would be grounded until the inspections were completed. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said 25 of the planes had been inspected and returned to flight status as of 9 a.m. EST today. Col. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, wing commander at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, said television footage of Tuesday's crash led <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials to believe the plane was downed by a fire in or around its two left-wing engines. Some training flights had resumed at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> by Wednesday afternoon. Officials said the planes flying had passed the inspection ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The inspections take two to three hours per plane, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> official at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be named, said the inspections generally focus on electrical, hydraulic and fuel lines. The official declined to be more specific, as did Lt. Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman at SAC headquarters in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. SAC, which is responsible for land-based nuclear bomber and missile forces, said the grounding and inspection order was issued Wednesday as a `` normal precaution'' in the wake of a major accident. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said the order would not affect the B-1B's current standing alert to be ready for immediate takeoff in the event of nuclear war. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> set up a roadblock to seal off the crash site Wednesday and sent in military investigators, who spent the day mapping the area and searching through debris. The wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostal </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said his speculation of a fire around the left wing engines was based on a video tape aired on a television newscast. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized over the past two years for its handling of the B-1B program, primarily because of acknowledged problems in developing the bomber's radar-jamming gear. However, the service insists the plane is still the best long-range bomber in the world. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has purchased 100 B-1Bs at a total cost of $ 27.3 billion, or about $ 273 million per plane. The last plane was delivered on April 30. Tuesday's crash was the second involving a production-model B-1B in 14 months, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> with 98 of its original 100 planes. The bombers have been deployed at four bases: <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> <PERSON> AFB </PERSON>, S.D.; Grand Forks AFB, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> AFB, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B was the first addition to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s manned bomber force in more than 25 years. The plane is designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of B-52 bombers and the new B-2 `` Stealth'' bomber, the first of which is to be publicly unveiled later this month. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lost the first of the B-1Bs on Sept. 28, 1987, when a plane based at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> ran into a flock of migrating birds during a low-level bomb run at a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> flight range. Three crew members were killed. Earlier, before production-model planes entered the inventory, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lost a B-1A prototype in August 1984 during a test flight at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. One crewman died and two were injured The bomber, built by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has a maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Baring </PERSON> a poorly kept secret, the Pentagon today made public details of a `` Stealth'' jet fighter that has been ready for five years to slip behind enemy lines in the event of war. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said the Stealth fighter first flew in June 1981 and was declared operational in October 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 59 of the planes; 52 of them have already been delivered, he said, adding the plane is a single-seat, twin-engine aircraft. The plane, which in some repsects resembles a small space shuttle with swept wings and a V-tail, was unveiled primarily because the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> needs to start flying the plane during daylight hours if it is to integrate the fighter squadron's war plans with other units, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The plane has been restricted, in the interests of secrecy and national security, to nighttime flying ever since it was declared operational, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The Stealth fighter `` is officially known as the F-117A,'' the spokesman continued. `` It has been operational since October 1983 and is assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> 4450th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Nev. The aircraft is based at the <ORGANIZATION> Tonopah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Test </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials, while releasing a photo of the plane in flight, flatly declined to discuss how much the program cost, the plane's dimensions or general capabilities such as speed, its assigned combat role, the materials from which it was constructed and the major subcontractors. The plane is built by the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at a tightly guarded plant in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. Production line workers at the <LOCATION> Lockheed </LOCATION> plant have gone to court with charges they are being sickened by exposure to dangerous chemicals. The service also acknowledged that three of the planes have crashed. The first production model of the plane crashed with a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pilot at the controls, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. That test pilot survived the accident, for which no date was given. The second crash occurred on July 11, 1986, near <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the third on Oct. 14, 1987, at <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the service said. Both pilots died in those accidents. The decision to unveil the plane was prompted in part by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to display publicly its new B-2 Stealth bomber on Nov. 22, said defense officials who asked not to be named. The bomber has been built with more recent and advanced technology than the fighter, so there was little reason to continue to hide the fighter, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials also had concluded that even if they wanted to keep the program secret, upcoming court fights were likely to shatter security, the sources continued. According to military sources, the planes are kept at a high state of readiness for use as `` aerial shock troops,'' capable of slipping behind enemy lines without being detected and creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs. The picture released by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> shows a black or dark blue metallic aircraft without exterior markings. Unlike the new Stealth bomber, which is being constructed in the shape of a flying wing without any sharp edges, the fighter resembles a sleek shuttle with a small cockpit contained in a nose that comes to a sharp point. The two engines are grouped together below the V-shaped tail and are not visible from the top or sides. The wings are swept to the rear and appear to be fixed. From some angles, the plane almost looks like a flying sting ray. The picture suggests the plane has been fabricated with some unusual materials, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss the matter.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems to have been preparing to become first lady for the 43 years since she married <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, her prep school sweetheart and the first man she ever kissed. The wife of the president-elect, with her familiar halo of white hair and a trademark pearl choker, has a mind of her own and does n't shrink from expressing her views to her husband _ in private `` I tell <PERSON> George </PERSON> what I think, and nobody else,'' she says. But she made clear she wo n't be a first lady in the highly visible style of <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who participated actively in White House debates with her husband, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` I leave the public part of it to public officials,'' she says. In fact, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says a certain independence has been her secret to a happy marriage. `` We have shared but we have not interfered in each other's life,'' she said. If she and her husband differ over a political issue, she wo n't talk about it publicly anymore In 1980, she told an interviewer that her husband `` has always been against gun control'' while she had favored gun control for years. Asked about that remark today, she replies: `` I must have been younger and more foolish in 1980.'' Interviewed on a flight to a welcome-home rally in her Rye, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, hometown a few days before her husband's election, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it will be `` a tough go'' living at 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, with the inevitable public scrutiny and criticism of her family. She's disappointed, too, that she'll have to abandon those early-morning walks in her bathrobe with their springer spaniel, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, which she enjoyed on the spacious, secluded grounds of the vice president's residence at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>. Despite her trepidation over being first lady, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 63, says `` the pluses outweight the minuses.'' She says it will give her a chance to travel, meet world leaders and promote her favorite causes, chiefly literacy and involving the private sector in Head Start and other educational programs for poor children and their families. She wo n't be another <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, rail-thin, smooth-skinned and perfectly coiffed. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prefers a lacquer-free style, wears the lightest of makeup, eats heartily, laughs boisterously and enjoys a joke, often at her own expense. Asked if she'll accept dresses loaned by American designers _ a practice that landed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in hot water _ Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` Listen, if anyone ever offered me anything, I would be beside myself with excitement. ... You know they do n't offer them to people my size.'' She says she sticks to three or four designers because it's too much trouble to shop for clothes elsewhere. The vice president, who calls his fun-loving wife `` Bar,'' credits her with helping him win the election. `` She's become a star out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said recently. `` She's very natural and people identify with her. He said her advice to him is the same she gives everyone: `` Be yourself. Do n't try to be someone you're not.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insists she has n't really changed since she married <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1945, and `` I do n't think I'm going to change'' in the White House. `` I've always run the house, taken care of the children, taken care of my grandchildren and worked hard for the causes I'm interested in,'' she said Over the years, the Bushes have lived in 17 cities and 28 homes as her husband moved from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman, congressman, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, Republican national chairman, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and president. Along the way, they raised five children, four sons and a daughter, and lost a 3-year-old girl to leukemia. All the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offspring are grown and married. The youngest is 29. There are 10 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grandchildren, one of whom lives close enough to visit frequently. She is <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, 2, daughter of son <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Reared in the bosom of privilege, the former <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> grew up in Rye, a well-heeled suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, as daughter of the head of <ORGANIZATION> McCall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> The third of four children, she met her future husband at a Christmas dance at Rye. She was 16 and home for the holidays from <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a posh private boarding school for girls in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C. He was 17, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, whose home was in nearby <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> served a fighter pilot in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in World War II, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s alma mater. She dropped out after two years to get married. Like Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, she is fiercely protective of her husband and reacts harshly to criticism of him. She terms `` very hurtful, sick'' and `` asinine' a rumor floated publicly by a campaign aide to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a sexual affair with one of his assistants. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide resigned over the remark. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent about $ 1 million reburbishing the public rooms of the White House in 1981, and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has no plans to change anything when she moves in next January. `` The china has just been changed so that is not a worry for the next president and his wife,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm not planning to leave my mark, the mark is there.'' The Bushes, however, will receive $ 50,000 in tax funds to redecorate the private living quarters at the White House.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to help pick a landing site on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> for a robot craft that the Soviets will launch in 1994, American and Soviet scientists announced Thursday at a joint news conference. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> delegation that has been negotiating with Soviet scientists, said that the Soviets have picked four candidate landing sites after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided detailed maps of the Martian surface. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said the Soviets have now asked for more data and details on the candidate sites. He made the comment at a news conference marking the end of a week of negotiations between representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and a delegation representing the Soviet solar system exploration program. The two groups met to work out areas of cooperation. Academician <PERSON> Valeriy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsukov </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation, said that the four candidate Mars landing sites are all located within 30 degrees of the equator, but he declined to be more specific. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> accumulated a vast amount of detailed images and maps of Mars during Viking spacecraft missions between 1975 and 1980. The Viking program put two craft in orbit of Mars and two on the surface. The Soviets plan to launch a spacecraft in 1994 that will orbit Mars and drop a lander that will scoop up soil and return it to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barsukov </PERSON> said that in picking a landing site the Soviets are considering such issues as a search for water and life, getting comprehensive samples of the geology, and gaining insights into the Martian evolution. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said other agreements reached during negotiations this week included: _ Using the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> to help track and communicate with Soviet Mars probes _ An exchange of scientific personnel for work on specific missions _ An exchange of data on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, a planet extensively explored by both countries <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said the U.S.-Soviet studies are being combined to produce four detailed maps. _ An exchange of lunar material gathered by the Apollo program for meteorite material collected by the Soviets _ An exchange of scientific instruments for use on planetary probes <PERSON> Barsukov </PERSON> said that the Soviets feel that a manned Mars landing is `` inevitable'' and that it probably will take place in the middle of the next century. But before a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> is attempted, <PERSON> Barsukov </PERSON> said there probably will be new manned flights to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>. He declined to elaborate.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said today the bureau is looking at a wide range of possible federal violations in connection with the criminal probe of the computer virus incident, which revolves around a 23-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student. At a news conference, Sessions said investigators are trying to determine whether statutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawful access to stored communications may have been broken. Earlier, the bureau had said it was focusing on a federal law that prohibits fraud or related activity in connection with computers, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. Sessions also said the preliminary phase of the criminal investigation probably will be completed in the next two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has told friends that he created the computer virus that disabled thousands of computers last week, but did n't intend for it to invade computer systems around the country. `` We often look at intent as being knowing and intentional doing of an act which the law forbids and knowing that the law forbids it to be done,'' Sessions said. `` But we also have other statutes which deal simply with knowingly doing something.'' The malicious mischief statute which Sessions referred to provides a maximum 10-year prison term for anyone who wilfully interferes with the use of any communications line controlled by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The unlawful access law which the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director referred to makes it a crime to prevent authorized access to electronic communications while they are in electronic storage and carries a maximum six-month jail term absent malicious destruction or damage.

But the former <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> resigned last week in a dispute with the newspapers' management. <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> that he was leaving because of <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s departure `` We were on the way to building something great,'' he said. `` Now that dream has been shattered.'' More than 150 authors, community activists and journalists deplored <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s departure in a full-page advertisement in today's editions of the newspapers `` We greatly appreciate the kind of excellence Mr. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> strove for and helped to produce, and we are concerned that the ready acceptance of his resignation signals a compromise of the high journalistic standards we have come to expect,'' the statement said. Among those whose names appeared in the advertisement were novelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, author of `` The Water is Wide,'' `` Conrack'' and `` Lords of Discipline,'' and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, former editor of The Saturday Evening Post. Also included was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the city's congressman.

<HEAD>Mothers of Vietnam War Dead Find Courage To Help Vets</HEAD>

 Nearly 20 years have passed since their sons' flag-draped coffins came home aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cargo plane from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but for <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON>, the grieving goes on. The deaths of their sons brought the two women together in 1969, and together, they have found the strength to help the men who survived the troubling war their boys did n't. One day a week, they become the `` moms'' of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outreach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, answering telephones, making coffee and sitting in the lobby to talk to anyone who comes in while the counseling group is in session. `` It's really been a lifeline for me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` I have a lot of compassion for these guys and they relate to us because they understand our pain. A lot of them have parents who are dead.'' The women first visited the center three years ago and decided to volunteer. The center, which opened in 1982, is one of 189 nationwide and has served 2,200 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in its six years. `` I still feel out of everything bad that happens to you, you can find some good if you look for it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` And I did n't happen to find any good out of his -LRB- her son <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>'s -RRB- death until 17 years later, which is the vet center. Mrs. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> also credits the center with helping her cope. She said she'll go to her grave grieving for her son <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, `` and if it had n't been for this center, I'd probably be there now.'' She has adopted the center's veterans as her sons, and they call her mom. They've laughed with her, cried with her, laid their heads on her shoulder. `` When they say, ` Mom, it's rough; he was my brother,' you feel like it's a family and you feel like he's got to come walking in here soon.'' But the place where they feel closest to their sons is the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and on Friday, the two women will make their annual Veterans Day pilgrimage to it. The first trip to the wall, after it was dedicated six years ago, was overwhelming for Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. `` When you look up there and see all those names,'' she said. `` All I could think about was all of the pain that all of those parents and wives and families, as well as myself, were still trying to deal with. `` People do n't understand. They think because a boy's been dead 20 years that you're supposed to bury him and forget that he existed. You ca n't do that. It's impossible to do that.'' Each time she goes, Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> leaves a letter for <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> at the base of the wall. The youngest of Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s three children and her second son to serve in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> was 19 when he was drafted into the 25th Infantry Division on June 11, 1968. Forty-four days after his arrival in <PERSON> Tay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> was on patrol. An American platoon mistook <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>'s group for <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> and set off a mine. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> was hit in the back, the abdomen, both legs and one arm. Four others were killed instantly. He hung on for eight hours. At the outreach center, said Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, `` I do n't talk about the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> part of his life, unless they ask me what happened to him. I talk about the living part of his life,'' his love of basketball, his desire to make people laugh. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON>, the elder of two boys, had always talked about jumping, his mother recalled, but that did n't lessen her shock when he walked in the door one day and announced he had joined the paratroopers. He did well, collecting 14 medals and citations that his mother keeps in a wood and glass case. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> was in the service 10 months and three days when he caught a bullet in the neck Aug. 27, 1968, while pulling wounded out of the way of enemy fire in Cu Chi northwest of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> received 14 shock treatments and was in and out of the hospital for 2 -LCB- years. `` People would n't believe how close we were, how happy we were,'' she said, showing a family portrait of a smiling foursome: Mrs. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON>, her <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sergeant husband, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> and her younger son, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. `` Sometimes I'd like to stand on a big mountain and say, ` Love them.' It's so easy to put your arms around them and tell them you love them. But try going and putting flowers on their graves.''

 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is the quintessential suburban mother involved in <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and school plays. But she is also a lawyer with steely determination, who induced labor for her first child so she could take the bar exam. Bright and ambitious, the wife of Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had made no secret of her desire to return to work and pursue her own career this fall after more than a decade of postponing it for motherhood. Whether that's now possible _ being a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who is also the vice president's wife _ remains to be seen. But at 39, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sees herself as part of the `` vanguard of the future'' for women of her generation, the first `` brought up to think that women should n't just look to get married, that you should have a career.'' `` There's no door closed. We've all realized that there's no set role that a woman has to take. And I can look at every opportunity and decide what's best for me without thinking of what is expected of me,'' she said in a recent interview. A lot was expected of her during the campaign, and Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said she was `` pushed hard'' by `` having as much attention drawn to me.'' Republican strategists saw her as a weapon against the controversy that sometimes surrounded her husband. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sometimes garbled his words and was flustered at tough questions. She was always cool and prepared. He did no major television interviews. She did `` 20 @ 20'' soon after the campaign began. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>, a Republican political consultant who worked with the campaign, says Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was viewed as someone who was better able to communicate with working women through `` shared experience and values'' than was her husband `` with all of his reputed good looks.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> traveled the country on her own vigorous campaign schedule. Inevitably, her crisp professional performance provoked comments, only half in jest, that she should be the vice presidential nominee. Rumor also put her in line for her husband's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat when he resigns. Insiders view that as unlikely, although Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does n't put an end to such speculation. `` I'll cross that bridge when I come to it,'' she told one interviewer. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Indianpolis </LOCATION>, the daughter of two physicians, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. The family left the local Presbyterian church for the teachings of Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thieme </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> preacher known for unorthodox biblical interpretations and for verbal attacks on liberals, welfare recipients, homosexuals and others. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a fundamentalist, admires <PERSON> Thieme </PERSON> for his interpretation of the Bible from original Greek, Hebrew and Latin versions. She says she has no knowledge of his political pronouncements. The family attends a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> church that is part of the conservative Presbyterian Church in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The couple met while attending <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and, she says, `` swept each other off our feet.'' They were married 10 weeks later. They have three children, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says she induced labor in 1974 so she could deliver in time to take the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bar exam. Her doctor, `` figured out exactly how many days before the bar exam I would be able to have <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and still be able to sit through two days of the exam,'' she said. She does n't consider that unusual, adding that `` all my other kids were induced.'' The Quayles set up a law practice above the newspaper run by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did most of the lawyering while her husband was associate publisher. After his election to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, she continued to work. She soon stopped to become a fulltime mother but not to sit home `` eating bon bons and watching the soaps.'' `` Whether it's working with study groups and doing research _ I do quite a bit of speaking _ I've managed to be able to contribute quite a bit, I think, in all different areas,'' she said. She is one of her husband's top advisers. Early in the campaign she was quite protective, tugging on his sleeve to pull him away from the press. She criticizes the media for what she says is a liberal bias and for scrutiny of her husband's military service, academic record and personal life. But resentment, she says, `` is n't part of my life.'' She says she is not bitter, for example, that her career may once again be put on hold by her husband's vice presidency. `` Why be unhappy? Take every opportunity you have to make the best out of the situation. You do n't stew on things that might have been.''

 An explosion today trapped three workmen in a sewer tunnel under construction, and dangerous levels of methane gas forced rescuers to turn back, the Fire Department said. The workers' condition was not immediately known Deputy Chief <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said the men were trapped approximately 2,000 feet into the tunnel and about 40 feet below the surface. Rescuers awaited equipment to remove the methane, a byproduct of decomposition believed responsible for the explosion, and pump in fresh air. `` It's too hazardous for anyone to go in at this time,'' Battalion Chief <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Luedke </PERSON> said. `` With one little spark we will have another explosion.'' It was not immediately known how long it would take for the equipment to arrive. <PERSON> Luedke </PERSON> declined to say whether the workers were still alive. <PERSON> Luedke </PERSON>, head of the department's tunnel rescue unit, said two rescuers went about 1,200 feet into the tunnel but turned back after detecting methane levels of 6 percent. He said a reading above 4 percent is considered dangerous. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Doig </PERSON>, project manager for the contractor <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said 10 men were in the tunnel when a detection device showed high levels of methane. All of the men left the tunnel, he said, and then three went back in to check gas levels. That was when the explosion occurred, he said. The tunnel, part of a $ 2.1 billion project to expand the city's sewage treatment and collection program, will be used to store untreated sewage It is not yet connected to the existing sewer system. Methane is formed by the decomposition of organic matter and is found in sewers, mines and marshes.

 Declaring an independent Palestinian state will not change the reality of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, but many Palestinians see the implied recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a possible step toward peace. After 11 months of revolt in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, in which more than 300 of them have been killed, Palestinians are frustrated that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> already has rejected the declaration expected at a weekend meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. They hope, however, that basing the declaration on a 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that calls for Arab and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> states in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> will convince Western public opinion the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> wants to negotiate peace. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has called on the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which meets Saturday in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, to declare an independent state in the occupied lands. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> created the 450-member council 24 years ago to serve as the Palestinian legislature and not all its members belong to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazala </PERSON>, a prominent pro-PLO Palestinian in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said: `` I do not take this declaration as merchandise to be sold to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. I am selling this idea to <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and American public opinion.'' He said he hopes Western nations, especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will bring pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to begin peace talks when the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has softened its position. `` This is something new,'' he said. `` No longer is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> denying the existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A Palestinian state declared through the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will recognize the willingness of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to go to a peace conference with the Israelis.'' Basing the independence declaration on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> General Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947 could be interpreted as implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but that probably will not satisfy conditions <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have set for dealing directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The 1968 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Covenant calling for armed struggle and destruction of the Jewish state is another element in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> opposition to direct dealings. Some Palestinians say the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> can get around that by having a provisional government write a constitution to replace the Covenant. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Nov. 1 parliamentary elections were indecisive but seemed to give the edge in forming a government to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who opposes trading occupied land for peace, has said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would never accept a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and a declaration of independence would be an obstacle to peace because the Arabs would have difficulty backing down from it. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had instructions sent to Israeli diplomats saying <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> partition plan was irrelevant because of the Arab attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1948. <PERSON> Haidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Shafi </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the Moslem equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be a mistake to extend direct recognition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without something in return. `` We are declaring we accept the two-state formula, but there's a limit,'' he said. `` Should we be expected to go farther, to acknowledge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when it claims all of the land?'' Support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> approach is far from universal among the 1.5 Palestinians of the occupied territories. The Islamic fundamentalist movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- declared in in a leaflet distributed Thursday: `` If you sign an agreement with the Jews, in whose name do you speak? No for the Zionist state in the land of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Yes to the armed struggle.'' Other Palestinians want direct recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, contending that would strengthen the political initiative provided by the uprising. On a street in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> where anti-Israeli graffiti covered the walls, 27-year-old tailor <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Atoud </PERSON> said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> should make decisions which serve our interests. If they do n't take a decision to clearly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, all the suffering will be in vain.'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a leading <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist, said: `` A declaration of independence will give people hope. ... It encourages people to keep going.''

<TEXT>
 The Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has voted to take `` farmers'' out of its name because the word was hurting recruiting. Delegates at the 61st annual convention of the Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> voted with little debate Wednesday to rename the group the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION> officers and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisers to the organization had recommended the name change to help stop a 23 percent decline in membership since the mid-1970s. The <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION> has some 416,000 active members nationwide. FFA is open to students interested in agriculture or related fields, such as agricultural economy, farm equipment technology and agribusiness. Local chapters will be permitted to use the old name if they prefer. The organization's 113-member legislative body also voted to strip the words `` vocational agriculture'' from the <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION> symbol, constitution and bylaws and replace them with the words `` agricultural education.'' Backers said the new terminology is more comprehensive and reflects changes in agriculture. The delegates also voted to offer <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION> membership, now confined to high school and college students, to seventh and eighth graders.

<HEAD>Farm Lawmakers Assail Reagan for Nutrition Veto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm lawmakers said Thursday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a nutrition monitoring bill was `` unfortunate and unnecessary'' and vowed to push for passage again when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes. `` The president's veto of nutrition monitoring legislation on election day is astonishing,'' said a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> and nine other lawmakers, including two Republicans. The bill vetoed Wednesday by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for a 10-year assessment of the health and well-being of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and the American diet with special focus on the elderly, pregnant women, infants, children and the homeless. Under the bill, the secretaries of agriculture and health and human services would have reviewed in advance any federal advice to consumers on what and what not to eat. The provision was designed to make the federal government speak with one voice on nutrition and safety issues. `` We believe the veto of this legislation was unfortunate and necessary,'' the statement said. `` We will press for passage of this legislation at the outset of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' which meets in January. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in vetoing the measure that the `` administration strongly supports the principal goals of this legislation and reaffirms its commitment to use existing authority to achieve these ends.'' He said in a statement, however, that `` enactment of the bill would set up federal nutrition efforts on the wrong course.'' `` The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the bill's goals,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The congressional statement was signed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, as well as Sens <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, D-Ariz.; and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, and Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa., and <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>, R-N.Y.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report Thursday blamed executive complacency and an `` uncoordinated, haphazard and untrained'' staff response in last year's subway fire that killed 31 people in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground's worst tragedy The transit system's top two executives resigned as the report was released eight days before the first anniversary of the Nov. 18, 1987, fire that erupted in busy King's Cross station in the heart of the capital. Sir <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> that controls the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground, resigned Wednesday night and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground's chairman and chief executive, quit Thursday. The blaze, at the end of evening rush hour, was the worst accident in the 120-year history of the system. Among the points made by <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>, the lawyer who headed the 91-day investigation: _ The fire was caused by a lighted match falling through a gap beside escalator treads. It ignited grease and fluff on the escalator tracks and funneled flames upward to a ticketing plaza that became an inferno. _ Staff at King's Cross were `` woefully ill-equipped,'' never applying a drop of water or using a single fire extinguisher. `` Their overall response may be characterized as uncoordinated, haphazard and untrained,'' and there was `` a general failure to appreciate the severity of the disaster.'' _ <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground was `` lulled into a false sense of security because no previous escalator fire had caused a death.'' Its `` blinkered approach'' held that `` fires were inevitable on the oldest and most extensive underground system in the world.'' _ Management had `` a blind spot over the hazards of fire on escalators,'' and had a rule, withdrawn only after the blaze, always to refer to fires as `` smolderings.'' <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> wrote that <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground had no system for training staff in fire drill or evacuation. The report said Bright was `` mistaken as to his responsibility'' over his board's failure to monitor safety as strictly as it monitored its finances. The management had failed to put a high priority on safety because no one was in overall charge of the matter. Annual fire brigade inspections, conducted at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground's invitation, were inadequate, the report said. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground's management, under <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, was `` fundamentally in error'' in regarding fires as inevitable, it said. The report made 157 recommendations for the biggest shakeup the transit system has known. They ranged from organizational changes to physical measures such as removing wood paneling and installing TV monitors and smoke detectors. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, in a resignation statement, called the report `` an emotive document'' but did not criticize it outright. Bright made no comment, but <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, who ordered the inquiry, said the 57-year-old executive had offered to resign immediately after the fire `` but I asked him to stay during a difficult period and he did.'' He promised the government would act on the report's recommendations as `` quickly and as vigorously as possible. He said $ 476 million would be spent over the next three years to make stations safer. But the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sought to fix the blame on the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, saying its budget-cutting doctrines pressured <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground into cutting corners on safety in order to reduce its dependency on government subsidies. Families of the dead are considering a private prosecution of the management. <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarassenko </PERSON>, whose brother, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>, perished, said she felt relief when she read the report. `` It has been a furstrating 12 months where everyone seemed to be washing their hands of the whole business,'' she said. `` We are glad the report names names and we think it was right for Sir <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> to resign.''

<HEAD>AIDS Infections In Military Recruits Falling Somewhat</HEAD>

 The percentage of new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military recruits with AIDS infections is decreasing, apparently because more men who fear they may be infected are n't signing up, federal health officials said Thursday. In the first six months of the military's testing program for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, beginning in October 1985, 15 out of every 10,000 recruits were found to show signs of AIDS virus infection. However, between October 1987 and March 1988, 12 in every 10,000 recruits were infected, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Our leading hypothesis is that it reflects self-deferral among high-risk applicants _ people who know they have -LRB- AIDS virus -RRB- infections, or suspect they might be at increased risk, are not coming into the recruitment centers,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwinn </PERSON>, an AIDS specialist with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. One reason researchers believe high-risk recruits may be staying away is that although there has been a `` statistically significant decrease'' in AIDS infection among male recruits, infection rates among female recruits _ who may be less likely to think they are infected _ have stayed largely constant, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. The rate of AIDS infection among male recruits has dropped from 17 per 10,000 in initial testing to 12 in the latest numbers, while the rate for female recruits has risen from seven per 10,000 to eight. `` Women may be less aware of their risk for ... infection,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Only 9 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases have occurred in females; homosexual or bisexual males account for 68 percent. The military has tested more than 1.5 million recruits for AIDS infection. More than 2,100, or 0.1 percent, have tested positive. Federal health officials estimate that about 0.6 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is infected with the AIDS virus. Although AIDS infection rates are lower among military recruits than the public _ largely because gay men and drug users are subject to exclusion from military service _ the military test results are still of interest to researchers, Ms. <PERSON> Gwinn </PERSON> said. `` If the incidence of infection were to decline, we might detect it first in the youngest age groups,'' she said, noting that military recruits tend to be in their late teens or early 20s. `` Were we to see a dramatic decline in the youngest age group, it would be potentially encouraging,'' she added. `` That is not what is happening at the present time, though.''

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Flat as Food Costs Show First Decline in Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wholesale price inflation slowed to zero last month as food costs dropped for the first time since February, reflecting an easing of the effects of the summer drought, the government said Thursday. Fresh-fruit prices plummeted 9.2 percent to lead a 0.1 percent decline in food prices on the wholesale level, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Large drops also occurred in prices for vegetables, pasta, fish, beef, pork and cooking oils. Food prices had been climbing at an annual rate of 8 percent before the reversal. While the turnaround indicated the initial effects of the driest summer in decades on food prices are over, analysts said consumers can expect a second round of drought-related increases next spring when shortages of meat and pork appear because of earlier-than-normal slaughters this year. `` It's just temporary,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who runs a private economic forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Next year we'll see the lag effects of the drought and food prices will be up sharply again.'' Wholesale prices increases for food have totaled 4.5 percent over the past 12 months, paralleling the rate of consumer price inflation in general. But including energy and other products, wholesale prices overall are only 2.9 percent above a year ago. `` International competition is still forcing the industrial sector to fight cost increases ever more vigorously,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` There was a bunch of aberrations last month that added up to zero, and that certainly is good news,'' Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't think we should stop worrying about inflation.'' Energy prices rose a slight 0.3 percent in October as a 4.6 percent increase in natural gas prices caused primarily by shortages in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> was offset by a 10.1 percent decline in home heating oil prices and no change in gasoline prices. Energy prices are still 5.7 percent below what they were a year ago, and analysts said they expect them to begin falling again by spring. Before the seasonal adjustments, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index for all finished goods _ including energy and food _ rose 0.6 percent to 109.3. That means that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 at the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost $ 109.30 last month. The same basket of goods would have cost $ 108.60 in September and $ 107.70 a year ago. The seasonal adjustment process is designed to remove predictable, periodic influences from the calculation of price changes. Analysts said the difference between the seasonally adjusted prices and real ones was primarily connected with the introduction of 1989-model automobiles. After the seasonal adjustments, which are intended to spread out the effect of auto price hikes associated with the introduction of new 1989 models, new car prices fell 1.7 percent. `` The introduction of new models are strung out now instead of being lumped into September and October and the seasonal adjustments do n't reflect the changes as well as they used to,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated the value of quality changes in the new 1989 models _ such as government-mandated passive restraints, new corrosion protection and improvements in power trains _ at $ 153.69 per vehicle, or 34.6 percent of the average $ 444.08 increase in price to dealers. Alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.6 percent on the wholesale level last month after declining by 0.3 percent in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Women's and men's apparel costs were up 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, while prices for children's clothing fell 0.3 percent after rising 0.6 percent in the back-to-school buying month of September. Prescription drug prices rose 0.4 percent and were 9.3 percent above what they were a year earlier. Cosmetics rose 0.5 percent on October but were only 2.9 percent higher than during the same month in 1987. Household furniture prices rose 0.8 percent last month and were 4.5 percent above what they were a year ago. Including a 0.5 percent decline last month, wholesale prices for household appliances have risen only 0.7 percent in the last year. Also pacing the slight drop in food costs last month were declines of 1.9 percent for fresh vegetables, 5.8 percent for pasta, 0.9 percent for fish, 4.0 percent for cooking oils and 1.6 percent for beef and pork. Offsetting them were increases of 1.9 percent for processed chickens, 8.0 percent for turkeys, 7.3 percent for eggs and 1.0 percent for canned fruits and vegetables. Prices for intermediate goods further back in the production chain _ items such as plastic parts, cement, paints, fertilizers, lumber and chemicals _ also were flat in October but 5.3 percent higher than a year earlier. Raw material prices for crude products such as oil, agricultural commodities, scrap aluminium, iron ore and timber declined 0.1 percent last month and are only 0.5 percent above what they were a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The opinion polls ended the presidential election on a harmonious note: Most of them predicted the outcome fairly accurately, if none precisely. The final pre-election polls did not hit the election's numbers right on the head _ 54 percent to 46 percent for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But they were close, with estimates of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead ranging from four to 11 points. CBS News came nearest to the actual spread: Its final national survey Tuesday morning found a 52-43 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead, a nine-point margin. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll was next closest, putting it at 10 points. And <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> pollsters won bragging rights on another score: They exactly predicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s total in their 54-44 percent estimate. Better than that, a huge 50-state ABC-Post poll done the week before the election came extremely close to predicting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s total in the electoral college. It put him ahead for 439 electoral votes; he won 426. `` I'm very happy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief pollster, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>. `` We had a very, very good year.'' Other polls were a tad farther off on the outcome. At one end of the scale, Gallup had an 11-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead in its last poll, 53-42 percent, and a <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today-CNN </ORGANIZATION> poll also had an 11-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead, 55-44. At the other end, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> survey estimated a five-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead, 48-43, and the final <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll had it at four, 51-47. Reasons for the disparity included the varying methods of identifying who is most likely to vote, and also the pollsters' efforts to apportion at least some of the voters who said they were undecided or only leaning Only Gallup was brave enough before the election to try an estimate of how all its undecideds would vote; it arrived at a 56-44 percent result, a 12-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> margin. But even that estimate was within the margin of sampling error of the outcome. `` We have a lot of people disappointed here that we did n't hit it right on the nose. I said, God, every time you're within sampling error you've done your job,'' said Gallup pollster <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>. `` Some of our people remember the last time, and they're spoiled.'' The last time was the 1984 election, when Gallup, applying the same methods, estimated a <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> victory of 59-41 percent. He won, 59-41. `` A certain part of this,'' said <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, `` is just luck.''

The source reported that <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> were later released, and that <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> pledged not to attend the symposium. The raids followed a police crackdown two weeks ago in which more than 100 dissidents were detained to prevent them from attending a rally in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Oct. 28 marking 70 years of Czechoslovak independence. In another development, 20 prominent intellectuals, including several of those arrested, were reported Thursday to have set up a <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to support and publicize the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> human rights accords and related documents. Banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, chairman of the committee organizing this weekend's symposium, was not detained, the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 An African ground hornbill who flew the coop at the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Zoo has returned to captivity, but it may have been luck, not love, that ended his freedom. The 5-year-old bird abandoned his mate Violet on Monday morning, possibly because he was unhappy about sharing his digs with the kudu, an antelope. Or it could have been that <PERSON> Violet </PERSON> was ignoring his mating overtures, in which he made ostentatious displays and carried twigs to her. What's worse, zoo workers have n't even gotten around to naming him. The bird spent the night in some nearby woods and returned home Tuesday. Zoo Curator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> said he was unsure `` if he came back because of Violet, whether he was familiar with the area and wanted to get back to the exhibit, or if our catching him was just dumb luck.'' The bird, which is two feet tall and has a bright orange face with an eight-inch beak, was cornered by <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> and his staff in tall weeds along the zoo fence. Violet did n't seem terribly concerned about her mate's disappearance, <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> said `` She did n't pace the yard, or seem upset that he left at all,'' he said. Now that the pair is together again, zoo officials hope the winter cold will rekindle their courtship. `` We obviously want to get some breeding going,'' he said. `` So we're going to try some different things next spring.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials Thursday threw their weight behind efforts to stop fraud in the marketplace by crushing 17,000 counterfeit wristwatches with a steamroller. The fake Rolex, <PERSON> Patek </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Corum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON> watches _ further proof that all that glitters is not gold _ were flattened into looping metallic pancakes. They were seized more than three years ago in a joint <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs-Secret Service case codenamed `` Operation Stopwatch.'' Customs officials believe more than $ 3 billion worth of counterfeit goods are produced each year in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> alone. Fake designer leather goods and watches are among popular items. The officials said Swiss watch manufacturers estimate more than 10 million counterfeit watches are sold worldwide each year. Customs officials said 26 people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were arrested, tried, and convicted on fraud charges stemming from Operation Stopwatch. Once final appeals in the case were completed, the 17,000 watches were ordered destroyed. The value of the watches _ even as fakes _ was put at more than $ 620,000. Agents said the timepieces could be sold for $ 20 to $ 40 each in wholesale lots.

<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two specialists from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> says they have developed a new form of their experimental treatment for AIDS, which they plan to try on four American patients. The vaccine, named MM-2, was developed by Professor <PERSON> Zirimwabago </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurhuma </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and Professor <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafik </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and has been administered to animals in preliminary tests. The MM-2 is an improved version of their vaccine MM-1, without its side-effects of MM-1, notably the pain and fever, <PERSON> Lurhuma </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday. It is to be tried shortly on a group of four American AIDS patients who came specially from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the treatment, supervised by American specialists. The American patients and doctors were not identified. <PERSON> Shafik </PERSON> said it was possible that other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> patients would come to <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> soon to undergo the treatment. The treatment consists of about 20 injections spread over three months, followed by a three-month rest period. At the end of the rest period, many cases of remission had been observed, <PERSON> Lurhuma </PERSON> said. `` We want to let as much time go by as possible to judge the effectiveness of the method,'' <PERSON> Lurhuma </PERSON> said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Dutch policemen took to the streets Thursday to protest a government-proposed restructuring of pay scales and what they claim amounts to a nationwide manpower reduction. In <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> alone, an estimated 1,500 members of the municipal police force took part in a rush hour demonstration that caused chaos in the city center, a police spokesman said. Action leaders also announced a 12-hour slowdown in law enforcement, meaning that `` only the most serious cases will be acted upon,'' according to spokesman <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolven </PERSON>. Similar demonstrations involving another 1,000 policemen were reported in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, the world's largest port, and the southern Dutch city of <LOCATION> Tilburg </LOCATION>. At issue is a government report proposing to restructure police pay scales, which police unions claim would entail serious cuts in overtime pay. The report also recommended a huge reorganization of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' police force involving the transfer of about 2,600 officers from rural forces to the big cities. `` We're fearing that such a reorganization will also lead to force reductions,'' <PERSON> Wolven </PERSON> said. The report's recommendations have not yet been adopted by Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>'s center-right government, which came to power in 1986 on a strong anti-crime platform promising to increase the size of the police force.

 An age-old economic principle _ encouraging price competition _ can help reduce escalating hospital costs, according to a study. The study provides the first evidence that new laws intended to increase competition among hospitals can help moderate or reverse the rise in costs, said health economist <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Melnick </PERSON> cautioned that more research is needed to determine what impact these policies may have on the quality of care, research and education and medical services to the poor. `` The question arises, were costs lowered by becoming more efficient or did patient-care quality ... suffer,'' said <PERSON> Melnick </PERSON>, who co-authored the study published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION>, Ill.-based <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization representing 26,000 financial managers of hospitals and other health care facilities, said increased price competition was a mixed blessing. `` The competition is having some positive effect in dampening unnecessary expenditures for new services that might be duplicated at a nearby hospital,'' said association spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowll </PERSON>. `` But there is a downside to that in that patient convenience and access to care is being diminished, and as a practical matter, you're going to see longer waiting lines in hospital outpatient departments,'' he said. `` There has been no significant indication that quality has been impacted yet, but we certainly have fears that you can only tighten the screws so much until quality will suffer.'' The study examined the impact on all 450 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> hospitals of a 1982 state law that allowed the state Medicaid program and private insurers to negotiate favorable terms from certain hospitals without fear of antitrust action. The `` selective contracting'' law was the first in the country intended to encourage health-care price competition. <PERSON> Melnick </PERSON> and co-author <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwanziger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said that previous studies of hospital competition indicated that competition based on the quality of doctors, equipment or other amenities led only to higher costs. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law was unique in that it was intended to foster cost-reducing competition. Since its passage, similar legislation has been enacted in more than half the states, spurring a boom in health-care maintenance and preferred provider organization insurance plans, <PERSON> Melnick </PERSON> said. The study found that costs among all <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> hospitals, adjusted for inflation, rose an average 4.8 percent a year between 1980-82, but decreased 0.4 percent annually from 1983-85 after the new law took effect. In the most competitive urban centers, total inflation-adjusted inpatient costs actually decreased a total of 11.3 percent in 1983-85. Inpatient costs for hospitals in low-competition markets, or markets with very few hospitals, increased by less than 1 percent during the same period. `` Hospitals and physicians located in areas with many competitors or substantial excess capacity are more likely to agree to accept lower fees ... in return for the promise of a continued flow of patients,'' the study said. `` Given current national trends ... the behavior now observed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is likely to spread to the rest of the country.'' <PERSON> Melnick </PERSON> said hospital management had been able to adapt `` very rapidly and in dramatic ways to cut cost ... in what has traditionally been an industry not considered to be very entrepreneurial.'' The study found that patients were spending less time on average in hospitals and that there was a `` significant shift from inpatient to outpatient services,'' with hospitals competing directly with doctors for ambulatory care.

 Soda machines that tip over when rocked by people wanting their money back or a free drink can maim or kill and should be fixed so they wo n't fall, an Army doctor said Thursday. In a study published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosio </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> documented 11 deaths from falling soda machines. One victim was found pinned to a wall with the soda machine resting on his neck. Death was presumed to be due to suffocation. Others were crushed to death or asphyxiated. `` If you look at it from the victims' standpoint ... if they get hurt if a machine lands on them, they have a 20 -LRB- perent -RRB- to 25 percent chance that they get killed,'' <PERSON> Cosio </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Changes are needed to safeguard the public, he said, and a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the agency is investigating the problem. `` Few people would believe that a soda vending machine can be tipped over or that anyone would be foolish enough to even try to tip such a machine,'' <PERSON> Cosio </PERSON> wrote in the study. `` Not only can these machines be tipped over, but they can injure and even kill.'' <PERSON> Cosio </PERSON> looked at accidents involving 15 males at military installations overseas from July 1985 to September 1987. Three were killed, and 12 victims required hospitalization. A follow-up of 32 more males, some civilians, documented eight more deaths, he said. The victims all were shaking or rocking the machines, he said, some to shake loose a soda without paying, others `` because they're angry at the machine'' for keeping their money and not dispensing a soda `` I usually just bang on the front or jiggle the coin return and if it does n't work, I just walk away,'' <PERSON> Cosio </PERSON> said. The machines generally weigh 800 pounds to 1,000 pounds, but when not anchored, they can be tipped over without much force, he said. `` We've even had a 10-year-old child who got killed.'' Survivors `` made the same or similar statement about the descent of the machine,'' he wrote. `` In essence, each victim said, ` It came down faster than I thought. I pushed up, but it was too heavy and it kept coming. I tried to get out of the way but it caught me.''' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal consumer safety agency, said it is investigating, `` and yes, of course, we consider it a problem. We have n't decided what to do about it.'' `` It appears that these deaths and injuries are related to one brand,'' <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said, but he declined to identify which one because of the continuing investigation. `` If we can pin it down as a brand-name specific problem, then we can ... work for repair or replacement or some other remedial measure,'' he said. <PERSON> Cosio </PERSON> said machines that dispense free sodas when rocked should be removed from the market, and others should be secured to the floor or wall to help avert tipovers.

<TEXT>
 American voters showed again this week a ticket-splitting bent that some pundits say has created a new, extra-constitutional check on the balance of power in the nation's capital Republican President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have a solidly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to contend with, and the Democrats also padded their lead Tuesday in both governorships and state legislatures. Whatever happened to the `` yellow-dog Democrats'' _ the ones who supposedly would vote for a yellow dog if it ran as a Democrat _ or to any yellow-dog Republicans, for that matter? Why is the electorate so fickle when it comes to following the party line? `` This was a unique situation where the candidate of a winning party for president saw his side lose in senators, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and governors,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, publisher of the American Political Report. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, citing Wall Street Journal @ NBC News exit polling, saw a sort of `` negative coattails'' effect with some voters, `` the sense that you had to set one bunch to watch the others.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had an awful time trying to dodge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charge that he was a freebooting, big-spending liberal, lost the key industrial state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> by 10 points and nearly a half-million votes But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was n't the biggest vote-getter in the <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> state. That honor went to incumbent Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, who piled up a 57-43 margin in trouncing challenger <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, the Republican mayor of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> is one of the most outspoken liberals in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and is arguably to the left of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> constantly tried to remind <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> voters. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> political analyst, said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> `` had the image of a populist, a fighter, a tough aggressive campaigner who delivered for the people of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.'' `` But <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> would not have carried <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> as a presidential candidate,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` The higher the office, the more ideology matters, and the more ideology matters, the worse Democrats do,'' he said. The public feels safe in voting Democratic for lower offices `` because frankly ideology, values, philosophy seldom get engaged in local and state races.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party chief now co-chairing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commisssion </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The closer to home you get, the more the people vote Democratic. We do well in cities as well as in counties and state legislatures. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is still the oldest, largest political party in the world, and it's stil closer to the people than any political party in the world. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` People intuitively, if they are not in favor of divided government, they obviously have nothing against it.'' `` You can make a pretty good founding fathers-case that that kind of government makes a certain degree of sense,'' he said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> senior fellow, rejects the idea that the people are imposing `` a new type of extra-constitutional check and balance'' on the politicians in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I think what's happend is that we have very weak parties and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people do n't care. They're indifferent to this,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. `` People now, without the moorings of party, are extremely interested in personality, character and results.'' He added, `` It does n't offend them or even perhaps much interest them whether they vote for a Democrat for governor and then turn around and vote for a Republican for senator, and then a <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, and so forth in some political pingpong.''

 A request by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, for a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would be subjected to severe scrutiny, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Our view of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has n't changed,'' spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Arab diplomats in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> spread word this week that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would like to participate when the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> considers the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> situation later this year. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` to facilitate the issuance of a visa.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke to the assembly in 1974, appealing to its members to `` aid our people in its struggle to attain its right to self-determination.'' Concluding his address, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief said he had come `` bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is sworn by its covenant to the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It has been implicated by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in incidents of terrorism against Americans and Israelis. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he had `` no desire whatever to see <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He made the comment in a letter responding to a request from 51 senators to deny <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` we will severely scrutinize any application for a visa in light of applicable laws and regulations and other pertinent circumstances.'' He declined to elaborate. Under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters Agreement of 1947, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not supposed to `` impose any impediment to transit'' of people involved in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on official business. On the other hand, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has authorized the denial of visas to supporters of terrorism. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the strictures on obtaining a visa for <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> business were less severe than `` if he wanted to come down to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or to go someplace else.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office to Counter Terrorism has linked the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee to known terrorists. The Israeli government and Jewish groups have protested a visit by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader, who has never renounced the provision in his organization's covenant calling for the dismantling of the Jewish state. `` We do not deem <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> welcome in any international forum,'' said <PERSON> Barukh </PERSON> <PERSON> Binah </PERSON>, spokesman for the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commited the original sin _ the acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is a terrorist organization in the first place. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has never changed its covenent which still calls for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` and has never renounced terrorism or accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338,'' which recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist within secure borders.

 Two burned, empty lifeboats were found Thursday on an oily patch of the north <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, but there were no signs of the 27 crewmen from a tanker that broke in two in stormy seas and burst into flames, searchers said. A Canadian military plane flew over the wreckage of the Odyssey and found its bow `` barely afloat,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Search </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. The stern section of the 65,746-ton tanker sank after the vessel cracked in half. Oil spilled into the ocean and caught fire, coating the surface with flames that burned hours later. <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> said none of the Greek and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> crewmen was seen on the bow or in the two badly burned lifeboats floating in the area. He said the tanker was also believed to carry two life rafts. `` If we ca n't find them, there's not much hope,'' <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> said. Photographs taken of the scene will be analyzed to see if there are any signs of the crewmen, he said. The Odyssey, a Liberian-registered vessel, sent out a distress signal at 3:22 a.m. about 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, saying it needed immediate assistance, coast guard officials said. The Soviet weather Passat was the first vessel to reach the Odyssey. It was 26 miles away when the distress signal was sent out and rushed to help, but flaming oil kept the Passat from getting closer than a mile to the stricken vessel, said British and Canadian <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> Polembros </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, operators of the Odyssey, said the tanker had a Greek captain, 14 Greek officers and 12 Honduran sailors. `` I am afraid that we have heard nothing at all of survivors,'' said a company spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity. `` There is still a search going on for them.'' `` It does n't sound very good at all,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, who by custom was not identified. `` The Soviet vessel has lost radio contact with the tanker.'' In addition to the Passat, another vessel, the bulk carrier Maritime Wisdom, responded to the distress call and was searching for survivors. <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> said the air search would last into the night. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said Canadian officials reported an oil slick 10 miles long and three miles wide in the area. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s said the Odyssey left Sullom Voe, a Scottish oil terminal, on Nov. 5 and was heading for the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> port of Come By Chance when it broke apart. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> reported stormy weather with winds of 43 mph and high seas and swells. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said the Canadian aircraft reported visibility was reasonable for searching aircraft, but not for surface vessels. The Odyssey was built in 1971 and owned by <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>. Its distress signal was picked up by <ORGANIZATION> Valentia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and relayed to British coast guard officials in <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION> who alerted the Passat, said a coast guard spokesman, who by custom was not identified. The tanker is in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> sector of responsibility covered by the Canadians, and the emergency operation was being coordinated in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> with assistance from British coast guard officials.

 The super collider <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will name for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was an economic dream for the six other finalists for the $ 4.4 billion atom smasher, and some losers complained Thursday that politics played a part in the site selected. Gov. Rose Mofford of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, one of the losing states, noted that the annoucement was made `` only 48 hours after the election'' of Texan <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president. The governor of another losing state was n't necessarily blaming politics, but money. `` Colorado will compete on its merits,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>. `` It is not going to buy it. This state does n't have to pay for people to come here.'' He said <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> offered no financial incentives for the project. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters approved a $ 1.1 billion bond package that would reduce the federal cost of building the atom smasher in <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., said he doubted presidential politics played a role since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still has to provide the money But he also said, `` If there's a taint of politicalization, then this project will never become a reality.'' `` This is a very political animal,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Granville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioners in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, one of the proposed sites. `` I think politics played into it and they have more political clout down there.'' But the head of the physics department at <LOCATION> Fermilab </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, looked at it another way. He said the selection of a site was `` really a good sign that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wants to support high energy physics and wants to support basic research and wants to recapture a position they have been frittering away.''

 Singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON>, who has said he wants to fly in a Soviet spacecraft, apparently has balked at the $ 10 million price he said the Soviets wanted him to pay. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON>, head of the Soviet commercial space agency Glavkosmos, told a news conference Thursday that a `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> singer'' had failed to meet a Nov. 1 application deadline set by the Soviets. `` We have n't gotten a serious request from him,'' <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON> said, without identifying the singer by name. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> had said last month that he had until Nov. 1 to accept a `` very serious'' invitation to fly aboard a Soviet spacecraft. But he said the Soviets' insistence that he pay $ 10 million would likely prompt him to drop the project. `` I've told them that I'm opposed to paying $ 10 million, that I think it's inappropriate, that I think it's negative and that it's not the way I want to pursue this endeavor,'' <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> had said For that fee, <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> said the Soviets told him he could fly aboard a Soviet spacecraft and spend time aboard the Mir space station. `` At this point they have a slot open for me, December of next year,'' he said.'' <PERSON> Dunaev </PERSON> did not mention a specific price tag set for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but indicated it would go up. `` If he expresses the desire again, it will be much more expensive for him,'' he said. One Western musical act will be going into space with the Soviets this month, if only in the form of a recording. Officials told reporters that a special recording had been made by the British pop music group <ORGANIZATION> Pink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Floyd </ORGANIZATION> for a joint Soviet-French spaceflight scheduled for Nov. 26.

 A Veteran's Day memorial service Friday to honor the late <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, this city's last World War I veteran, will be more lively than thought. In fact, the 88-year-old <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says he would n't miss it. `` Do I look dead?'' asked the smiling former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and last surviving member of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s World War I Barracks No. 879. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, city planner and organizer of the planned memorial to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, explained that three people had told him <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> died this summer. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said the confusion apparently arose from the disbanding of Barracks No. 879 earlier in the year. `` No. 879 was dead,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` It got taken the wrong way'' and the whole thing `` just mushroomed.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who lives at a local Veteran's Administration nursing home, just chuckled over the incident after getting over an initial shock. North Miami Mayor <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neu </PERSON> had the plaque for <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> changed.

 Israeli troops in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> wounded 12 Palestinians on Thursday and blew up the homes of nine accused of attacking soldiers with grenades or firebombs. Islamic fundamentalists urged the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which convenes Saturday in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, to wage an armed struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and criticized those who favor peace negotiations. A leaflet distributed by a group called <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- said: `` Who authorized the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> to sign a peace agreement with the Jews? Is it the Palestinian martyrs, is it the wounded, is it the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> child ... who lost an eye sitting in his mother's lap? `` We announce clearly: ` No to a Zionist state in the land of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, no to peace with murderers ... yes to the armed struggle.''' The 450-member <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION>, which serves as a Palestinian legislature, is expected to declare an independent state in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 11 Israelis and at least 310 Palestinians have been killed in an 11-month-old rebellion against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Its declaration is expected to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> indirectly by accepting a 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution that called for dividing <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> into Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops are expected to seal off the occupied territories during the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting, barring journalists without escorts and prohiting Palestinians from traveling to and from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said the demolition of nine houses was a lesson to Palestinians that `` those who try to hurt us with grenades and firebombs will find themselves hurt.'' He said the houses belonged to two Palestinians who hurled grenades at army patrols and members of a gang accused of firebomb attacks on soldiers. Two soldiers were slightly wounded in a grenade attack Oct. 12. `` We found five more grenades, a pistol, an M-16 rifle, dynamite sticks, plastic explosives and other weapons,'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. He is chief of the army's southern command. Palestinians told Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group founded by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> lawyers, that soldiers bulldozed 72 houses in the Jifliq shantytown near a settlement where an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was stabbed to death Monday. Army spokesmen said residents who had settled in <LOCATION> Jifliq </LOCATION> illegally were being forced to return to their home villages. They would not reveal the number of houses knocked down. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers raided seven Palestinian homes overnight in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> marked district, Palestinian witnesses reported. They said it was the third such action in as many days. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said the raids were intended to prevent violence during the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> meeting and several Palestinians were detained. Palestinians confirmed a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily that soldiers smashed windows, vandalized furniture and beat residents, then ordered them into the streats to remove barricades from roads and paint over anti-Israeli graffiti. The army said it was checking the report. Violent confrontations were reported in our <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps. Arab hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded 12 Palestinians, including a 14-year-old girl and two boys aged 13 and 15. Military authorities imposed curfews on several refugee camps, confining 173,000 Palestinians to their homes. Members of the Jerusalem-based <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> demanded the immediate release of 24 Palestinian reporters who have been in jail for six months without trial under emergency regulations. `` These are repressive measures aimed at depriving the Palestinian people of knowing what is happening in the occupied territories,'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president is likely to be more of a hands-on manager than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, more interested in foreign policy, less ideological. The man who promises a kinder and gentler nation also says the stillness of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will be broken when he takes over by the sound of 10 grandchildren laughing and crying. The jelly bean jars in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House probably will be replaced with stacks of cracklin' pork rinds, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite snack. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s favorite magazine was `` Human Events,'' a conservative political journal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite is `` Bassmaster,'' a fishing journal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 64, is left-handed. He likes country music, vodka martinis and Mexican food. He jogs several times a week, covering two miles in about 18 minutes. For fun, he races his Cigarette boat off the chilly waters of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He's an avid tennis player and fisherman and also likes to play horseshoes. An Episcopalian, he attends church regularly with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. They've been married 43 years. They have five children, all adults now, and dote on their 10 grandchildren. In 71 days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take over from a popular president who charmed the nation with his easy-going manner, wit and polished communications skills. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> readily acknowledges he's different. `` I may not be the most eloquent, but I learned early that eloquence wo n't draw oil from the ground,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last summer. `` I may sometimes be a little awkward but there's nothing self-conscious in my love of country. I am a quiet man but I hear the quiet people others do n't.'' On another occasion, he said, `` My leadership might not be the most charismatic but I'm not sure that we need a lot of razzle dazzle. There's probably enough drama in the world already.'' Conservatives are worried that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, although he took a hard line during his presidential campaign, will turn into a moderate in the White House. Indeed, his political leanings have drifted over the years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Goldwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 when he was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 when he ran for president and a <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> ever since. `` I suspect that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will want a staff that includes sort of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around him,'' said Republican consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, who once worked for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The difference between the styles of -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is out of an intellectual and political tradition in which the emphasis is on finding the right people in public service, seeking their advice and believing that goals come out of having the right people in the right places,'' said <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considered more pragmatic and issue-oriented than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. As a onetime envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, as well as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a solid foundation in foreign policy. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his first year in office practically ignored foreign policy, devoting his attention to budget and tax cuts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit conference and an early meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a senior fellow in governmental studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is the most hands-off manager of the modern presidency. I suspect that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be not nearly as hands off. ...'' Echoing that theme, <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first political director in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be `` probably more involved in the presidency and the day-to-day operations -LRB- but -RRB- probably not a hell of a lot more. He's not a <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Both <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are known for their attention to detail. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` certainly seems to share <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s disdain for the press. He, too, does n't see being too close to the press as being in his interest.'' Though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to stay the course set by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said `` each president wants to do things differently than the person he succeeds.'' `` What kind of president he'll be will depend largely on things that happen the next four years that are largely out of his control _ whether the Iranians take over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> or something like that,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. `` There are going to be some things that happen in the next four years in which the mettle of the man will have to be assessed.'' On that very point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience recently that the Oval Office was a place for `` the moments that cut through the expected and the everyday and force us, through action, to define ourselves. `` I do n't know what the cutting moments will be for the next president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But I know they'll come. And I know I'm ready.

Marrow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS can invade immature blood cells in the bone marrow and turn them into `` bags of virus'' that may be major reservoirs for the fatal immune deficiency disease, researchers reported in a new study. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Folks </PERSON>, head of a virology laboratory at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said Thursday that the finding confirms that the AIDS virus is able to infect and reproduce within stem cells _ immature cells that grow in the bone marrow and develop into components of the blood. `` This is probably a cell that helps set up the reservoir of infection and allows the disease to become chronic and linger for a long period of time,'' Folks said in a telephone interview. Folks said he and a team of researchers used a new technique to purify stem cells from bone marrow extracted from a cadaver. The stem cells then were exposed to human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS, and then cultured in test tubes. `` After 40 or 50 days, the cells in the culture became packed with HIV virus,'' Folks said. `` The cells became bags of virus.'' The infected cells developed into macrophages, a type of cell that fights disease by engulfing and digesting bacteria or other infective agents. Folks said for people infected with AIDS, macrophages may develop into `` bags of virus'' that actually can spread the infection to other parts of the body. `` It may be that these stem cells get infected with AIDs and then they move to the brain, or the lungs or whereever macrophages might roam,'' Folks said. He said this is speculation, since his study was done only in test tubes, but he said the study did show that macrophages can become so engorged with viruses that the cell finally bursts and the viral products re released. Folks said the virus develops differently in the stem cell than it does in the T-cell, another type of blood cell attacked by HIV. In the T-cell, the virus creates buds on the cell surface. These buds can become a target of antibodies. But in the stem cell, the virus reproduces within the cell wall and there is no clue on the outside that would attract attack by antibodies. For this reason, he said, the bone marrow cells may form a reservoir of disease that would be difficult to attack with a vaccine. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease that can spread by an exchange of body fluids, such as in sexual contact, transfusion by infected blood products, sharing of infected needles or from birthing mother to child. The disease kills by disabling the body's immune system and making it unable to resist other infections. As of Oct. 17, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 75,768 Americans, of whom 42,653 have died since June 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. The study co-authored by Folks will be published Friday in Science, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science. Other co-authors of the study are <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Justement </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> of the the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

 Firefighters on Thursday finally extinguished a blaze that killed 22 people at an oil refinery and burned for more than a day, officials said. Thirty-one people were hospitalized with injuries suffered in the fire that broke out at midday Wednesday and was put out 27 hours later. Twelve of them were listed in critical condition. <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajree </PERSON>, chairman of the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Bharat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said 17 bodies had been identified but five others were too badly burned `` People were seen running naked when the fire began. Everyone in the way was burned,'' he said. <PERSON> Gajree </PERSON> said the cause of the fire had not been determined. `` It could be a cigarette or anything else,'' he said. `` Three loud explosions were heard, but they could have been caused by flammable vapor.'' The fire started at a naphtha tank and spread to two other tanks. K.R.S. <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>, director of the company's refinery division, said the explosion may have occurred in a dispatch unit where trucks are loaded near the naphtha tanks. But two truck drivers who saw the naphtha tanks explode said they thought the explosion originated closer to the tanks. Within seconds, the roof of the first tank blew off, said one of the truckers, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON>. <PERSON> Majid </PERSON>, 28, was hospitalized with burns over 10 percent of his body.

 A man who was on a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner said Thursday the seizure of the plane appeared to have been well-planned but that once the hijackers had the jet, they were thrown into confusion. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murry </PERSON>, an employee of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation company, was the second American witnesses to testify Thursday at the trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who admitted taken part in the June 1985 hijacking. `` The whole thing -LRB- hijacking -RRB- was like a theatrical performance, a well-rehearsed play, in which something had gone wrong, they could not follow the preferred script,'' <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murry </PERSON>, 61, said watching the hijackers `` running up and down the aisle'' of the airplane `` was as if they were n't prepared for an aircraft with a door at the back.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air piracy in the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed, and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days during the ordeal. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has has denied killing the 23-year-old sailor. Earlier Thursday, another former hostage said he feared that someone on the airplane might attempt to overpower the terrorists and cause them to set off a hand grenade they were carrying. `` I had a fear that someone would try to attack the hijackers and they would drop the grenade,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON>, a 40-year-old real estate developer. <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON> also spoke of the brutal beatings of passengers during the hijacking, as have many witnesses since the trial began July 5. `` I heard the beatings and screams in the front of the plane,'' he told the court, saying that at one point `` I feared I would be killed.'' Neither <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> or <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON> said where he was from, under guidelines set by the court to protect witnesses' security.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has been flying a `` Stealth'' radar-evading jet fighter for seven years, and now has about 50 of the planes at an isolated base in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Thursday. Partially lifting a veil of secrecy that has enveloped the plane from its birth, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> released a photograph of the unusual aircraft but declined to discuss its capabilities. The limited disclosures were made now because the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> needs to start flying the craft in daylight, a spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the plane had been declared operational and ready for wartime missions in October 1983, but that it first flew in June 1981. The Stealth fighter `` is officially known as the F-117A,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman. `` It has been operational since October 1983 and is assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> 4450th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Nev. The aircraft is based at the <ORGANIZATION> Tonopah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Test </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.'' The photograph released by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> depicts a relatively small, swept-wing plane with a flat underbelly. It somewhat resembles a sting ray _ black or dark blue with no exterior markings. The cockpit is located far forward in a nose that comes to a sharp point, with what appears to be gun barrels or air-speed probes sticking out. The plane features a `` V'' tail atop a fuselage that ends in a rectangle, apparently completely encompassing the two engines that power the plane. The air intakes for the engines appear to be fitted tightly into the sides of the fuselage, just below the cockpit. The swept-back wings would suggest the plane is capable of flying at supersonic speeds, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss the matter. Military sources have said the plane is designed for sneak ground attacks and not air-to-air dogfighting. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 59 of the planes and 52 of them have been delivered, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Three of the planes have crashed and two pilots have been killed, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> added. To protect its secrecy, the plane has been flown only at night. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> needs to start flying the plane during daylight if it is to integrate the squadron's war plans with other units, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to discuss how much the program cost. Neither would they offer information on the plane's dimensions or general capabilities, the materials from which it was constructed, or the major subcontractors involved The plane is built by the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at a tightly guarded plant in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The very first production model of the plane crashed with a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pilot at the controls, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. That test pilot survived the accident, for which no date was given. The second crash occurred on July 11, 1986, near <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the third on Oct. 14, 1987, at <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the service said. Both pilots were killed. The Stealth fighter is `` a mature system which has enjoyed bipartisan congressional support since its inception -LRB- and -RRB- can now be fully integrated into operational plans in support of world-wide defense commitments,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The spokesman denied the administration was trying to bolster support for Republican defense policies by unveiling the plane. `` In order to move the system further along, they have to start daytime flying,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` That's what driving it. And I think both sides of the aisle on the Hill understand that ...'' According to military sources, the planes are kept at a high state of readiness for use as `` aerial shock troops,'' capable of slipping behind enemy lines without being detected on radar and creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs. The sources said the decision to unveil the plane was prompted in part by the scheduled Nov. 22 unveiling of the B-2 Stealth bomber. The bomber has been built with more recent and advanced technology than the fighter, so there is little reason to continue to hide the fighter, the sources explained. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials also had glumly concluded that even if they wanted to keep the program secret, upcoming court fights were likely to shatter security, the sources continued. Production line workers at the <LOCATION> Lockheed </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> have gone to court with charges they are being sickened by exposure to dangerous chemicals.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> acknowledged Thursday it has only begun to count casualties and damage from the earthquake that devastated its southern border region, and it said the death toll, now at 938, is expected to rise. The official count of those seriously injured rose to more than 2,870, with no count being kept of those with minor injuries. A leading seismologist estimated more than 1,000 were dead and predicted another strong quake will soon hit the same area along the Burmese border. An earthquake measuring 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale shook the southeastern Chinese provinces of <PERSON> Guangxi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhuang </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> on Thursday, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said it was centered off-shore in the <LOCATION> Beibu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and no damage was reported. Seismologists said it may have been an aftershock to the Sunday quake that devastated dozens of remote towns and farming villages in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province, west of <LOCATION> Guangxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zhuang </LOCATION>. That quake measured 7.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. `` Both the number of injured and the death toll are expected to rise as rescue workers reach isolated villages and unearth more bodies,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> issued half a dozen reports on the quake Thursday, acknowledging for the first time the scope of the disaster after days of near silence. It said the quake had `` almost totally destroyed'' a 13-square-mile area. A much larger area suffered lesser damage. In the worst-hit village, <LOCATION> Zhanmapo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said doctors had set up a makeshift open-air hospital because tents had not yet arrived. All 287 dead in the village were buried, it said. `` So far, no infectious diseases have occurred,'' it quoted <PERSON> Zhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fubao </PERSON>, head of the local epidemic prevention station, as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said 707 bodies were recovered in the quake zone, still far below the figure of 938 dead that government officials told <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Aid agencies. The officials also said more than 100,000 people were homeless. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> he estimated more than 1,000 were dead. `` Most of the buildings in the area were built of bamboo and wood, and over 80 percent of them have collapsed,'' he said. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said about 190 aftershocks have hit the same area and predicted that one measuring about 6.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale will hit soon. `` Strong aftershocks will probably last about two months or even longer,'' he said. The Richter scale is a gauge of the strength of an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of 6.0 is capable of causing considerable damage. Each increase of one digit on the scale indicates a tenfold increase in strength. <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> Jian </PERSON>, a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policymaking <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cabinet, arrived at the quake epicenter Thursday afternoon to inspect damage. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said he praised rescue workers for their round-the-clock efforts and promised the party will help quake victims rebuild their homes. Two thousand soldiers `` have been working without sleep or rest, digging victims from the wreckage of collapsed buildings, giving emergency first-aid to the injured, repairing highways, building temporary shelters and delivering food to the survivors,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. More than 75 tons of medicine and 24 tons of food have been sent into the quake area by helicopter, truck and horse-drawn cart, the news agency said. Fuel and building materials also have been brought in. The government told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that it would welcome outside aid.

 An elementary school principal arrested for allegedly buying two vials of crack was vilified Thursday by parents demanding his removal and defended by shocked co-workers as he awaited arraignment on drug charges. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>, 55, the first city principal ever arrested on drug charges, remained on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> payroll following his arrest Wednesday, one week after Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> announced a drug crackdown in schools. `` This is a terribly shocking incident. It's distressing,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON>, head of the 4,600-member <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> and Administrators. <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> said the arrest for criminal possession of a controlled substance was the first drug arrest among his membership. The bust on a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> streetcorner near <LOCATION> Barnwell </LOCATION>'s home sparked angry comments from parents with children attending P.S. 53 in the <LOCATION> Morrisania </LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, while co-workers came to <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>'s defense Parents and school officials charged <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> was frequently late or absent from school. He had been suspended for 10 days in 1975. `` I do n't like everyone talking against my principal,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, a school aide at the elementary school, which has 1,300 pupils. `` If something is wrong, he should be given an opportunity to get himself well.'' Agreed school administrator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannibal </PERSON>: `` This is getting blown out of proportion.'' But <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who has two girls in the fourth grade at the school, demanded <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>'s removal. `` He should have never had the job in the first place,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, standing outside the school with her daughters. `` He was endangering our kids' lives. I'm glad he's not here now.'' <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLoach </PERSON> refused to let her 5-year-old daughter <PERSON> Shamieka </PERSON> inside the school building Thursday. `` I was very angry. I came here this morning and made a lot of noise,'' she said. <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON>, however, called <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>'s arrest an isolated incident which should n't reflect poorly on the rest of the city's school employees. `` While this is terribly disturbing, we have thousands of workers fighting to keep drugs out of the schools and get rid of the problem,'' said <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON>. `` It is not my sense that drug-testing is needed.'' <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>'s record as principal of the school was troubled during his 16-year tenure, school officials said. In 1975, he was suspended for 10 days after covering up for an assistant principal accused of using corporal punishment. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a member of the local school board, said <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> had been taken off the job and temporarily reassigned three other times recently for his `` regular lateness, his absence and his general demeanor.'' Once <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> is arraigned and released, he will be reassigned to the local district office with pay pending completion of legal action, said <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobrino </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 About 20,000 protesters rallied in the streets of the capital Thursday and demanded that President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> resign to pave the way for parliamentary elections. The demonstrators, shouting anti-government slogans, met in five separate rallies to mark the anniversary of a violent campaign launched on Nov. 10, 1987, to topple <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. But political observers say they believe lack of unity among the opposition groups make the removal of the president improbable. Among the organizers of Thursday's rallies were <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, other leftist parties and the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Jamaat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 59, seized power in a March 1982 coup and imposed military law, which was lifted in November 1986 in favor of a civilian government. His <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a parliamentary majority in disputed March 3 elections that were boycotted by the 20 major opposition parties _ including those led by Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> _ that have no vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Parliament earlier this year passed a law making Islam the official religion of this 85 percent Moslem nation, drawing strong protests from opposition politicians, women, students and representative of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> minorities. Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> told a noontime rally of about 5,000 cheering supporters in the city's main square that the 300-seat Parliament must be dissolved in favor of a caretaker government that would organize new elections. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, daughter of slain President <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujibur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, who led <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> after it won independence from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1971, told a rally of about 10,000 supporters: `` We want true democracy and a genuine representative government ... Our campaign against the autocratic rule of <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> is continuing.'' Last year, supporters of Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> joined forces to stage violent street protests and general strikes, but the two groups have since drifted apart. `` We do not want any unity with those who have secret deals with the -LRB- military -RRB- and the government,'' <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> said, referring to Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, whom she has accused of having links with the army. Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Ziaur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, came to power in a military-civilian uprising that toppled the government of <PERSON> Mujibur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>'s father, on Nov. 7, 1975. <PERSON> Ziaur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> was killed in an aborted military coup in May 1981. `` -LRB- The opposition -RRB- is observing the anniversary of their failure,'' <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Moazzem </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossain </PERSON>, secretary general of governing <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told a rally near <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> is to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 16 in which he is expected to speak about the flooding in <LOCATION> Bangaldesh </LOCATION> that killed more than 1,500 people and left 40 million homeless.

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday promised to end the `` reactionary'' legacy of the late President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> if she is elected Nov. 16. `` <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s 11-year rule was replete with floggings, hangings and suppression of democratic people and institutions,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told tens of thousands of cheering supporters, who punctuated her speech in this northeastern city with chants of `` Benazir will rule!'' and `` <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON>, the rising sun!'' The elections for the 217-seat national assembly `` will usher in an era of freedom and prosperity for the people of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told the crowd. `` That will be the end of the <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> legacy.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in an Aug. 17 plane crash that killed 29 other people, including five top army generals and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>. The 35-year-old daughter of the late prime minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who was ousted by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in a 1977 coup and ordered hanged, said the late president's term in office `` was like a dark shadow that has started to lift.'' The national assembly elections, whose winner will become the new prime minister, will be followed on Nov. 19 by voting for the provincial legislative assemblies. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s supporters appear to be so sure of her victory that some of them address her as `` prime minister.'' Her <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> People's Party is pitted against the nine-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> headed by former prime minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>. Thursday's rally was dominated by the memory of the two dead leaders, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> loyalists of having a poor human rights record. Members of the alliance say that <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> committed political murders, jailed his opponents, had them kidnapped and denied a wide range of freedoms during his seven years in office. `` My father gave this nation prosperity, and an honorable place to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in its global ties,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who described <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s government and policies as `` reactionary.'' Just before the rally, several hundred supporters of both parties clashed near a mosque in <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, chanting slogans against each other and throwing rocks. Dozens of armed police officers separated the two groups. No one was injured and there were no arrests. <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, who also was campaigning Thursday, spoke at a rally of his supporters in <LOCATION> Wazirabad </LOCATION>, 110 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>. He asked them `` to ensure security for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Islamic ideology and its geographical frontiers.'' <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, another leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> whose power base is in the province of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, addressed a separate rally in <LOCATION> Fatehjang </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, if elected, would `` establish an exploitation-free and Islamic welfare society to provide inexpensive justice and a respectable living standard to the common people.''

<HEAD>Jury Acquits Man Of Child Abuse In Case Where Wife Went to Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man charged with sexually assaulting his young daughter was acquitted Thursday, nearly 1 -LCB- years after his estranged wife chose jail rather than let him see the child. After the <ORGANIZATION> Rockingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury issued its verdict, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION> said he will seek custody of the girl, now 5 -LCB-, and her 4-year-old brother. `` She's just a little girl, and like other people who got involved with my wife, she got used,'' <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> said. The jury began deliberating late Wednesday, resumed Thursday morning and returned the verdict just before noon. County Attorney <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>, who brought the charge against <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> in March, said he was disappointed with the verdict. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>'s now ex-wife, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, was led from the courtroom by supporters with her head down and left through the back of the courthouse to avoid reporters. A spokeswoman from <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> Rape and Assault Support Services, which has supported Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> since 1986, said the woman `` is in a state of shock.'' `` As far as the criminal justice system goes on this case, it's over,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauth </PERSON>, the agency's program director `` We tried to make the system work. We have a strong belief in the system. We're just disappointed at the outcome.'' In February 1987, Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> went to jail after disobeying a court order to disclose the children's whereabouts. After a week, she was released when she permitted <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> supervised visitation rights. In a divorce hearing in March 1987, a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to back her claims and gave <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> unsupervised visitation. A grand jury a year later indicted <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> on a charge that he sexually assaulted the child after he was given unsupervised visitation rights. During the trial, defense lawyers contended Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> hoped to make up to $ 1.5 million on book and movie rights to her story. She denied the charge. They also said she influenced the daughter, through repeated interrogations, to describe the alleged abuse. The prosecution's first witness was the child. The courtroom was closed and requests to get a transcript of her testimony were rejected. A doctor testified that during a September 1987 examination of the girl he found internal scar tissue he judged to be a `` sexual injury.'' He could not say how or when the injury was inflicted, but doubted the girl caused the injury herself.

But <PERSON> Towne </PERSON> also expressed concern that <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, where jewelry, brass and maritime-related items sell at a premium, might soon be invaded by T-shirt and postcard shops. In fact, since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected vice president, a few T-shirt shops have already opened. `` The merchants have got to be sure the town does n't go to pot. We do n't want any honky-tonks,'' <PERSON> Towne </PERSON> declared. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, a member of the town's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION>, said there is also concern about the effect of tourist traffic on the town. Already the narrow, two-lane streets are clogged daily between May and September. Ocean Avenue, the winding, thin road where the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family lives, is often lined with cars bearing people who sit and stare by the hour at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> estate. Many locals say they fear those crowds will grow. `` I'm a little leery because I do n't know what costs the town will incur,'' <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> said. `` Every bus tour that comes into southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> will swing into town. `` But, still,'' she added, `` there's a sense of pride in him, a feeling it's our town that could be the center of attention.'' Earlier this year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would forego <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> as his vacation retreat if the town and its residents would suffer by his presence.

County Republican Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweezy </PERSON> said the vacancy came up during discussions with <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> about the future of the state party after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> becomes vice president. <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> took along his longtime political aide <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melchert </PERSON> when he met with <PERSON> Sweezy </PERSON>. The mayor declined to comment on the meeting. The discussion `` was about politics.

 Vandals painted swastikas and anti-Semitic slurs at a Jewish cemetery in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and in the office of a Jewish student organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> one day after a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht. `` I ca n't even find the word for it, it's so hurtful,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheim </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Thursday. There was no sign of forced entry at the office and sanctuary in the basement of the student union, <PERSON> Oppenheim </PERSON> said. The group has about 200 students that coordinate activities on the campus, which has about 5,000 Jewish students. `` I think it's politically motivated because they did n't do any damage that we can see,'' <PERSON> Oppenheim </PERSON> said. Police were taking fingerprints in the rooms but had no suspects, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, vice president of student affairs. On Wednesday night the Jewish group sponsored a candlelight vigil to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> began their first organized assaults against the Jews in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Woonsocket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, vandals painted swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans at a 95-year-old Jewish cemetery, but police were uncertain whether the attack was related to Kristallnacht observances. A woman visiting B'nai <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Cemetery Tuesday found her son's headstone among the approximately half-dozen covered with swastikas and other Nazi symbols The main road to the cemetery also had been inscribed with anti-Jewish slogans and the German word for Jew, `` <PERSON> Juden </PERSON>.'' `` Today when I went to the cemetery, it was a very terrible reminder of things that have happened to us in the past,'' Temple B'nai <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittes </PERSON> told those assembled for a Kristallnacht memorial service. In addition to the Nazi symbols, there were other images with possible links to Satanic worship, such as skulls and an inverted cross with its arms turned down. `` The sickness that made <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> possible is alive and well today, in our own community,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernikoff </PERSON>.

 Former Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a World War II <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hero who is chiefly remembered for his role in the Watergate scandal, will be buried in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> with full military honors. The funeral Saturday at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION>, a very private man, will be public but the burial will be in the presence only of relatives and close friends. The office of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did not know whether the former president would attend the service. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s friend, law partner and campaign manager in the successful 1968 and 1972 presidential campaigns. The 75-year-old <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> died after suffering a heart attack Wednesday near his home in the <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardian </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general under <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and a co-defendant at the Watergate coverup trial, called him `` one of the most brilliant men I've ever known.'' `` He had a dry sense of humor, very considerate, a very kind man,'' <PERSON> Mardian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mardian </PERSON> was one of five men tried for conspiring to cover up White House involvement in the burglary of Democratic national headquarters in the Watergate Office Building. The burglars were agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Re-Elect the President, which <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> headed. One of the five, lawyer <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, was acquitted, and <PERSON> Mardian </PERSON>'s conviction was overturned on appeal. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> served 19 months in a federal prison, although five of them were spent outside on medical furloughs. Former <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> chief of staff H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> and domestic counselor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> each seved 18 months. <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, declined Thursday to comment on <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s death.

In World War II, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was commander of the PT boat squadron in which <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> served as a lieutenant. He was awarded two Purple Hearts for combat wounds and also won the Silver Star, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s highest decorations. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> began his relationship with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> when their two law firms merged in 1967 and, although a year younger, became <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s mentor They remained friends even though <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> once suggested, in a taped <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conversation, that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> take the whole rap for the Watergate coverup. As attorney general, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> loosened wiretap restrictions and submitted an anti-crime package to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that included pretrial detention of those considered likely to commit further crimes if freed on bail. He was considered the force behind a bill that would have permitted the 1965 Voting Rights Act to expire. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Sept. 15, 1913.

 Conservative Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> won a cliffhanger <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race Thursday over Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, a moderate Democrat, for the seat being relinquished by Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s narrow victory, based on absentee ballots still being counted, decided the last of this year's 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races. It means the Democrats will have a 55-45 majority, a gain of one seat, in the new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But while <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> claimed victory, <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> did not immediately concede and his campaign manager said there might be a legal challenge because of what he called irregularities in some vote totals. `` I think at this point the numbers are conclusive,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. `` It's very exciting. `` I do n't know the exact word to use ... There's been a great deal of anxiety. It's been long, it's been tough, but I felt all along that my message of more freedom; free markets, freedom from taxes, freedom as an objective of our foreign policy, would come through clearly,'' said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, 48-year-old grandson of the Baseball Hall of Fame manager. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s latest tally showed <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> with 2,044,575 votes, or 50 percent, to <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>'s 2,014,924 votes, also 50 percent. That gave <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> a margin of nearly 30,000 votes, more than enough to avoid the automatic recount that would be triggered if the difference was less than about 20,000. About 5,000 absentee votes still were out in <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> stronghold in the Panhandle. Campaign Manager <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, who remained at his home in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>'s historic district, planned a conference call with legal counsel to discuss taking the election to court, as Farmer recommended. `` We may have to ask the fat lady for an encore,'' <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. `` Something's screwy with those numbers.'' Farmer said that the way races were listed on the ballots may have confused voters in some counties. He cited three counties where more votes were cast for president than <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the difference was nearly 60,000; <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where it was nearly 52,000; and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, nearly 49,000. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got more votes in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> than <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>? C'mon, now,'' <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said by telephone. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, 55, was doing some gardening, and also had told his staff he would be praying and reading poetry until the results were known. He told staffers he had taken a risk, as is sometimes necessary in life, and fallen short. While his political career might be ending, <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said, he would remain in public service. As 3.9 million votes filtered in election night, exit polls were enough for the three major television networks to declare MacKay the winner. But <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> moved ahead Wednesday as partial results from 134,000 absentee ballots came in. The absentee ballots have traditionally favored Republicans in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year had a special drive to register supporters likely to vote by absentee ballot. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a former bank president, and <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, a lawyer who's been one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s most-praised politicians for two decades, both were elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, during 12 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, seven times was honored as the `` most valuable legislator,'' and he dominated newspaper endorsements this year in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary and the general election.

 More than 150 writers, professionals and community activists signed a newspaper advertisement Thursday expressing regret at the departure of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> as editor of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. And a top political correspondent for the newspapers resigned in protest over <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s departure. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> before he joined the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> papers in 1986, resigned Nov. 4, citing irreconcilable differences with the newspapers' management. He had said he wanted to make the newspapers a `` world-class'' operation, and his departure stunned the staff. Newsroom employees also had on Saturday signed a full-page ad supporting <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>. Novelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> native and vocal supporter of changes made during <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s tenure, helped organize Thursday's advertisement, which also announced a march for Saturday He said the 152 people who signed the ad paid its $ 8,200 cost. `` We greatly appreciate the kind of excellence Mr. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> strove for and helped to produce, and we are concerned that the ready acceptance of his resignation signals a compromise of the high journalistic standards we have come to expect,'' the advertisement said. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> people are saying is that they hold great journalism in contempt ... that they celebrate mediocrity and mediocrity only,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> publishes the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> papers and others across the country. Publisher <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did not return calls seeking comment Thursday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based political correspondent, resigned Wednesday, newspaper officials said. <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON> was on the panel for the first of the two televised debates between presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> that he left because of the <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> matter, adding, `` We were on the way to building something great.

<HEAD>Administration Asked To Enforce Labor Rights Clause In Trade Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The administration should enforce a provision in the new trade law that allows it to restrict imports from a country which refuses to grant organizing rights to workers, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` In <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> they shoot people who want to organize labor,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director of economics, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. He apparently was referring to the shooting in 1987 of a provincial union official, <PERSON> Yod </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaeksawat </PERSON>. No link to an employer has been proved in that case, but there have been many instances of intimidation of labor organizers in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, including threats to life, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Asian-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> affiliate. At the Thai embassy, Counselor <PERSON> Pradap </PERSON> <PERSON> Pibulsongram </PERSON>, said `` The Thai government recognizes worker rights. Of course there are abuses in any country, but our government does not condone them.'' <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON> said that enforcing the labor rights provision of the trade law `` does n't mean that we have to stop imports. It does mean you have to allow the same rights of organization and bargaining that we have had.'' Before passage of the new law, denial of labor rights had already been the ground for denying some countries _ including <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ the right to ship some goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without payment of duty. Hearings have been scheduled for next week on adding others to the list. Under the new law, the president can designate an offending country as engaging in an unfair labor practice and take further action against its trade. The law also sets the goal of obtaining an international agreement on labor rights.

 <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s newest senator, was born into fame and politics, but he adopted his conservative Republican viewpoints on his own. He took the nickname of grandfather <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON>, beloved and successful owner and manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> baseball team and now in baseball's Hall of Fame. His maternal grandfather, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, and his step-grandfather, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>, had both served as Democratic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s family moved in 1951 from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which in the 1970s would become one of the nation's fastest-growing areas and a conservative Republican stronghold in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, now 48, followed a Ronald Reagan-like evolution from liberal Democrat. He was the first president of the <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, then switched parties in 1979 as he was rising to become a bank president in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION>.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday temporarily blocked deep cuts in auto insurance rates mandated by voters, but the measure's author said insurance companies ca n't thwart the will of the people Legislative leaders might ask Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> to call a special emergency session to deal with the uproar over the rate-slashing measure, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON>. `` The voters have spoken and they expect the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to implement Proposition 103,'' the leaders said in a draft of a letter to the governor. Proposition 103 forces insurance companies to reduce rates for most liability policies, including those for cars, homes and businesses, 20 percent below November 1987 rates. The rollback would be effective when current policies are renewed. The measure, backed by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, reduces premiums by an additional 20 percent for motorists with clean driving records and freezes premiums at those lower rates for at least two years. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters narrowly approved the initiative Tuesday, while rejecting four other insurance measures sponsored by insurers and trial lawyers. In response to three insurance company lawsuits claiming the measure is unconstitutional, the high court issued an order signed by six of seven justices staying Proposition 103 indefinitely to allow time for consideration of the measure. Nearly 50 insurance companies responded to the voter revolt against skyrocketing rates by announcing they would stop writing certain policies in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. At least six other insurance companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Casualty and Fireman's <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, said they have withdrawn or intend to withdraw from the auto insurance business in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We're finding exactly what we feared, and that is there's no marketplace left as a result of the passage of Proposition 103,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, executive director of the Pasadena-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a 600-member association of independent insurance brokers and agents. `` The rate rollbacks that are contained in 103 will require insurance companies to sell their products at a loss,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tye </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>. `` For any business, that kind of situation creates total havoc. That's one of the points on which we're challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 103,'' <PERSON> Tye </PERSON> said. But Proposition 103 author <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said, `` It's clear that insurance companies are now trying to shift the battle to the courts to thwart the will of the people when they lost the battle -LRB- in the election -RRB-.'' `` Last week, the same insurance companies were claiming the courts were at fault for high insurance rates. Our feeling is that the courts should look at this thing very carefully. We intend to intervene on behalf of all the voters. I doubt very much if the courts are going to overturn the will of the people,'' <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, a Democrat who chairs the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> insurance committee, agreed that the rate rollbacks must go into effect. `` The bottom line is the insurance companies are going to have to learn to live with the rate cut sooner or later. This -LRB- legal challenge -RRB- just postpones the inevitable,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. Proposition 103 was approved despite the insurance industry's $ 60 million campaign seeking its defeat and passage of its own measures. It was the nation's most costly state political campaign ever. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> officials said consumers need not panic about whether they will be able to renew policies or obtain new ones. `` It's premature to say what is going to happen because there are 650 or 700 firms writing property-casualty business in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, who is appointed by the governor. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s insurance market is the nation's largest. Its auto insurance rates are the nation's third highest on average, after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Insurers blame the rates on huge damage awards in court cases and the state's high medical costs.

<HEAD>EPA Finds 500 Chemicals In Air Samples At 10 Public Buildings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its sampling of the indoor air in 10 public buildings around the country turned up traces of more than 500 different chemicals. Though the concentrations were generally small, sometimes they reached 100 times the levels found in typical outdoor air, the agency said. `` No one knows what the health effects are at those concentrations,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, the agency's spokesman on air pollution. The agency released a report on its surveys of indoor air in 1983 through 1987 in 10 buildings around the country, together with a pamphlet of advice for homeowners on indoor air quality problems. The pamphlet generally advises homeowners to try to get rid of the sources of air pollutants indoors, such as stopping smoking; to use judicious ventilation such as kitchen exhaust fans; and not to keep unused products that might give off contaminants, such as leftover paints and aerosols. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has published pamphlets on particular indoor polluants before, such as radon gas, but never on the general subject as a whole. A new office building in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` had the highest concentrations for most of the volatile'' compounds, the report said. `` However, by the third trip, most of the compounds had decreased considerably.'' The office building air was checked just after the building was completed in 1983, one month later, and five months later. For example, the median concentration of a common solvent, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, dropped from 290 micrograms per cubic meter of air just after completion to 40 micrograms five months later. `` Many of the volatile organics many originate from cleaning agents'' and pesticides, the study suggested. Such chemicals have attracted increasing attention in recent years as a source of `` sick building syndrome,'' responsible for flu-like episodes among employees. EPA itself is the subject of a union complaint about chemicals given off by new carpets in a section of the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters. Besides the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> office building, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> surveyed two homes for the elderly, a public school and office building in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; a hospital and an associated nursing home in <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; an office building in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a nursing home in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and an office-and-classroom building at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>

<HEAD>President OKs Back Benefits for Man Who Joined WWII Navy at Age 12</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Thursday granting a World War II veteran injured at <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> the disability benefits he was denied by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> because he lied about his age when he enlisted at age 12. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> `` is a veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> service who has honorably served his country.'' Te act provides that dental injuries <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> suffered at the Battle of <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> will be considered a permanent service-connected disability incurred in the line of duty. It also provides for reimbursement for costs for treatment. The measure also grants <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> a lump-sum payment of $ 4,917 in back pay for the period from Sept. 17, 1942, to April 5, 1943, when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> discovered his age and he was mustered out. He'll also get mustering out pay and interest. The battle at <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION>, one of the southern <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, was a series of land and sea engagements between Allied and Japanese forces between August 1942 and February 1943. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was aboard the USS South Dakota when shrapnel ripped through his mouth. He contended he lost all his teeth, but was denied mustering out benefits and was granted disability status for only one tooth. The legislation gives him $ 18,000 for his mouth injury, in addition to the mustering out and back pay. He would have received $ 337 in 1943 when discharged, but Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, insisted that the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> veteran be compensated in 1988 dollars with interest. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, testified on <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s behalf at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, and the bill was passed in the most recent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s long quest to gain his disability benefits got a boost when he became the subject of a recent <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television movie, `` Too Young the Hero.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty Thursday to three counts of mischarging the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on a $ 9.2 million contract and agreed to pay $ 810,600 in fines and other penalties. The action presented for the first time Thursday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court involved mischarges and misallocation of labor charges stemming from a five-year computer software contract between <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a predecessor of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Korn </PERSON>. Under the plea agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was assessed $ 250,000 in criminal penalties, $ 250,000 in civil restitution, $ 250,000 in civil double damages, $ 60,000 as full payment for the government's investigative costs and $ 600 in special assessments The improper activities occurred at <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION>'s Technical Services Division office in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, the government and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said the local manager directed employees to charge the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for work done under one delivery order to a subsequent order. When the company reached the spending ceiling on a given order, it should have stopped work or asked the Army whether to stop or finish, and for additional money, <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said. `` They never did that,'' <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said, saying the motive was the need to avoid exceeding estimated costs to keep getting the contract renewed annually. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendry </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> vice president and general counsel, pleaded guilty on the company's behalf to three felony false-claims charges in which it misallocated labor charges totaling $ 250,000 in 1985, 1986 and early 1987. <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said the mischarging amounted to overcharging `` in the sense that they did n't ask for more money and went and spent it anyway.'' The case was presented to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilby </PERSON> following a 1 -LCB- - year investigation

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other Democratic leaders said Thursday they will back Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, for the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The endorsement all but guarantees that the 72-year-old <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 27-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, will take over the committee at a critical time: during the debate over a taxpayer bailout of the fund that insures the nation's savings institutions. The current chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, lost his re-election bid Tuesday after his opponent made a campaign issue out of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> allegations that <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> accepted thousands of dollars in entertainment from savings industry lobbyists. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, at a news conference, said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders met Thursday afternoon and unanimously decided to support <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>'s replacement when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> meets on Dec. 6. `` The <ORGANIZATION> united </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> position </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership is that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> deserves that opportunity, is well-qualified and will be a fine chairman,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a fellow Texan. Others at the leadership meeting were <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Deputy Whip <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> is also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and had been mentioned as a possible alternative to <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. Some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have been reluctant to support <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who has a reputation as a maverick and has been more involved in housing issues than in mainstream banking issues. Also, they favored a chairman representing a home district with a less direct interest in the resolution of the savings and loan crisis. The industry's worst losses are concentrated in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has said he favors an immediate $ 50 billion expenditure from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> as the most effective and least costly solution in the long run. Other Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expressing an interest in the job were Reps. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Falce </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> also was mentioned as a possibility. However, <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said they would only accept the position if <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> did n't get it and aides for the others said they were unlikely to buck the leadership. The other big question facing the committee next year will be the proposed relaxation of barriers between the banking and securities industries. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has approached the issue cautiously, expressing skepticism about deregulating too quickly.

<HEAD>Britain and Iran Resume Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> restored full diplomatic relations Thursday, renewing hopes for the release of British hostages held by pro-Iranian Islamic extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Relations between the two countries soured in May 1987 after an Iranian envoy was arrested on shoplifting charges in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and a British diplomat was assaulted by militants in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The Foreign Office announced the resumption of ties Thursday following talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> between Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, assistant undersecretary of state for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, and Dr. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaezi </PERSON>, director general of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Basti </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the sole Iranian diplomat here during the breakdown in ties, hinted that the thaw between the two nations could speed the release of three British hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Speaking in a radio interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Basti </PERSON> said the hostage issue had not come up in negotiations. But he added: `` If you are trying to imply that the new relationship between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> may contribute to that end, I'm not going to deny that.'' Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, whose envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in January 1987 while trying to negotiate freedom for two American hostages, said: `` Certainly this can not do any harm. We must wait and see. This is welcome news. After all the purpose of this diplomacy is to make it easy for governments to talk to each other.'' Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> there was `` no bargain or secret agenda.'' But he said the thaw in relations enabled <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` more effectively to press the case at every opportunity for the Iranians to use all the influence they have got to secure the release of hostages.'' `` Whether that will produce an improvement in the position of the hostages I can not say,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to raise false hopes.'' In June 1987, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> withdrew its diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, closed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s consulate in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and cut its <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> embassy staff to one. Three months later, an Iranian attack on a British tanker in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> prompted <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to close the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office from which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was running a worldwide arms-purchasing operation for its war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> statement Thursday said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had decided to resume full diplomatic representation `` with immediate effect based on reciprocity, mutual respect and non-interference in each others' affairs.'' A diplomatic source in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in each country to assume posts over the next several months. He said an application had been made to Iranian authorities for a visa for <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirie </PERSON>, a 51-year-old diplomat, who would become <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s temporary charge d'affaires. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would have a charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> within a few weeks, and an exchange of ambassadors `` within hopefully six months of that.'' British officials said the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> consulate could resume activity but would not regain extraterritorial status, and the arms procurement office would remain shut. Fourteen foreigners _ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian _ are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Longest held is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted in March 1985. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, who holds both <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> nationality, disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> April 11, 1986, and British television journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> disappeared six days later.

 Thousands of anti-government demonstrators defied curfews in the Sinhalese heartland Thursday and soldiers opened fire, killing at least 15, a military spokesman said. Thirty people were injured, including three soldiers, said the spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules. He said the injured soldiers were hit by rocks and bottles. Soldiers and armored cars stood guard in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital, as three Sinhalese politicians declared their candidacies for president of this island off southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has been plagued by five years of ethnic civil war. More than 8,500 people have been killed in a Tamil insurrection that began in 1983 and extremist anti-government have sprung up among the majority Sinhalese. Militants in the Tamil minority, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> ethnic group making up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, are fighting for a separate homeland because of alleged discrimination in jobs and education. Sinhalese control the government, military and judiciary. Most Sinhalese are Buddhists and they constitute 75 percent of the population. No demonstrations were reported in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, where troops patrolled the streets. But demonstrators in three southern districts defied around-the-clock curfews and marched through the streets demanding President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> and his government step down before the Dec. 19 presidential elections. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> is not running for re-election, but Sinhalese extremists claim his government is incapable of conducting fair elections. The military spokesman said at least five people were killed in each of the three districts: <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>, a coastal town 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tissmaharama </LOCATION>, near the coast 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Monaragala </LOCATION>, an inland town 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Tissmaharama </LOCATION>. The army shootings were the first reported instances of soldiers using the shoot-on-sight orders issued Wednesday to prevent anti-government demonstrations. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, soldiers in armored cars blocked streets leading to the town hall where nomination papers were presented for next month's presidential election. About 1,000 armed policemen stood guard. Dozens of bodyguards, some wearing bulletproof vests, surrounded the three candidates: former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; Minister <PERSON> Ramasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, the candidate of <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonesekera </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a three-party coalition. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese group, is at the vanguard of the anti-government protests. It stepped up its opposition to <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> on Monday by launching a four-day strike that has shut down businesses and transportation across much of the island, caused shortages of fuel and food and prompted thousands of foreign tourists to cut short their vacations. At least 9,000 tourists, mostly from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, were evacuated from beach resorts south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Tuesday after their hotels received warnings from the front to close their doors or face attacks. The government has blamed the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the deaths of at least 550 people, mostly Sinhalese supporters of the government, in the last 15 months. The front opposes <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s peace overtures to guerrillas from the Tamil ethnic minority. Under an Indian-brokered accord signed July 29, 1987, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> offered Tamils a measure of autonomy if the guerrillas surrendered their weapons. The most powerful Tamil groups rejected the accord and have continued their attacks on civilians as well as on an Indian peacekeeping force sent to implement the accord.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has declined to seek civil fines from Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, for filing allegedly faulty financial disclosure reports, a spokesman said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was soundly defeated Tuesday in his bid for a 15th term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a race that political observers said was affected by continuing controversy over his ethics. Justice spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that after a five-month review by the department's Civil Division, `` the determination has been made not to bring a lawsuit under the civil penalty provisions of the financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics in Government Act.'' She declined to specify why the division reached that decision. The Civil Division's review of the case, not previously disclosed to the public, began late last May just after the department's Criminal Division announced that it would not bring criminal charges against <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly failing to disclose that he had accepted meals and entertainment from savings and loan industry lobbyists The Ethics in Government Act imposes a $ 5,000 civil fine on anyone who knowingly and willfully falsifies or fails to file required financial disclosure forms. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has brought four such civil suits in the past. It has filed only one criminal case, resulting in the conviction of former Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, under the disclosure provisions of the act. The Civil Division routinely considers whether to file a civil suit after disclosure cases have been reviewed by the Criminal Division. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the civil division had reviewed the reporting practices of other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee chairmen as part of its consideration of the <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> case. She said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a summer law clerk in the Civil Division's federal programs branch, had been assigned to `` conduct a sampling of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> disclosure forms to determine what the practices were in terms of reporting.'' She said <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> pulled copies last July of at least 100 forms, including all <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairmen for each year back through 1984 and some subcommittee chairmen. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>'s search has been erroneously attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in some published reports. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, the first <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman to be defeated at the polls since <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> voters turned out <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> in 1960, was defeated by <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Machtley </PERSON>, a 40-year-old lawyer from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> and political neophyte. Eight days before the election, a federal court here unsealed portions of a letter sent on May 31 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, acting Justice Criminal Division chief, to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>'s letter referred for commitee review evidence gathered by the department and said, `` Substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct'' on the part of <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> had been found during the Justice probe. The day after the election, <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> was hospitalized at <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with a skin infection on his leg. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said Thursday the congressman's release would depend on his response to medication and the outcome of certain tests

<HEAD>Wright Won't Prejudge Bush's `Flexible Freeze' Concept</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Thursday he's not sure what President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> means by his `` flexible freeze'' idea to cut the federal budget deficit, but he will keep an open mind when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> comes to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with details of the proposal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advanced the flexible freeze concept during the presidential election campaign as an answer to how the nation can meet its financial obligations while cutting the tide of red ink. He said he would limit spending on all programs except Social Security to 4 percent or the rate of inflation. The concept drew reactions ranging from ridicule to curiosity in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which will have to find a way of saving about $ 32 billion next year to meet the target specified by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act. `` I'm not sure I understand exactly what those two words define,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said when asked about the flexible freeze concept. He said if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> means that total federal spending growth will be limited to the amount of inflation and that budget pie then will be divided according to an agreement reached by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration, `` then that is one part of a solution.'' `` It is n't a total solution, because obviously the amount we have been spending in the past has exceeded the amount the government takes in revenue,'' he added. That alone would n't lead to a balanced budget, he said. `` I have an open mind, and I'm willing to listen to the president's refinement of exactly how he interprets the meaning of that phrase.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made his comments to reporters following a meeting at which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership began mapping strategy for the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes in January. Asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can achieve the necessary deficit reduction without breaking his `` read my lips'' pledge not to raise taxes, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said: `` That is a difficult question. I suppose he must have in his mind some proposal, and I eagerly await it.'' But he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-repeated, anti-tax pledge did not amount to a mandate from the voters. `` I do n't think the mandate is so strong for any of the specific things the president-elect has said.'' The first signal about whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is serious about attacking the deficit may well come from whom he appoints as his two members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a bipartisan group constituted last year to craft a politically palatable solution to the budget crisis. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized the commission during the campaign as a device to push a tax increase, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the two appointments to which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is entitled will speak louder. `` Will they be pragmatic people? Will they be realistic people? Will they be people dedicated to finding a true solution to this enormous budget crisis?'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` Will they be people who want us to pay as we go? I think that may be his first signal. But we'll await that signal.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> repeatedly refused to offer his own view on how to make the needed savings, saying proposing a new budget will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prerogative `` I owe it to him not to prejudge or pre-empt him, but wait patiently for the program he will offer,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he hoped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` truly desires a gentler, kinder climate of public discourse, civil debate. ... I shall not be the first to break that truce.'' If there is a mandate in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election and the bolstering of Democratic control of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, it is for both `` to continue and build upon the constructive program that we embarked upon last year and the year before.''

 A federal administrative judge ruled Thursday that stiff landing fees aimed at keeping smaller aircraft out of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> violate federal aviation law because they are discriminatory and unfair. A final decision on how to deal with the fee structure imposed last summer by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> rests with the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, to whom administrative law judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolko </PERSON> made his recommendations. The case has been seen within the aviation industry as a test over how much power the federal government intends to allow local officials and airport operators in dealing with air traffic congestion. A DOT spokesman said the department will decide by Dec. 17 whether to uphold <PERSON> Kolko </PERSON>'s decision or come down with an alternative finding on the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> airport fees, which have raised a storm of protests among private and business pilots and in the commuter airline industry. <PERSON> Kolko </PERSON> in his decision said the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> fees `` are lacking in economic justification ... not fair and reasonable -LRB- and -RRB- are unjustly discriminatory'' toward private aircraft and smaller commuter planes. The judge said that <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> officials acted in violation of federal aviation laws and he concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has legal grounds on which to take pre-emptive action to have the fees revoked. <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> officials said that since the fee structure has been in place, <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> has handled more passengers with fewer delays. `` It is unsettling then, that all the benefits ... could be dismantled if <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> accepts the recommendations issued today,'' the company said. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced last summer that it planned to closely examine the so-called `` Pace Program'' enacted at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> to curtail the volume of air traffic in and out of the busy <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> airport. After loud protests from private pilots and some commuter airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> included in its DOT appropriations legislation earlier this year a provision ordering the department to stop airport construction money for <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> if it concludes the fees violate aviation law and are not rescinded. <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> approved the higher landing fees for small aircraft last March, saying <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>'s capacity `` is a finite resource, which must be managed wisely and efficiently in order to keep people moving with a minimum of delay.'' The airport's operators said they wanted to use <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>'s limited capacity for airliner traffic and not private aircraft, maintaining that a large jetliner with up to 400 people aboard `` deserves a higher priority than a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> with two people on board.'' The new fee structure went into effect in July after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge ruled that the fees were not discriminatory. The higher fees have affected both private pilots and commuter airlines. The government said some commuter services were discontinued to <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> after the new fees went into effect, but that most commuters just passed the higher costs on to air travelers. While the conclusion Thursday by <PERSON> Kolko </PERSON> is little more than a recommendation to senior department officials on whether to take administrative action, it was hailed by private pilot groups and other critics of the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> fees. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called the law judge's decision `` well reasoned'' and said, `` It makes it clear once and for all this country has a national aviation system that must be regulated by appropriate federal authority.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said his group now `` looks forward to.. the final determination'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> fees by Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> next month `` The entire aviation community was gratified'' by <PERSON> Kolko </PERSON>'s findings, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group that represents builders of small aircraft

 An explosion in an underground sewerage tunnel Thursday killed three workers who fled when methane gas built up, but then returned to check the gas level. The deaths were the fourth, fifth and sixth fatalities in four deadly accidents on the tunnel project. The contractor in March was cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for unsafe conditions, including poor ventilation. Rescue crews were hampered by high levels of methane in the tunnel under construction 40 feet below ground, and special equipment had to be brought in to remove the gas and pump fresh air into the search area, said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Luedke </PERSON>. The bodies of two workers were found about 2 p.m., five hours after the explosion or explosions, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, corporate safety director for project contractor <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The third was found a short time later. `` One of them was a real good friend of mine,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said, his voice quivering. The company identified the victims as <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohne </PERSON>, of Big <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a tunnel superintendent; <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sturgeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a shift foreman; and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sochacki </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a safety officer. All were believed to be in their 30s or 40s. After the explosion, two rescue crews moved about 1,200 feet into the tunnel, but they turned back on detecting methane levels of 6 percent, said <PERSON> Luedke </PERSON>, who heads the department's tunnel rescue unit. Any reading above 4 percent is considered dangerous, he said. They returned when fresh air was pumped in and discovered the bodies. The dead workers were trapped approximately 2,000 feet into the tunnel, said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Doig </PERSON>, project manager for <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healy </ORGANIZATION>, said 10 men were in the tunnel when a monitoring device showed high levels of methane. All of the men left the tunnel, he said, and then three men went back in to check gas levels. That was when the explosion occurred, he said. The three had hand-held methane detectors, but it was not known immediately whether they had breathing equipment with them, he added. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said he believed the methane that caused the explosion was naturally occurring, from decayed organic matter. The collector sewer near the accident site had been evacuated repeatedly in the last week because of unsafe levels of methane, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a resident engineer with the sewerage district program. <PERSON> S.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, of <PERSON> McCook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, which is building the sewer under contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, was cited March 17 by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> called the violation serious and the company was fined $ 620 for not providing adequate ventilation in part of a tunnel and for failing to ground electrical equipment. Three workers were killed in the tunnel prior to Thursday, giving <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> the worst fatality record in the nation per dollar spent on a deep tunnel project, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. One man was crushed to death in a conveyor system, another was struck in the head by a falling rock and the third fell 156 feet from a cage to the bottom of a tunnel air shaft. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has had 10 fatalities on its deep tunnel project and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> has had three, <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said. But both projects are further along in contruction, he noted. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the tunnel construction is part of a $ 2.1 billion project that will expand sewage collection and treatment of waste.

<HEAD>Three House Contests Undecided But Leaning 2-1 to the Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The makeup of next year's <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remained in doubt Thursday, with three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> still undecided. Democrats had the lead in two of the contests, but recounts wo n't be finished until later this month. Regardless of the outcome, Democrats will keep a solid hold on the 435-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with a definite 259 seats to the Republicans' certain 173 If the 2-1 split in the undecided House seats holds, the Democrats will have picked up four seats between the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that adjourned last month and the 101st session that begins in January. While some 98 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents seeking re-election were victorious, all three of those trailing in the undecided contests were incumbents. In serious trouble in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 4th Congressional District, was Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, a 20-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whose ties to the defense industry have come under scrutiny. With absentee ballots tallied, <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> finished 727 votes behind lawyer <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the district that stretches from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> past <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Final unofficial results gave <PERSON> James </PERSON> 125,394 votes to 124,667 for <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, leaving his only hope a recount. Under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law, this is required if the margin of difference between the candidates is less than one-half of 1 percent. Five of the six counties in the district began recounting ballots Thursday afternoon and expected to finish Thursday night, but <ORGANIZATION> Flagler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said the recount in her county would not begin until Monday morning. `` Unless there is some kind of gross error, I would expect it to remain the same and I expect to be the congressman,'' said the 47-year <PERSON> James </PERSON>, an attorney and real estate agent. `` If the counters did their job, I'm the winner.'' <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, 66, has not commented on the race since late Tuesday. The congressman has been chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defense appropriations subcommittee that oversees billions of dollars each year in defense spending. Although he has not been accused of any crimes or indicted, published reports have linked him to a federal investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement practices. Armtec, a small defense contractor he brought to <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION>, was raided by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> last summer as part of the federal investigation. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Democrat <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON>, making her first run for political office, led two-term Republican Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> by 2,594 votes with 95 percent of the voting machines and about a third of the absentee ballots tallied. The unofficial count in the 20th Congressional District gave <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON> 92,663 votes to 90,069 for <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON>, 51, who served as an assistant <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, declared victory Tuesday night, but <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, 48, refused to concede, although he said it would be `` an uphill battle'' to overcome her lead. He said he owed it to his supporters to get a full count and would allow a recount to go ahead until the numbers proved his loss beyond a doubt. Board of Elections officials said the entire process could take two weeks. The Democrats also were ahead in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where challenger <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopetski </PERSON> was separated from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in the 5th Congressional District by 1,304 votes. With absentee ballots still to be counted in two counties, <PERSON> Kopetski </PERSON> tallied 104,038, compared to 102,734 for <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Officials in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said they should complete counting of absentee ballots Thursday. <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, with about 16,000 absentees, is not expected to complete its count until late Friday. Neither <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a four-term incumbent, nor <PERSON> Kopetski </PERSON>, a state representative, has declared victory. `` Obviously, we're not very happy where we're sitting,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s campaign manager.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> put up $ 7 million conditionally to enable the sole supplier of a key material used in the space shuttle and some defense rockets to reopen a plant Thursday, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said the money will either get <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> back on its feet or give the space agency the rights to an Avtex rayon fiber needed in the space shuttle and other rockets. If Avtex can demonstrate by Nov. 18 that it will get enough other contracts to keep its Front Royal plant in business, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will then take out an $ 11 million contract for enough of the fiber for 12 shuttle launches, said <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` I do n't look at it as a bailout, because every time we give them something, they give us something in return,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` We're not in the bailout business.'' One week ago, Avtex abruptly shut down all production at its aging mill in Front Royal, citing stiff foreign competition for its other products and environmental regulations that have led to numerous pollution problems. The sudden announcement sent <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> scrambling to determine the impact on the shuttle and an array of military missiles that use <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON>'s carbonizable rayon fiber to form rocket nozzles. Avtex is the only company certified to produce the fiber. Aerospace contractors met last week in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with Avtex to look for a solution. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials met Monday with Avtex officials at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. After <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> pays Avtex the initial $ 7 million, `` They transfer the rights to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> as well as the cookbook to making this rayon fiber to our technical specifications,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Before <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will give the <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forge </ORGANIZATION>, Pa.-based Avtex the $ 11 million contract for 1.1 million pounds of the fiber, <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> will have to show that it can find other contracts to make itself solvent, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` They have to come up with others,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` We are not doing the whole thing by any means.'' By Wednesday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was confident enough that a deal would be reached that he told the <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> plant's 1,300 employees to report for work Thursday. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who has refused to return repeated phone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Winchester </ORGANIZATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WINC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that when he told workers to come back, he had no deal in hand. `` We took a risk that we were making progress and that things that had not been resolved would be resolved,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he cut the deal with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday night. `` We signed a contract with them and we signed a contract for some medical specialty fibers, and those enabled us to really put together a good business,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. He would not provide the dollar amount for the contracts. `` I think we're in a very secure position, probably the best position we've been in in a number of years,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> dismissed the suggestion that <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> had suddenly announced its closing, complete with overstated information on how the shuttle would be affected, with the intention of pressuring the government into funding a bailout. `` My honest opinion is they felt like they were just strapped and felt like they were going to shut down,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Such dependence of a single supplier is not uncommon in the aerospace industry, said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O'Neill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION>. `` It's so specialized _ there's not a commercial market out there for rockets,'' she said. `` There's not perfect competition, but there's not perfect competition in a lot of markets.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` We've got a lot of areas in the whole aerospace and military industries where there are a lot of potential problems if sources disappear from view,'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said. Avtex employees returned to work Thursday. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Almalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> met with management and said the company promised business as usual. Asked about the mood of the rank and file, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinklow </PERSON>, business agent of union local 371-T, said, `` Some of them are right happy and some are not.'' Some workers have already found other jobs and others said they wo n't return to the plant because of its history of worker-safety and environmental violations.

<HEAD>Norway May Halt Heavy Water Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The foreign minister said Thursday that <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> may stop exporting heavy water, used in producing nuclear weapons, following reports that a shipment intended for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was diverted to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told parliament that it was the Cabinet's intention to ban the exports, although `` the issue has not yet been handled and approved by the government. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> refuses to sell the water to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has tested nuclear devices, because <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Investigators said last week that the diverted shipment of Norwegian heavy water arrived in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1982 around the same time as a supply of Soviet heavy water, which made it difficult to trace. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the legal basis for banning future sales could be found in an export control bill passed last year, the national <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. He said he was discussing the issue with Trade Minister <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Balstad </PERSON>. Heavy water is used as a coolant in some nuclear reactors. It also can be used in the chemical process turning uranium into plutonium for nuclear explosives. The water is made by <ORGANIZATION> Norsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydro </ORGANIZATION> as a byproduct in its fertilizer production. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> has exported about 450 tons of heavy water to nearly 40 countries since the 1930s. Annual production has fallen to about two tons.

<HEAD>Boston Whalers Selling From Canada To Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To boaters, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> is instantly identifiable by its `` smirk,'' a horizontal crease in the bow of every one of the 165,000 boats that the company has sold since its founding in 1958. Today, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has more justification than ever for that smirk. The simple, sturdy, decidedly unsexy Whaler has succeeded this year in transferring its appeal from the recreational boating market to the commercial market, winning customers as diverse as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> ambulance corps and the kingdom of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Last week, the company announced it had won a $ 2.7 million contract to produce 32 military patrol boats for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Two of the 27-foot fiberglass launches are to be customized for King Fahd and a mosque. Each of the king's two launches will have twin 300-horsepower outboard motors, an outsized powerplant that can push a Whaler to more than 50 miles per hour. The 30 other boats, costing $ 80,000 a piece, will be equipped with sirens, radar, machine gun mounts and 225-horsepower motors. The Saudia Arabian contract, which required <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval, came on the heels of a $ 5 million contract to manufacture 122 small landing craft for the Marines. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whalers </ORGANIZATION> also are standard equipment for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. And the company has sold boats to government agencies in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` It's amazing,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. `` I do n't know how these people find out about us. But I know there are <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whalers </ORGANIZATION> being used as ambulances in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, patrol boats in <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> _ all over.'' For 30 years, the humble <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> has been a hot-selling pleasure boat for one main reason: it is virtually unsinkable. That trait is a result of the boat's composite construction, a sandwich of buoyant foam in fiberglass. It is a characteristic that appeals particularly to novice or safety-conscious boaters, and one the company has trumpeted in a series of sensational advertisements. In one ad, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> remains afloat even though it has been cut in half. In another, the boat does not sink, even when a crane lowers a <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> sedan onto it. That seaworthiness makes the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> a natural for military patrols and coastal surveillance. But until the early 1980s, the company sold virtually all of its boats to fishermen, water-skiers and other pleasure boat users. Only in the last five years has <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> made a substantial move into the commercial market, which now accounts for about 20 percent of its $ 66 million in annual sales, according to Foster. Headquartered in <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, about 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> has about 650 employees producing 5,500 boats a year. It is owned by <ORGANIZATION> CML </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a publicly traded firm that also owns retail stores and clothing catalogs, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>, and Britches of <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whalers </ORGANIZATION> range in size from 9 to 31 feet and in price from $ 2,300 to $ 127,000, all have the same basic foam and fiberglass construction, making them virtual life rafts. `` The ads are real eye-catchers,'' said <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. `` But they're also true.

<TEXT>
 The Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> took `` farmers'' out of its name Thursday in a change designed to show there are other agricultural careers besides working down on the farm. Delegates to the national convention voted to change the name to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the culmination of a five-year movement to broaden the organization's appeal. About 23,000 delegates are attending the convention. `` The students who are already in have no concerns about the name,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stagg </PERSON>, director of information for the 416,000-member organization. `` But the new students, those people have an awfully tough time getting beyond our name. They are not interested in farming and it was difficult for them to take on a jacket and associate themselves with the word farmer,'' he said. The change was made in hopes of counteracting a 23 percent loss of membership that has occurred since the mid-1970s. `` The problem we were experiencing was in the suburban and urban areas where those kids are not preparing to be farmers,'' said <PERSON> Stagg </PERSON>, adding that <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION>'s largest chapter was in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and its third largest was in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Interests of <ORGANIZATION> FFA </ORGANIZATION> members include horticulture, forestry, agriculture mechanics, agricultural journalism, research and marketing, <PERSON> Stagg </PERSON> said.

 The leader of the Afghan rebel alliance on Thursday criticized a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomat who mediated the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> accords, acusing him of bias against the Islamic insurgents and of trying to keep them out of power. <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, leader of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla coalition, also rejected any future role in government for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s premier, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON>, calling him `` a well-known -LRB- <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> -RRB- agent whose hands are dirty with the blood of our people.'' <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> told reporters that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assured him earlier Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the rebels, who call themselves the mujahedeen, or holy warriors, `` will continue as before.'' He met in the afternoon with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, the first time the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief has met with any leaders of the Afghan guerrilla alliance. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been supplying the rebels with Stinger missiles and other military and humanitarian aid in their campaign to drive the Soviet army out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to bolster a communist government. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> began withdrawing its more than 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> May 15 under the U.N.-mediated accords signed last April in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Half the troops were out by Aug. 15, and the accords call for the withdrawal to be completed by Feb. 15. A Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said last week that the rebel attacks could delay the pullout. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, of trying to cut the rebels out of any future Afghan government. `` We believe that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is not only <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>,'' the secretary-general's special representative for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, speaking <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> and accompanied by a translator. `` Unfortunately, Mr. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> could not be an impartial representative of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He took sides, and he took sides against the Afghan people and the mujahedeen, and this is why he failed in his mandate,'' <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said. He did not specify whose side he believed <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> supposedly had taken. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who became foreign minister of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> last summer, continues to serve as the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s special representative on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He has been trying to persuade <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s exiled King <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, to form a government of national reconciliation with other former Afghan politicians now in exile. Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government has refused to relinquish power and the rebels have sworn to continue fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> has said the rebels will hold democratic elections among Afghans in territory they now control, said to be more than two-thirds of the country, and among refugees and exiles to elect a national council. The council, he has said, would then adopt a constitution and hold national elections to form a broad-based government, excluding only senior officials of the current Communist government. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> are among those whom <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said could have no role in any future Afghan government.

<TEXT>
 The world's first dual-chamber pacemaker to use nuclear power was implanted in the chest of a 47-year-old man this week, and doctors said the atomic energy source will help the device last as long as 40 years. `` Theoretically, this pacemaker will last a lifetime,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsonnet </PERSON>, who operated on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sniffen </PERSON> of <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> on Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. Pacemakers, which regulate the heartbeat, have been around for years, but the device given to <PERSON> Sniffen </PERSON> is the first dual-chambered design powered by plutonium. While conventional battery-powered pacemakers must be replaced every five to eight years, <PERSON> Sniffen </PERSON>'s is expected to last from 20 to 40 years. Single-chamber nuclear pacemakers exist and last about 16 years, but the two-chamber design more naturally maintains the human heart's two-step rhythm. When the heart beats, the lower part squeezes blood into the upper chamber, where a second squeeze then sends the blood into the rest of the body. The Pulsar-N1 pacemaker, an oblong device about 2 -LCB- inches wide and an inch thick, is placed between the skin and the muscle of the chest wall. Two wires are threaded through a vein to the heart, where they are attached to the upper and lower chambers, alternately jolting them with electrical impulses and adapting to the patient's rate of activity, <PERSON> Parsonnet </PERSON> explained at a news conference Thursday. Single-chamber pacemakers only stimulate the lower chamber, said <PERSON> Parsonnet </PERSON>, who helped implant the first U.S.-made, single-chamber, nuclear-powered pacemaker in 1973. Doctors developed a dual-chamber pacemaker in 1974, but the power source was a lithium battery that has a lifetime of five to eight years. Nuclear pacemakers, powered by plutonium 238 encased in titanium, do not emit harmful levels of radiation, doctors said. `` Of the 3,000 to 4,000 put in worldwide there's never been any evidence of the isotope plutonium doing any harm to the patient or the environment,'' <PERSON> Parsonnet </PERSON> said. `` The average abdominal X-ray dose is about twice what you would get from the nuclear pacers,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Biocontrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, company that manufactures the device. <PERSON> Sniffen </PERSON>, who was listed in good condition, told reporters the single-chamber, nuclear-powered pacemaker he received in 1975 gave him `` jolts every once in a while and -LRB- I -RRB- was totally aware of it. `` Now I feel good. A little weak from the operation, but other than that, it's real nice,'' he said. A photocopying and facsimile machine salesman, <PERSON> Sniffen </PERSON> suffers from intermittent heart block, a condition that makes the heart stop occasionally and can cause the patient to faint. <PERSON> Parsonnet </PERSON> said that with its greater longevity, the new device can eliminate the need for replacement operations, reducing the physical and emotional stress on the patient and saving money. But the new pacemaker also has its drawbacks. Hospitals have to be licensed to implant the nuclear devices and patients have to be registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to use them. The dual-chamber nuclear device also costs more, about $ 6,000 compared to for $ 4,500 for its lithium counterpart. And it is also bigger and weighs more. `` The major issue is the paperwork and the size,'' <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>First Seal to Be Cured of Virus Released into Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An animal welfare group on Thursday returned to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> the first seal to be cured of a virus that has killed thousands of the mammals in northern European waters this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it released the 4-year-old female gray seal, nicknamed `` Godzilla,'' five miles off the eastern city of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. `` To everyone's great relief, <PERSON> Godzilla </PERSON> stretched out, lowered her head and then shuffled off into the sea,'' a spokesman said. `` It was a very moving sight because she was obviously glad to be going back where she belonged.'' The spokesman said <PERSON> Godzilla </PERSON> had been given seven weeks of intensive care after being brought ashore by divers Sept. 17. The group's chief inspector, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodenough </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Godzilla </PERSON> was named after the horror-film monster who fought King <PERSON> Kong </PERSON> because of the `` horrendous noise she made thundering around in the pen.'' At least 11,000 seals have died this year in northern European waters of an epidemic Western experts believe to be caused by a virus similar to the canine distemper virus. When <PERSON> Godzilla </PERSON> was first brought to veterinarians, she weighed 55 pounds and was coughing badly, said the spokesman, who requested anonymity. After treatment to combat lungworm and other infections, her weight more than doubled to 121 pounds and blood tests showed she had built up antibodies against the disease, he said. `` This is n't just a ` Bambi' story about rescuing a dear little animal and nursing it back to health,'' he said. `` We hope that Godzilla with her high level of antibodies will breed and strengthen the remaining common seal population.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said its latest figures showed between 80 and 90 percent of the 7,000-strong seal population off <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s coast had died in the epidemic.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, along with a former top aide, must repay $ 7.7 million to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> for reaping undeserved profits and mismanaging the TV ministry, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> ordered Thursday. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said he determined that the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> were overpaid during their last four years at the ministry. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, now under administration of the bankruptcy court, sued the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> last Feb. 1 for $ 52 million, alleging they grossly mismanaged the ministry by taking huge sums for personal use between 1984 and 1987, while <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> could n't pay its bills. During the suit's trial before Reynolds in September and October, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> dropped its claim to all but $ 7.7 million. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' judgment is the first time any court has ruled that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> or other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leaders used <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> donors' money improperly. In the order signed Wednesday and filed Thursday, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and left in March 1987 after admitting to a tryst with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, must pay <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> $ 4.9 million. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, his wife and former co-host of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> television show, must repay $ 677,397, and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> must repay $ 1 million. In addition, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> ordered, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> jointly must repay <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> another $ 1 million. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> was fired in April 1987 after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> handed over control of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, in his 50-page explanation for the judgments, said the expenditures at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> under the <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> administration were `` unbelievable'' and a `` waste of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s money.'' He also accused the administrators of `` gross mismanagement'' and `` total disregard for reality.'' The judge rejected <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attempts during the trial to justify the $ 6.6 million in salary and bonuses he and his wife collected between 1984 and 1987. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said in his order, `` In conforming with the religious overture of this case, this court observes that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> either overlooked or ignored parts of the Bible, including 1 <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> 6:10 ... ` For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.''' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said Galatians 6:7 should be applied to the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> case: `` ` Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.''' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> also said it appeared the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board of directors was never informed that the ministry and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> was in `` any kind of precarious financial position.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said, `` approached the management of the corporation with reckless indifference to the financial consequences of their acts.'' `` We plan to appeal,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said he could not comment on <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' order but said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could not repay the ministry because `` he does n't have anything.'' <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is `` obviously disappointed, as I think anybody would expect him to be.'' A secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' new organization, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ministries </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pineville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will not comment until he reads the order. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, did not immediately respond to a message left on the answering machine seeking comment. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> has been investigating <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials for more than a year. Last month, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and several former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> associates were notified they are targets of that investigation, which focuses on possible mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and criminal tax violations. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leggett </PERSON> said Thursday that although the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> have the right to appeal <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>'s judgment to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> intends to begin trying to collect. `` We will start procedures to locate their property, which can be sold to pay the judgment,'' <PERSON> Leggett </PERSON> said. It was unclear how much money and property remains in the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' names, as they are living in a home supporters rent for them.

<HEAD>Osteoporosis Strikes Men, Though Not As Often As Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Osteoporosis, though most common among women, also affects men and may be associated with alcoholism, a hormone deficiency, or both, says a new report. The disease, in men and women, can lead to injuries such as hip fractures that cause `` big public health costs, mortality and disability,'' said Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, an endocrinologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` Traditionally, osteoporosis is considered a disease of women, but it affects men too,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. `` It is a problem that involves older men, and as men live longer, it will become a bigger health problem.'' His findings were published in Friday's issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Favus </PERSON>, an endocrinologist and director of the bone program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, said research suggests that by age 70, one-quarter of the women in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will have sustained a fracture related to osteoporosis. Probably fewer than 10 percent of the known cases of osteoporosis are among men, though `` I'm sure there is a lot more of it out there than we see,'' he said Thursday, adding there has not been much research on osteoporosis in men. Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and may be accompanied by increasing porosity and brittleness. Most common in women, it can lead to spinal crush fractures that cause dowager's hump and pain, said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> `` Men have more bone mass than women at maturity, and they do not have the accelerated loss associated with menopause,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` So they have two advantages _ more bone to start with and not losing as much.'' <PERSON> Favus </PERSON> said a lack of estrogen following menopause is the main factor in osteoporosis in women, but with men, often `` we do n't know the cause.'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said spinal crush fractures are six to seven times more common in women, but hip fractures are only about twice as common in women. `` The hip fracture is the one that produces the big public health costs, mortality and disability,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. He said there seem to be more secondary causes of osteoporosis in men, particularly alcoholism and a lack of the hormone testosterone. Smoking also can increase the risk of osteoporosis, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. If secondary causes are treated or ruled out, doctors should make sure patients have an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, along with exercise, said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. `` Osteoporosis is silent ... there is no clue until they fracture something,'' said <PERSON> Favus </PERSON>. `` There needs to be more awareness -LRB- about osteoporosis -RRB- among physicians and among men.''

 <PERSON> Maestro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> returned to his musical roots Thursday night to direct the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, which he first joined in his teens as a full-time violinist and apprentice conductor. <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> made his debut as music director of the 100-member orchestra, filling a vacancy created by the departure of <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> more than four years ago. It was a happy and much-heralded homecoming for <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>, 58, who has worked with orchestras in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I enjoy being here. I am an American and I feel my place is in this country even though I've conducted so much abroad,'' he said during a rehearsal break Wednesday. <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>'s presence on the podium Thursday night was his first public appearance as the symphony's music director. He had been serving since 1984 as music consultant and adviser for the symphony, considered to be among the nation's best orchestras. Orchestra officials are counting on <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> to be the symphony's ticket to greater international recognition and renewed financial success The symphony has a projected 1987-88 loss of $ 1.5 million, its largest ever. Officials say the orchestra's financial problems stem from fewer anticipated grants, rising operating costs and the opening of the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts. The new hall lured away the local opera and ballet companies, resulting in lost rentals. Managing Director <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON> said a $ 3 million grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Vira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> helps make <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> one of the highest paid conductors in the nation. He declined to provide specifics. `` I can guarantee to you if we would have paid less to somebody, the quality would have gone by ... much faster than the money would,'' <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> said his first priority is to make the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> more visible worldwide. `` It's a question of presentation and projection,'' he said. `` Now, because of my appointment, people are thinking about <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and discovering the values that they've had all along.'' He said classical music is on an upswing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We're rediscovering values like the family, homegrown apples and with it, I think, will come a heightened awareness of classical music,'' he said. <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>'s formal, high-brow style contrasts sharply with that of <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, who shocked local audiences when he suddently shed his tuxedo for a black vest and open white shirt near the end of his reign in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> parents, moved to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> as a youth to study violin under <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakaleinikoff </PERSON>. He attended <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, where he studied literature and philosophy. <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, recently retired as head of a local youth orchestra. In 1984, <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> had resigned amid controversy as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>, a post he held for nearly two years following 10 years with the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> accepted the job of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s music director in late 1986. His contract runs through the 1991-92 season. <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>'s arrival in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> this week had an immediate impact. `` He walked on stage -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- and within a few second, it was like a miracle. It became a first-rate ensemble,'' <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON> said. `` I've been around conductors all my life and I do n't remember seeing that kind of thing happen.''

 With a funeral director reading the vote tallies, thousands gathered Thursday for a 196-year-old tradition of bringing <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s winners and losers of the general election together to literally bury the hatchet. An estimated 27,000 people _ including dozens of politicians _ showed up for Return Day. `` This is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The majority has spoken. It's a great day and woe be to those persons who are n't here,'' former <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Conaway </PERSON> said of the politicians who lost their elections and were n't in attendance. Return Day has been held here since <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, a community of about 2,000 people, was made the <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seat in 1792. The celebration always takes place the Thursday after the general election, with the focus on a parade where winners and losers ride together in horse-drawn carriages or other modes of transportation to put campaign differences aside. Funeral director <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> read the county's election returns from the balcony of the county courthouse, dressed in a black silk top hat and tails and white gloves. Once the returns are read, tradition calls for party leaders to do the hatchet burying. <PERSON> Conaway </PERSON> laid a hatchet in a box, and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Battaglia </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> stepped forward and together emptied a bucket full of sand over it. The crowd cheered. `` It's not easy. You have to be on both sides to really appreciate it,'' said <PERSON> Conaway </PERSON>, who has served as Return Day master of ceremonies since 1976. <PERSON> Conaway </PERSON> has been both a winner and loser. A Democrat, he enjoyed a long tenure as <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator until Republicans took control of the county commissioners in 1986. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, re-elected state insurance commissioner, has also participated as a loser. Six years ago, he lost a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate race. `` When I came as a loser it was no fun. It was a strain,'' he said Thursday. `` This time I have a 30-point win and it makes it a lot easier.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> set off a confrontation Thursday with the Iran-Contra prosecutor by telling a judge that a prosecution brief filed in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s case `` mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles.'' In an unusual move, the department sought court permission to file a brief in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s case to `` articulate, clearly and definitively the executive's view'' of the relationship between the president and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The department said a brief filed last month by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` contains numerous statements that are inconsistent with previously articulated statements of the law by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and other Executive Branch agencies and departments.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s brief in support of charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants conspired to defraud the government by diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contras `` mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles of separation of powers and executive branch authority,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The filing was made by Assistant Attorneys General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the criminal division, and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kmiec </PERSON>, of the office of legal counsel. Department officials refused to specify the legal disagreements with <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. But the filing referred to a pleading in which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> discussed the workings of the Boland Amendment, a series of restrictions on military aid to the Contras that were enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s brief disputed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s position that the <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> did n't apply to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, where the former presidential aide had worked before he was fired two years ago. A 1985 memo by <PERSON> Bretton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciaroni </PERSON>, the counsel to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oversight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the Boland Amendment did not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it needs until Nov. 25 to file its legal views, saying <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` effectively precluded the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> from advising the IC -LRB- independent counsel -RRB-, prior to the filing of its memorandum, of the department's views with respect to separation of powers and executive authority.'' The filing drew a tart response from <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office, which issued a statement saying: `` The independent counsel rejects the suggestion that it should have solicited the views of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> or that it has mischaracterized the law. `` While the independent counsel does not object to the submission of legal views by the department, it strenuously opposes this wholly unjustified 11th-hour motion for an extension of time,'' the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it `` does not seek to support either the motions filed by the defendant'' or <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s `` efforts to defeat those motions.'' `` Accordingly, the department does not intend to argue for or against dismissal of Count One of the indictment.'' The department said it decided Wednesday to make the filing after consulting the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> departments and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The filing came hours after <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had rebuked <PERSON> North </PERSON> in an opinion, saying his argument to dismiss charges he lied `` reveals a skewed attitude toward our form of constitutional government.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had denied defense motions to dismiss charges that the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide obstructed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s November 1986 inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair by destroying documents and lying to then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. North `` fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> wrote in a scathing opinion that denounced the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel's contention that no laws were broken when he lied to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and destroyed documents. The judge rejected defense arguments that North can not be prosecuted for lying to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> because the attorney general's questioning was not part of a `` pending proceeding'' before a government agency North is charged with lying when, among other things, he denied to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> any <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> involvement in diverting arms-sale proceeds to the Contras. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s contention `` that he had an absolute right to lie, to obstruct such inquiries, and to remove or destroy official <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> records because he had not been warned that if he did so he might be indicted.'' `` There is nothing in the Constitution, federal statutes, or applicable decisions which warrants this cynical approach,'' he said. The judge also rejected <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s suggestion that he can not be prosecuted `` because he was not put on notice that criminal statutes long in effect would be applied to him if he acted corruptly as alleged.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` will need only to prove at trial that the specific questions posed to North by the attorney general were precise and material to this legitimate presidential inquiry'' and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> purposely lied, the judge said. North is charged with conspiring with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. No date has been set for any of the four trials ordered by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> for each defendant.

The consolidation will add 400 to 450 jobs at the Kennedy Space Center, with about 100 to 125 of those transferring from other <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> divisions. The greatest number will come from the company's facility at <LOCATION> Downey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> There are about 200 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> launch support workers here. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the contract will consolidate <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s space shuttle logistics operation in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with its launch support operations here. Some engineering design support and manufacturing tasks will continue at <LOCATION> Downey </LOCATION>, where a space shuttle is being built to replace Challenger, destroyed in a 1986 explosion. The contract, signed with <PERSON> Rocwell </PERSON>'s Space Transportations Systems Division, covers a three-year period starting last Oct. 1. It does not represent any new work but is an extension and consolidation of existing functions managed by the Kennedy Space Center, officials said. The work involves repair of shuttle orbiter and ground support equipment hardware and purchase of support equipment spares.

<TEXT>
 The president of parliament called the early years of the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> era a `` glorious'' time for many Germans, triggering a walkout during the government's ceremony Thursday marking the Kristallnacht. The remarks by <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenniger </PERSON> threatened to overshadow <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s carefully planned ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Kristallnacht, the night the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> began their first organized assault against the Jews. But a leader of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON>, defended <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech, saying it was simply describing the situation in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during those years. <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> said he did not understand the calls for Jenninger to resign. `` I welcome that the parliament president described in full clarity what was happening in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> between 1933 and 1938,'' <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON>, a deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of Jews in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said in a television interview. `` Especially the fact that everything that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> did was strongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' he added. <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s remarks prompted demands for his resignation by members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who were among about 50 who marched out of the hall during the nationally televised speech to parliament. The national ARD and <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> networks </ORGANIZATION> both reported late Thursday that <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> was expected to resign shortly. The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION>, which is close to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative government, said <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> was expected to announce his resignation Friday. In its early Friday edition, <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> strongly criticized <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> at a private meeting Thursday, but left it to <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> whether to resign. Social Democrat chairman <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>, a conservative, that the parliament president had shown a `` disturbing lack of judgment'' in his speech. In his speech, the 56-year-old <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> had talked at length about the positive feelings of many ordinary Germans early in the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> dictatorship. `` Did n't <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> bring to reality what -LRB- <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> had only promised, that is to lead the Germans to glorious times? Was n't he chosen by <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, a Fuehrer such as is given to a people only once in a thousand years? <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> asked. `` For the fate of the Germans and European Jews, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and misdeeds,'' <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> said `` The years from 1933 to 1938, even from a distant retrospective and in the knowledge of what followed, still are a fascinating thing today, since throughout history there was hardly a parallel to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s triumphal procession during the first years.'' <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> then cited such events as inclusion of the <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and part of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> into the Third Reich, as well as the 1936 Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. But some listeners also had sobbed when <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> read an eyewitness account of the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942. `` Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' he read. `` Some of those shot were still moving, some lifted their arms and turned their heads, to show they were still alive.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it was astonished by <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech. `` We have known Dr. <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> for years as the man who headed many friendly delegations to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' it said in a statement. `` The way of interpreting the Nazi era and the description of its historical background in his speech are unacceptable for any Jew,'' it said. `` It was a miserable speech, whatever the original intentions may be.'' <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, president of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s remarks were `` reprehensible'' and demanded an urgent explanation. Later Thursday, a Greens lawmaker said <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>'s speech showed that `` anti-Semitism exists in the hearts of many members of this house.'' The statement by <PERSON> Jutta </PERSON> <PERSON> Oesterle-Schwerin </PERSON> brought loud jeers from other lawmakers and parliament vice-president <PERSON> Annemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Renger </PERSON> several times tried to interrupt Mrs. <PERSON> Oesterle-Schwerin </PERSON>'s speech, finally shutting off the microphone. Starting with the Kristallnacht of Nov. 9-10, 1938, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> made clear their intentions to wipe out European Jews. On that night, Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues, sending 30,000 Jews to concentration camps and killing 91 Jews. Shattered glass covered the streets and the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, in a boastful mood, named it Kristallnacht, which in English is Crystal Night. The Nazis killed 6 million Jews and many others during <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rule from 1933 to 1945 Before <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> spoke at the government's ceremonies, an 88-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON> read from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Celan </PERSON>'s poem `` Todesfuge,'' one of the most dramatic poems about the Holocaust. `` Death is a master from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, his eye is blue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>, an actress and director in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, read. `` He strikes thee with leaden bullets, he strikes thee exactly.'' In <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, thousands of people gathered at one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest synagogues for ceremonies marking the start of its restoration, timed to coincide with the Kristallnacht rememberances.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Thursday with the leaders of his presidential transition team and with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the Cabinet before traveling to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for a four-day vacation. As his presidential campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was being dismantled, the president-elect huddled with his chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, and campaign adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, the two people he named to head the transition effort following his election victory. He also attended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s morning meeting with White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> and the president's daily briefing with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. The president-elect and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, arrived late Thursday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where they were met by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. The couple later traveled to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> home of close friend <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamps </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a 49-year-old multimillionaire who like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his money in the oil business. Upon arriving, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to engage in a conversation with reporters, but when one journalist shouted, `` How's the transition going?'' the president-elect smiled and said, `` Could n't be going better.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chatted briefly with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two, where she related a story about the tightened security for the president-elect and his family. She said that she wanted to talk a walk in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> park the other day and the park was closed to the public, allowing her to walk alone. `` I'll never walk in a public park again,'' she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not take advisers or staff members with him on what his aides insisted was primarily a vacation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to fish and relax in <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He told reporters he also intended to spend time on the telephone as he contemplates his new administration. At the afternoon Cabinet meeting, the president and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked in together and were applauded by the assembled members, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We do n't even argue over which side of the table to sit on,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quipped as he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took their usual positions opposite one another across the table. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> had asked all presidential appointees to submit their resignations to smooth the way for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to name his own choices when he takes office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already named his secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, longtime friend and adviser <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The president indicated he wanted the transition as smooth and cooperative as possible, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. And he urged the cabinet to be cooperative and be prepared to stay past Jan. 20 if needed while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> completes the transition. `` He told us yesterday he is not going to try to step into <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shoes until after Jan. 20,'' which is inauguration day, press secretary <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also met in his Executive Office Building office with a group of rebels from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` This was an opportunity for him to do what he has traditionally done, which is meet with foreign leaders and foreign representatives,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burhannudin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, that he would support their efforts toward total withdrawal of Soviet troops and and self-determination, but did not pledge any specific monetary or other support, according to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>.

 Fire touched off a chemical explosion at a printing plant Thursday, sending 17 people to hospitals with burns, cuts and bruises and forcing an evacuation at the state's largest newspaper. The injured included 15 firefighters who were blown through the air by an explosion as they used water and chemicals to fight the second of two fires at the plant, said city fire Capt. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliner </PERSON>. He said none of the firefighters' injuries were believed to be serious. Two pressmen at the Standard Gravure plant were taken to hospitals for treatment of second-degree burns on their arms and faces, officials said. Production of The Courier-Journal was disrupted by the evacuation of that newspaper's building, which is adjacent to the printing plant and also houses the main office for <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Workers were allowed back into the building at 10 p.m., but power was not fully restored immediately. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, president and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said his staff was `` going to go back to the old-fashioned way'' to put out Friday's editions. <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> staffers set up with typewriters and telephones in an old company-owned building across the street. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said editors planned to dictate their copy to the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Herald-Leader, 80 miles away, and Friday's editions would be printed there. The two newspapers are statewide competitors, but have an agreement to help each other through such emergencies. Naphtha, a volatile chemical used to thin ink in printing, was believed responsible for the explosion, said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithers </PERSON>, night supervisor at the plant, which prints magazines and color advertising materials. <PERSON> Smithers </PERSON> said the first fire broke out about 6 p.m. in one of the presses, injuring the two pressmen. A co-worker, press operator <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Emert </PERSON>, identified them as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitzler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. Workers around them `` did what they were supposed to do. We ran like hell,'' said <PERSON> Emert </PERSON>, 52. A chemical fire exinguisher came on automatically, he said. Workers were cleaning up from the first fire when the second flared, apparently ignited by embers contacting newsprint and ink on the floor, <PERSON> Smithers </PERSON> said. Firefighters had entered with chemicals and hoses to put out the ink-related fire when naphtha on the floor and in the air ignited without warning, <PERSON> Smithers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Milliner </PERSON> said the force of the blast lifted firefighters off their feet, knocking some into walls and through doors. The explosion, which occurred about 1 -LCB- hours after the first fire, also left a gaping, two-story hole in the rear wall of the six-story Standard Gravure building. Injured firefighters staggered from the building, coughing and gasping, and some appeared dazed. They were given oxygen masks, put on stretchers and taken away in ambulances.

<TEXT>
 A judge on Thursday ordered federal prison officials to allow inmates to write bylined newspaper articles for pay, and to stop retaliating against a prisoner who wrote an article criticizing a warden. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> said he was persuaded that the inmate whose transfer started the case, <PERSON> Dannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, posed `` no threat to safety or order within the institution'' by his writing, and was being punished only for the content of his articles in the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> from enforcing seldom-used rules that forbid federal prisoners from receiving pay or using bylines when writing for newspapers and other outside publications. He said officials had allowed many prisoners to write articles or books for pay and had failed to show that enforcement of the ban, against <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> or anyone else, would promote safety or any other valid concern in running the prisons. He also said a rule that prohibits inmates from running businesses in prison can not be enforced against writers. The injunction is binding until <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s suit goes to trial. Since the case arose, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has been transferred from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> federal prison to a prison near <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The Chronicle asked <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> to return <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where his observations would have more value for the newspaper's readers; the judge said he was uncertain about security and space considerations, and asked the lawyers to consult one another. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said she was surprised by the ruling, and particularly by <PERSON> Legge </PERSON>'s refusal to rule out damage awards against prison officials involved in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s case. She said no decision has been made on an appeal. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 48, began serving a 33-year sentence for bank robbery in 1981. He started sending articles to the Chronicle about two years ago on his observations about prison life and conditions at the federal prison in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he then was confined. This June, he was placed in solitary confinement three days after the Chronicle ran his article criticizing <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>'s new warden, <PERSON> R.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> then was transferred twice in the next two weeks. His suit, joined by the <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, contended that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was being treated unfairly and that the regulations prohibiting bylined and paid articles by prisoners violated constitutional freedom of expression. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, the government's lawyer, declared, `` This is not a censorship case,'' and argued that the ban on bylined and paid outside articles was justified by security considerations. `` The money that Mr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was trying to earn caused him to look for and say things he might not otherwise have said,'' such as interviewing other prisoners, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't control an inmate who has his own money.'' But <PERSON> Legge </PERSON> said other prisoners had been allowed to earn money, and that there was substantial evidence that the actions against <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> were based on the content of his writings.

<HEAD>Parkinson's Patient Receives Fetal Cell Implant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors announced Thursday they have implanted fetal tissue into the brain of a patient with Parkinson's disease in experimental surgery aimed at curtailing the disease's symptoms. The doctors who performed the surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said they believed the operation was the first of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, who headed the surgery team, said the operation has been performed on a few Parkinson's patients in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, but he added the results have been far from satisfactory. Freed said the eight-hour surgery Wednesday was on a 52-year-old <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> man who has had Parkinson's for 20 years. Parkinson's disease results from the loss of brain cells that produce a substance called dopamine. Symptoms include tremors, slow movement, rigidity in the limbs and stooped posture. Freed, a professor of medicine and pharmacology, said his experiments on monkeys indicate that fetal tissue implanted in the adult brain can begin producing dopamine and possibly curtail Parkinson's symptoms. He said the fetal cells `` are exactly like seeds,'' which could take up to six months to grow, spread and `` re-energize the brain.'' The controversial fetal-cell implants have been used in recent years in an effort to help diabetics and, most notably, radiation victims of the nuclear power plant accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Freed said. Some abortion opponents have claimed fetal-cell implants could encourage more women to have abortions. Freed said many researchers in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` are primed'' to use fetal-cell implants on Parkinson's patients, but he believes his experiment was the first. <ORGANIZATION> CU </ORGANIZATION> neurosurgeon <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeze </PERSON>, who actually transplanted the cells Wednesday, said they were implanted with needles through a hole in the top of the skull to the area deep in the brain where dopamine acts. The patient, who has asked not to be identified, was conscious throughout the operation and was recovering well Thursday, <PERSON> Breeze </PERSON> said. `` We're happy to see that the patient tolerated the procedure so well, and now it's a waiting period,'' said Freed at a news conference. The two milligrams of tissue used Wednesday were obtained after an abortion performed by a physician who was n't involved in the research, the doctors said. The CU researchers stressed that the woman gave her consent to the use of the tissue, and she was n't paid for it. Freed said his scientific research should n't be confused with the political issue of abortion. `` We'd like to separate the case of fetal tissue from the act of abortion, which is clearly a political issue,'' he said. `` Given the abortion's happened ... can we throw this stuff away? `` Fetal cells have much more flexibility _ they will grow under conditions where adult cells wo n't grow,'' he said. The tissue must come from a fetus aged 6 weeks to 9 weeks. The surgery was approved by the center's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subjects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and was funded through private donations. Freed said he estimated the operation would end up costing about $ 10,000. The standard treatment for Parkinson's disease has been a drug called L-dopa, which has proven effective in the early stages of the disease but becomes less effective as Parkinsonism becomes more severe. Freed said the patient has been unable to work for several years, despite heavy doses of drugs every 2 -LCB- hours. Freed was cautious about predicting how much the man's condition could improve as a result of the surgery. `` We expect general mobility would improve and hopefully a reduction in drug needs,'' he said. Freed said the CU team intends to perform more fetal-cell implants on Parkinson's patients in the future.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Thursday voted to set a quota of 24 black representatives on their 574-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION>, which now has only eight blacks. With little more than half its members present, the synod debated for 2 -LCB- hours, then voted 214-74 with 11 abstentions for the quota. The Archbishop of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Most Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON>, said the change would encourage blacks to run for election to the synod in their church parishes. `` We need to increase their representation in the church as a whole because black people in our midst have a great contribution to make,'' <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON> said. The vote followed a report from the church's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerns </ORGANIZATION> proposing the change for the next synod elections in 1990. The church's first black bishop to serve in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, Barbados-born Bishop of <PERSON> Croydon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who chairs the committee, said after the vote: `` I'm gratified by it ... I hope black people will come forward and take their places in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' Synod candidates for election in 1990 will have to complete an ethnic monitoring questionnaire. If the number of blacks elected falls below 24, the quota will be made up from unsuccessful black candidates with the highest votes. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON>, the Conservative government's local government minister and a leading member of the synod, opposed the motion which he called `` apartheid in reverse.'' <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON> said the problem was that not enough blacks ran for the synod and the church should do more by asking blacks to be candidates. There are no statistics on how many blacks there are in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, which has about 1 million regular Sunday worshipers and has been in slow decline for most of this century. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s committee estimates <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s black community may be almost 7 percent of the 49 million population.

<HEAD>LBJ Son-In-Law Makes Democrats Electable in Virginia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For three years, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> was out of the spotlight that had become so familiar, first as the son-in-law of President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and then as Democratic governor of this conservative state. But on Tuesday, the 49-year-old lawyer re-entered the national arena in decisive style, fashioning a huge victory over <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> long-shot <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a retired black minister and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said today he won because `` we attempted to identify with mainstream values that are crucial to success at the national level,'' such as strong defense and fiscal responsibility. With 99 percent of the precincts counted, <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> had 1,448,389 votes or 71 percent, to <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>' 587,887 votes or 29 percent. The former Marine combat officer has built a career by making Democrats electable in conservative <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Once known only as the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> military social aide who married <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s daughter, <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, he won the lieutenant governor's race in 1977 in his first bid for elective office. Four years later, he ran for governor in the first sweep by Democrats of the state's top three offices since 1965. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> was a popular governor who was credited with overhauling the state bureaucracy and making major gains in education funding. He also opened positions of authority in state government to blacks and women and appointed <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s first black <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> member. The former governor was also one of the architects of last spring's Super Tuesday presidential primary, intended in part to give the Southern vote collective strength. But <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>'s tenure was shaken by prison troubles that drew national attention when six death row inmates escaped in May 1984. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, who could not succeed himself under <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s constitution, had been out of office for three years and practicing law until his bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` I've been unemployed for a long time, and it looks like I just got a job,'' he said.

<HEAD>Text Of Welcome Ceremony At White House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of remarks given as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, welcomed President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, to the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. Reagan: Thank you. <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and Bar and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, it's wonderful to have you here And if anyone wants to know how <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I feel about this moment, just read our smiles. Actually though, I have some figures here that I thought you and the rest of the country might be interested in. According to my calculations, it's only 1188 days to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus. Now, I think the country has heard quite enough political speech-making from all of us in the past few months, so I just want to make one or two simple but heart-felt points. First, I want you to know, Mr. <PERSON> President-elect </PERSON> and Mr. Vice President-elect, how proud I am of both of you, of the extraordinary perseverence and character and grit that you've shown in this difficult year. And I think, too, your worthy opponents would agree what a challenge to human endurance a presidential campaign has become. So I want to congratulate both of you, as well as Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in taking on the great challenge, and your sense of public duty in seeing it through to the end. Each of you is better for it and so is the country. Now, in this hard-fought campaign, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, I also want to compliment you for going to the people on the issues and asking for a mandate on critical matters like the taxing and spending power, the nature of judicial appointments, the strength of our defenses, and the firmness of our foreign policy. I think that mandate has been unmistakably delivered, and I know in carrying it out, you will be true to your promises and faithful to the people's wishes. With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, I feel our achievements are secure, our change now a permanent feature of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government. But I also believe your mandate will make it possible not just to continue, but to build upon the achievements of the past eight years. This is not the end of an era, but a time to refresh and strengthen our new beginning. In fact, to those who sometimes flatter me with talk of a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution, today my hope is this: `` You ai n't seen nothing yet.'' And finally, let me say that, despite the long months of campaigning, the seemingly endless controversy and the sheer human exhaustion of it all, choosing our leaders is, after all, a decision critical to our own future, to the future of this much-loved nation, and to the cause of human freedom. And that's why today, Americans of every political persuasion and background can come together as one. Even as we accept the verdict of the majority and pledge to protect always the rights of the minority, we put behind us the divisions and controversies of the immediate past and begin anew. So it's a day for congratulations, yes. But it's also a day for remembering that whatever may temporarily divide us is far outweighed by that which unites us. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has much to be proud of today. Pledges of a new president and a new vice president, and pledges of support from the loyal opposition, Republican, Democrat, Independent. Today, we're one nation, one people, and our national treasure, our national mission, the cause of human freedom continues to prosper and light the world. Thank you. God bless you. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Thank you, Mr. President. And all I will say, just in the shadow of the office that you have enobled, we are very, very grateful to you. I do n't believe there is a case in modern presidential politics where a president has worked so hard to help someone else achieve this office. And I will always be grateful. I can hardly believe it. But it's sinking in now, the enormity of what has taken place, a peaceful election, eventually a peaceful transfer of power. And I just think for all the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family, and I expect I speak for <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> on this one, and we are grateful to you and to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> for going that extra mile. And I can _ I really believe that the results would have been entirely different if we had n't had this loyal, steadfast campaign support _ and I know they would _ if I had n't learned from a giant the good things about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thank you, sir. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>. Quayle: Well, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, as one who came to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, thank you for all that you have done for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And now, Mr. <PERSON> President-elect </PERSON>, yesterday, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people overwhelmingly placed their trust and their confidence in your leadership. And I am delighted to be a part of that team; ready to go to work and to continue to change <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and make it even greater. Thank you both very, very much.

<TEXT>
 A reputed mob figure in the Philadelphia-southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> area was convicted Wednesday of running a `` criminal enterprise,'' loan sharking, dealing in cocaine and importing a chemical used to make the drug `` speed.'' A federal jury found <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> `` Reds'' Pontani of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> guilty of 10 counts in a 12-count indictment. Four associates also were convicted on various loan-harking, drug and illegal phone use counts. Authorities said the case struck a blow to the organization of alleged crime boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, who is on trial on racketeering charges in federal court in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pontani </PERSON>, 61, faces up to life in prison. The jury, which deliberated nearly three days, also convicted <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> `` Cappy'' <PERSON> Belardo </PERSON>, 59, of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Muccie </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>; and former <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, in his mid-40s, of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>. All face lengthy prison terms at their Jan. 3 sentencing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maryanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. The government relied on secretly taped conversations involving the defendants, and the testimony of admitted or jailed drug-dealers who served as paid government informants. <PERSON> Pontani </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Manno </PERSON>, said he would appeal the conviction. `` It's a sorry day when the government can decide in advance who's good and bad and set out to find a crime, by paying people, by giving immunity'' and other considerations `` none of which the defense could even think of doing with a witness,'' he said. `` It's an even sorrier day when the jury believes those kind of people.'' He would not comment on the government's allegations about <PERSON> Pontani </PERSON>'s organized crime ties, which were not included in the indictment.

 Maoist guerrillas killed two soldiers, a police chief and a farmer in two attacks Wednesday, police said. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s eastern jungle, dozens of guerrillas from the Maoist Shining Path ambushed an army patrol, killing the two soldiers and wounding two others, police said. The soldiers were patrolling on foot near <LOCATION> Huayranga </LOCATION>, a settlement in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle 270 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, which is 130 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Four soldiers were listed as missing after a brief clash that followed the ambush, police said. It was not immediately known how many soldiers were in the patrol and whether the guerrillas suffered any casualties. The Shining Path has been fighting since 1980 to impose Marxist rule in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The insurgency erupted in the south central Andes but has since spread to coastal urban centers and into the sparsely populated eastern jungle. More than 12,000 people, mainly highland peasants, have died in the violence, according to the government. Also Wednesday in the Andean highlands, a column of <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas dragged a village police chief and a farmer from their homes before dawn and shot and killed them in the town square, police said. The men were slain for being members of the ruling center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the police said. The incident occured in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quilulla </LOCATION>, a hamlet on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>.

 Students who enter livestock at a show next year may have their animals tested for drugs such as steroids, organizers said. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON>, assistant general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION>, said organizers wanted to assure `` the group of Houstonians who support our youngsters and buy meat at our shows'' that the meat is free of any drug residue. He said the show, which attracts members of 4-H and <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, also wants to `` teach youngsters the responsibility of how to raise meat for the market under federal laws.'' The program will affect those students who show steers, pigs, poultry and lambs that are slaughtered afterward for food. It will not apply to professional ranchers and breeders who show animals used strictly for breeding, <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON> said. `` No doubt this will be the pioneer,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Large </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practitioners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` In my opinion, if it goes off well and people stand behind it, a lot of major shows will follow.'' Blood or urine samples could be taken at any time during the show, <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON> said. Animals testing positive for drugs would be disqualified. Prizes and money from animal sales will be held until drug tests are completed. `` It is safe to assume that any animal who wins will be tested,'' he said, adding that other animals will be tested at random. Surveys at previous livestock shows in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> indicated that some animals had been given anabolic steroids, tranquilizers and diuretics. Steroids help add bulk to animals.

 <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> conceded Wednesday that his 18-year career in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was over, and he called Democratic <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>'s victory by less than 1 percent of the vote `` a clear mandate by the people.'' Secretary of the State <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said Wednesday night that the official vote totals showed <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> won by 10,052 votes, a larger margin than the 8,208-vote spread the unofficial tallies showed. She said it was <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s tightest statewide election since an attorney general's contest in 1970, but that it was not close enough to order a recount. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> had 688,494 votes, 49.76 percent, to the liberal Republican's 678,442 votes, or 49.04 percent. Two third-party candidates shared 1 percent of the total. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, in a news conference in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, shouldered the responsibility for his defeat and ruled out any future in politics or in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` I'm a big guy.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, vowing to revitalize government with `` a brand new team of people,'' has instructed key figures from his campaign to develop priorities for the crucial first 100 days of his coming administration. Even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the presidency, job applications were pouring into his standby transition office. The stream of resumes is expected to turn into a flood now at newly opened <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition headquarters. Just hours after claiming victory, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the first steps Wednesday toward assembling his presidency. The president-elect, at a news conference in his adopted home of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> before flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, named <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his campaign chairman and longtime trusted adviser, to be secretary of state. It could be the most important post in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency, given the vice president's emphasis on foreign affairs and his interest in pursuing progress with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was back tending to <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> duties a day after losing his bid for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, promising to be <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' `` very best governor'' and warning that the negative tone of this year's campaign set a dangerous precedent for coming races. `` I gave it my best shot,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday after spending several hours catching up on state business. `` Almost does n't count in politics.'' He said he felt no bitterness toward <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and was ready to put the campaign behind him and complete the final two years of his term as governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave no indication whether he will run for a fourth term in 1990 or seek the presidency again in four years. `` At this point my job is clear: I'm going to be the very best governor of this commonwealth that I can be,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters. `` There's a lot to do. There are many challenges out there ahead. What happens in the future remains to be seen.''

 With candles, prayers and a pealing of church bells, Americans marked the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the `` night of broken glass'' that shattered lives and illusions as it ushered in the Nazi Holocaust. Synagogues, churches and schools in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and other cities on Wednesday commemorated the Nazi riots of Nov. 9, 1938, when scores of Jews were killed and more than 1,100 synagogues set afire. The anniversary also was marked in cities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We all had before the Holocaust the hope of betterment of man,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> told about 100 people at <ORGANIZATION> Ezra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` This day is one of reflection on a day of broken glass and shattered dreams.''

 As Germans commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nazi pogrom called Kristallnacht, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest Jewish cemeteries is in ruins and one of its most magnificent synagogues remains a bombed-out hulk. Both sites are in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and have been focal points of observances of the Nov. 9-10, 1938, attacks by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> thugs on Jews, their businesses and synagogues that launched the Holocaust. In the 108-year-old Jewish cemetery, the graves of once-prominent <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> intellectuals, artists, scientists and businessmen are overgrown by trees and shrubs. Visitors must weave through dense underbrush to view gravestones toppling after decades of neglect. The once-ornate synagogue, built in 1866, escaped destruction during Kristallnacht, which means ` Night of Broken Glass' in German. Witnesses say a police officer prevented Nazi brownshirts from starting enough fires to destroy the building, then called a fire brigade that put out the blaze.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The male image gets something of a lift in a PBS series starting Sunday night, `` The Nature of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' showing the animal world Down Under as more than just koalas, kangaroos and crocodiles. The six one-hour shows on the PBS series `` Nature'' are its way of celebrating <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s bicentennial. Take for example the leafy sea dragon, one of several creatures that practice a form of male pregnancy to protect their offspring. This cousin of the seahorse lives off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and is named for its camouflage of leaf-like outgrowths that make it look like a piece of kelp. It hatches its young _ up to 200 of them _ in individual capsules that form soon after the female lays the eggs on the male's tail. Then there's the marsupial frog, a rain-forest dweller whose hatchlings wriggle onto their father's flanks and push their way into pockets that have formed there to complete their development. Brooding also is a male task in the Great Barrier Reef among the Australian pike fish, a long, thin speckled species that, after an elaborate courtship ritual, takes the eggs from the female into its pouch until the young emerge. And another resident of the reef off the northeastern coast of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is the yellow-striped cardinal fish which incubates hundreds of eggs clustered in a sticky ball _ in its mouth. Male pregnancy `` fascinates us because we're used to thinking of females as the bearers of young, but of course that seems to be only so among the higher mammals,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenbeld </PERSON>, executive producer and writer of `` The Nature of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'' and author of the companion book for the series. `` We tend to take a fairly species-centric view of evolution and the world about us. Most creatures in the world tend to reproduce in very, very different ways from the way we humans and most of the higher mamals do. We probably are an exceptional group rather than the other way around,'' <PERSON> Vandenbeld </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` It fascinates us because it's at such a variance with the way we look at things. It all makes perfect sense; it's all logical for sea horses and those kinds of animals to organize their reproduction in that way,'' said <PERSON> Vandenbeld </PERSON>, a long-time producer of documentaries on the environment for the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. The series episodes are `` A Separate Creation,'' how <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s wildlife came to be so different; `` Seas Under Capricorn,'' where the male sea dragon gives birth; `` The Making of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' for fans of man-eating crocodiles; `` The Sunburnt Country,'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s outback; `` Land of Flood and Fire,'' with crocodile-eating men; and `` The End of Isolation,'' how conservationists are trying to bring parts of the continent back from the brink of man-made `` Until not so very long ago, the idea most Australians had about the environment was of a very rugged, harsh and alien kind of place that you sort of had to conquer. There was a lot of fear and loathing of what we call the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> among the early settlers. And the only good tree was a tree that was cut down; the only good tree was a dead tree,'' said <PERSON> Holland-born </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenbeld </PERSON>, 48, who emigrated to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> when he was 15. `` That attitude obviously has changed dramatically over the last few years,'' he said. `` We have such a unique environment, absolutely unique plants and animals in many ways. It's a kind of repository for things that have disappeared in the rest of the world, and we still have the chance to keep many of these things.'' <PERSON> Vandenbeld </PERSON> also said he hopes the series will change attitudes about marsupials, mammals that raise their young in pouches. `` People tend to dismiss kangaroos, and marsupials generally, as rather second-rate animals because they organize their reproduction in what seemed for a long time as a kind of primitive way; an intermediate step between reptiles and birds who have eggs and mammals like us who bear live young,'' he said. `` One of the things we've been able to do in this series is to demonstrate just how very intricately marsupial reproduction is organized, how very precise the various facets of this reproduction are tailored to this particular environment and how well that reproduction is orchestrated.''

 As anyone who follows the retail industry can tell you, consumers just are n't spending the way they used to. Sales at many of the nation's biggest retailers have been slow for almost two years now. The retailers have learned to adjust, shifting the focus of their business from generating sales to maintaining profits. And the investment analysts who track retail companies are stressing cost controls rather than revenue. So, everything is OK, right? Maybe we do n't need to worry about how many refrigerators <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> sold last month or how the white sale went at <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Wrong, the economists say. The retailers may have figured out how to survive the slump, but the economy _ and the rest of us _ are likely to suffer in the end if consumers continue to hold tightly to their purse strings. `` Any kind of slowdown -LRB- in consumer spending -RRB- will show up in lower production and unemployment,'' warns <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, firm that forecasts economic trends. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's health. If consumers make fewer purchases, they could force the economy to slow down or even slip into a recession. So far, the slowdown in retail spending has not been readily apparent in the GNP figures. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said overall consumer spending increased by 3.5 percent from July through September, following a 3 percent rise in the second quarter, although at the same time, many big retailers reported their sales could n't keep up with inflation. What's happening is that Americans are spending more on other things: cars and the gasoline to drive them, interest payments on mortgages and other loans, medical care and their children's tuition. But, the economists note, as Americans pay more for necessities and services, they are shying away from what's known as discretionary spending _ purchases of clothing, dishwashers, furniture and other items they do n't really need. Therein lies the problem _ a drop in such spending means consumers are n't buying as many discretionary goods, so companies do n't have to produce as much. And if manufacturers slow their assembly lines, they're likely to lay off workers. What could save some of those jobs is continued growth in exports. But, as <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> noted, exports are not a panacea for the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing sector. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't sell many refrigerators overseas, so if the domestic market declines, some workers may be on the street. A slowdown is inevitable, according to <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>. `` The economy is expanding too rapidly,'' he said `` It ca n't continue to go on. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> board has been tightening credit _ raising interest rates in the process _ to try to put the brakes on the economy. But as rates rise, the cost of borrowing goes up _ leaving consumers with less to spend at department and discount stores. And so the cycle will continue. `` In the long run, the recession is going to occur,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s first months in office have restored a sense of calm to <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, wracked in recent years by political, economic and natural disasters. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, 53, a moderate leftist and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, took office in August, replacing his long-time political foe, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, a staunchly conservative and pro-U.S. leader. The mild-mannered <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> has spent time playing volleyball with reporters and officiating at local speedway races. He has even deserted his bodyguards to get shoeshines in this colonial city's shady plazas `` President <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> is not an autocrat enclosed in the presidential palace,'' government television ads proclaim, in an effort to draw a contrast with <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, who carried a Colt .45 pistol and took pride in his `` macho'' image. A recent poll of leading journalists indicated <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s major accomplishment so far has been `` restoring tranquility and avoiding repression.'' The language was a clear reference to <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>'s turbulent style of governing and the frequent charges of human rights violations made against his government The currency exchange rate, considered a key economic signal, has stabilized at about 485 sucres to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar after fluctuating wildly for the past year. Independent economists have praised recent government austerity measures to build up the nation's depleted foreign currency reserves and to a cut a huge fiscal deficit and record-high annual inflation of nearly 80 percent. In his inaugural address, <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> of lying about the seriousness of the country's financial plight and deliberately leaving it bankrupt to cripple his incoming government. This Colorado-sized nation of 10 million people, wedged between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, has suffered in recent years from severe economic problems and political instability. The turmoil was sparked in great measure by bitter disputes between <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> and left-leaning parties that controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which at one point debated impeaching him. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s fledgling democracy was threatened in 1986 by a military uprising led by Gen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazzos </PERSON>, then air force commander. The uprising failed and <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazzos </PERSON> was imprisoned. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> was kidnapped a year later by <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazzos </PERSON>' backers and held for 11 hours until he pardoned the jailed general. A devastating earthquake in 1987 that crippled the vital oil export industry for a half year and the collapse of international petroleum prices also had disastrous economic effects. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s fourth president since democracy was restored here in 1979, following a decade of military and civilian dictatorships. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s party, which is affiliated with the international Social Democrat movement, controls the 71-seat unicameral <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. This has virtually eliminated any possibility of the opposition blocking <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s policies, as occurred in the <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> has already made good on campaign pledges to seek closer ties with the Non-Aligned Movment -LRB- the Third World -RRB- and to replace <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>'s free-market economic policies with greater government controls. In one of his first official acts, <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> restored diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government, which had been severed during <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>'s era. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, in a rare visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was a prominent guest at <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s inauguration So was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> says he intends to maintain close relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s major trading partner. `` I believe there can be good cooperation between our government and the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. A government announcement in September of a plan to assume control of the petroleum production operations in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sparked concern in international financial circles of a leftist move to nationalize key industries. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> quickly acted to restore confidence, explaining that the government's intent was to gradually assume control over <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> operations as contracts expire. `` We are open to foreign investment in terms of mutual benefit,'' said Energy Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamariz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s austerity package, which included a 36 percent devaluation of the currency, exchange controls and gasoline price increases, has drawn its heaviest criticism from the left, however. The <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> government has also announced plans to renew debt negotiations with foreign creditors. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> has paid almost nothing on its $ 11 billion foreign debt since the 1987 earthquake.

<TEXT>
 The dollar fell in moderate European trading this morning in continuing bearish reaction to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential victory. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar fell in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and early European trading but recovered slightly as dealers bought dollars to cover short positions. Traders said the only factor preventing the dollar going lower was market fears of central bank intervention to prop up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> stepped in early today following intervention Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. But no action by European central banks was sighted this morning. `` There is still a bit of downward pressure, but the room on the downside is limited,'' one dealer at a large West German bank said. `` Because of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> interventions, the market is hesitant to sell dollars.'' A <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> trader said he expected a period in which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> markets would push the dollar lower, while European markets would be net buyers of dollars. He said the market was reacting to statements, rather than fundamentals, especially those by officials seeking to lay the groundwork for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s economic policy. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 124.10 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted lower at 123.88 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7595 West German marks, down from 1.7665; 1.4785 Swiss francs, down from 1.4865; 6.0059 French francs, down from 6.0460; 1.9839 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9935; 1,310.50 Italian lire, down from 1,319.50; and 1.2265 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2325 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7940, compared with $ 1.7890 late Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 422.15 a troy ounce and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 422.25. Both were down from Wednesday's late bid of $ 423.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 422.30, up from $ 420.00 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.91 to close at a bid $ 424.23.

 The dollar fell against the Japanese yen today, while share prices edged down on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar finished trading at 124.10 yen, down 0.55 from Wednesday's close of 124.65 yen. Opening lower at 123.95 yen, the currency ranged between 123.76 and 124.30 yen. It was the first time the dollar opened at the 123-yen level since April 18, when it started trading at 123.83 yen. Traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s intervention and buying by speculators near the 123.7-yen mark saved the dollar from declining further. The central bank routinely declines comment on its activities. Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said today `` the recent currency situation requires coordinated intervention.'' The present currency movements `` are n't good,'' he added. A dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said, however, the dollar's downward trend still was strong in the market The dollar was only slightly affected by Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election `` Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won as most market players had expected, many of them are now cautious, wondering how the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy will be after the election,'' the dealer said, speaking anonymously. Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 205.51 points Wednesday, lost 46.36 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 28,166.42. The index gained 86.22 points shortly after the market opened, then gradually fell. A dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> attributed the decline to profit-taking, mainly in electronics and high-tech issues. `` But the higher yen helped financial issues finish higher,'' he said, also speaking anonoymously. Trading was active with the volume on the first section estimated at 1.2 billion shares.

 Just after winning a 40-state election victory on a vow of no new taxes, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is giving some appearances of flexibility on that stand, at least on the topic of `` revenue enhancers.'' At his first press conference as president-elect on Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether his oft-repeated opposition to tax increases was meant to cover only a boost in personal income tax rates. While personal income taxes provide the bulk of the government's revenues, large sums of money are also raised by a variety of other taxes from gasoline levies to taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and from fees charged for government services Politicians who do n't like to talk about raising taxes sometimes say they would accept `` revenue enhancers.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether he would also categorically rule out `` revenue enhancements'' of any kind as a way of reducing the federal budget deficit. He essentially sidestepped the question, saying he would need a definition of a revenue enhancement before he could answer. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was dancing around the `` T'' word Wednesday, talk of higher taxes filled the air in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: _ <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested stripping away the tax deductions businesses now enjoy when they use borrowed money in corporate buyouts. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the huge corporate takeovers do not benefit the economy. He said the tax deductions on buyout loans were loopholes in the tax code which should be closed. _ Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> told a conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> that it will be politically impossible to balance the budget without tax increases. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said he believed income tax rates could remain unchanged but he suggested boosting the gasoline tax by 60 cents a gallon over the next four years and hiking taxes on alcohol and tobacco. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the high-level advisory panel created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come up with solutions to the deficit problem, announced a day-long hearing next Wendesday to launch its post-election effort at coming up with a combination of spending cuts and tax increases acceptable to the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. One of the leadoff witnesses will be <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who has already gone on record in favor of increasing gasoline taxes. Officials of the commission said they are awaiting word from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team on the names of the two individuals the president-elect will appoint to the panel. Many expect those appointments will tell a lot about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s intentions on grappling with the budget problem. In his meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that he had been attacked during the campaign for supporting higher taxes because of his endorsement of the catastrophic illness insurance legislation passed this year by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. As he did during the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted that the measure was not a tax increase even though the new law hikes the monthly Medicare insurance fee paid by Social Security beneficiaries and imposes an income-tax surcharge on wealthier retirees to pay for the expanded health benefits. `` I'm talking about holding the line on taxes, and I do n't plan to deviate, and I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people must have understood that when they voted in rather large numbers for my candidacy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Still, some private economists said they believed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vague answer on revenue enhancers signalled a shifting position. `` Eventually <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to have to back off of his commitment,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` The deficit problem has not been resolved and there are enormous pressures building for increased spending'' to fight the drug problem and bail out hundreds of insolvent savings and loan institutions, <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said. After dropping sharply in 1987, the budget deficit began rising again in the just-completed fiscal year, climbing to $ 155.1 billion, with many economists predicting it could climb above $ 160 billion this year.

<HEAD>Trade Surplus Climbs in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lower oil and textile imports in October helped boost <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus to $ 7.69 billion in October, up 13.09 percent over a year earlier but slightly lower than in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell for the 10th straight month from year-earlier levels to $ 4.83 billion in October, down 3.1 percent from $ 4.98 billion in the previous year but up from $ 4.65 billion in September. Exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose 7.9 percent from a year earlier to $ 8.34 billion, while imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> climbed 27.7 percent to $ 3.51 billion, the ministry said. Officials noted major increases in U.S.-bound exports of semiconductors and passenger vehicles. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports of semiconductors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> jumped 54.7 percent to $ 314 million, while vehicle exports grew 9 percent to $ 2.47 billion. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s total $ 7.69 billion trade surplus in October compared with $ 6.8 billion in October 1987 and $ 7.74 billion this past September. In August, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus was $ 4.94 billion. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports during October rose 13.2 percent from a year earlier to $ 23.38 billion from $ 20.66 billion, and imports also climbed 13.2 percent to $ 15.7 billion. After rising for 15 months from year-earlier levels, the nation's trade surplus reversed direction in July This trend raised concern among officials that the surge could aggravate trade friction. <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said weaker imports from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and lower crude oil prices were the main reasons for the faster-growing trade surplus. Crude oil prices averaged $ 11.92 per barrel in October, down 33 percent from a year earlier. Japanese customers bought less crude oil in the expectation that a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could further reduce global oil prices, the officials said, speaking anonymously. Crude oil imports fell 4.1 percent to $ 1.17 billion in October. Lower textile products from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> boosted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus with the region to $ 1.81 billion, more than twice the year-earlier level October's trade surplus exceeded the levels expected by local analysts and dealers in financial markets. Exports in October were figured at an average exchange rate of 132.04 yen to the dollar, compared to 144.50 yen a year earlier. Imports were pegged at 132.58 yen, versus 144.59 yen. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> measures its trade surplus on a customs-clearance basis, which includes freight and insurance costs on imports but not for exports. Its trade surplus would be higher if those costs were included in both categories.

<HEAD>Prices Flat; Drought's Effect Easing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wholesale prices remained flat in October after seven straight monthly increases as the cost of food fell for the first time since February, the government said today. Analysts said the stability in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index for the first time in eight months signifies a tapering off of the effects of the summer drought, which had sent food prices up 3.5 percent since May. Wholesale food prices, led by large declines for fruits, vegetables, bakery products, pasta, beef and cooking oils, fell 0.1 percent last month. That was their first decline since February, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Food prices had skyrocketed 1.2 percent in September. Seasonally adjusted energy prices rose by 0.3 percent last month after falling by 3.3 percent in September. Following sharp declines over the summer, natural gas rates jumped 4.6 percent last month while gasoline prices held steady and home heating oil prices fell 10.1 percent. Wholesale prices for goods other than food and energy were unchanged last month. Automobile, home appliance, drug and children's apparel prices fell. Prices rose for women's and men's clothing, household furniture, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages and prescription drugs Before seasonal adjustments, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s index for goods one step short of the retail level rose 0.6 percent to 109.3, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 at the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost $ 109.30 last month. That same marketbasket of goods would have cost $ 108.60 in September and $ 107.70 a year ago. The seasonal adjustment process is designed to remove predictable, periodic influences from the calculation of price changes. Analysts said the difference between the seasonally adjusted prices and real ones was primarily connected with the introduction of 1989-model automobiles. `` Because auto rebates -LRB- on 1988 models -RRB- were smaller than normal in September, price increases in October were less than seasonally expected,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, head of economic forecasting at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Also, price rebates began almost as soon as new vehicles reached dealers.'' Sticker prices on 1989 models were an average of 7.5 percent above what the 1988 models were selling for in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. But it put the value of quality changes such as government-mandated passive restraints, new corrosion protection and improvements in powertrains at $ 153.69 per vehicle, or 34.6 percent of the average $ 444.08 increase in price to dealers. Including seasonal variations intended to spread the increase associated with new models across the year, new car prices were calculated as falling 1.7 percent. Alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.6 percent on the wholesale level last month after declining by 0.3 percent in September. Women's and men's apparel costs were up 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent respectively while prices for children's clothing fell 0.3 percent after rising 0.6 percent in the back-to-school buying month of September. Prescription drug prices rose 0.4 percent and are now 9.3 percent above what they were a year ago. Cosmetics rose 0.5 percent on October but are only 2.9 percent higher than for the same month in 1987. Household furniture prices rose 0.8 percent last month and are 4.5 percent above what they were a year ago. Including a 0.5 percent decline last month, wholesale prices for household appliances have risen only 0.7 percent in the last year. Overall, wholesale prices for finished goods other than food and energy have risen 4.1 percent in the last 12 months, slightly less than a 4.5 percent increase in consumer prices over the same period. Energy prices on the wholesale level have fallen 5.9 percent over the year while food prices have risen a total of 4.5 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. In all, wholesale prices are 2.9 percent above what they were in October 1987. Price declines of 9.2 percent for fruits, 1.9 percent for vegetables, 5.8 percent for pasta, 0.9 percent for fish, 4.0 percent for cooking oils and 1.6 percent for beef and pork paced the 0.1 percent drop overall in wholesale food prices last month. Offsetting those large declines were increases of 1.9 percent for processed chickens, 8.0 percent for turkeys, 7.3 percent for eggs and 1.0 percent for canned fruits and vegetables. <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said the lower beef and pork prices reflect unusually large pre-frost slaughters because of high feed grain costs. Prices for intermediate goods further back in the production chain _ items such as plastic parts, cement, paints, fertilizers, lumber and chemicals _ also were flat in October but are 5.3 percent higher than they were a year ago. Raw material prices for crude products such as oil, agricultural commodities, scrap aluminium, iron ore and timber declined 0.1 percent last month and are only 0.5 percent above what they were a year ago, the department said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to sell its unprofitable South African subsidiary to <ORGANIZATION> Unidev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a South African holding company for an undisclosed amount. `` While we continue to be committed to contributing to social change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the long-term economic viability of the business can be better served with South African ownership,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>, which began operations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1964, will maintain a legal entity in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for continuing several education and community development initiatives, funded by a permanent trust, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> withdrew only from owning a subsidiary in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, not from doing business there. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> will continue to sell computers and services to South African customers through Unidev, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The company's Johannesburg-based subsidiary accounted for less than 1 percent of the company's 1987 revenue of $ 3.4 billion, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. The company's business involvement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had in recent years generated considerable criticism from church groups and some pension funds opposing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racially separate apartheid society.

 Stock prices were mixed in dull, early trading today with many investors reluctant to make commitments in the face of the market's uncertain direction. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.52 points at 2,123.76 at 10 a.m. EST, 30 minutes after the opening bell. Advancing issues lead declining issues by about 6 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 459 issues up, 384 down and 520 unchanged.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is taking a much-needed step as well as following a national trend by announcing it would trim 7,000 jobs _ some through layoffs _ in the next four years, analysts said. `` They definitely have too many people relative to other telephone companies,'' <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a telecommunications analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Wednesday after the company announced the planned cuts. `` It's also part of a broader trend in the industry ... everyone has been trying to cut costs and reducing through attrition early retirement,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> said the previously announced restructuring of its telephone operations would result in nearly 7,000 personnel reductions by 1992. The company said in a statement the reductions would come from staff functions that support local service operations. Total employment for <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic telephone companies and associated headquarters staff is about 85,000 and about 28,000 of those people are in staff positions. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to streamline its telephone operations in March to continue improving service quality and to become faster, more flexible and responsive to customer requirements. The company said some of the reductions would come from early retirement offerings. `` We expect as many as 2,000 people may take advantage of this -LRB- early retirement -RRB- option,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, group vice president of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` In addition, we have had a virtual hiring freeze in place throughout most of this year, so a number of already-vacant positions simply will go unfilled.'' He said some employees would be reassigned to positions in other <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> businesses. `` Some layoffs are inevitable, however, and will be used only as a last resort,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` The majority of these will come from our management ranks and will occur over time.'' The company would not project the number that would be laid off. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> projected that <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s plan could save them about $ 93 million a year for three years. He said that savings does not include severance costs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said `` These reductions are expected to generate substantial annual cost savings, which will be reflected over time in rate reductions to <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> customers and in improved earnings for <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> shareholders.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also said that additional reductions unrelated to this restructuring would occur over the next five years as the company institutes changes brought about by new technologies. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> had revenue of $ 15.4 billion in 1987. Its three core businesses _ telecommunications, lighting and precision materials _ employ about 161,000 people in 44 states and 38 other countries.

 Grain and soybean futures opened modestly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to an increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s corn-production estimate. In a report issued Wednesday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> raised its projection for the 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn harvest to 4.67 billion bushels, 3 percent above last month's forecast but still the smallest corn crop since 1983. Soybean production was forecast at 1.51 billion bushels, up 1 percent from last month's estimate but within the market's expectations The unexpectedly high corn estimate led to a weaker opening across the board, but wheat quickly turned mixed in response to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s downward revision of its world wheat production estimate, analysts said. `` The world production report indicated <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s wheat crops would be smaller than projected last month and those are major competitors, so that's positive for the wheat market,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.25 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.76 -RCB- a bushel; December oats, the only active contract in early trading, were 3 cents lower at $ 2.20 a bushel; soybeans were 2 \ cents to 4 cents lower with November at $ 7.92 -LCB- a Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle .02 cent lower to .15 cent higher with December at 73.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .18 cent higher with November at 81.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .33 cent higher with December at 40.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .38 cent higher with February at 44.30 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Super Collider Would Help Physicists Learn More About Particles of
Matter</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Super Collider Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The $ 4.4 billion super collider project involves building a 53-mile-long, racetrack-shaped tunnel, around which two beams of tiny particles would race in opposite directions. The purpose is to create head-on collisions. From the crashes, physicists hope to learn whether matter is made up of even smaller building blocks than those identified so far, and learn more about the particles of matter and the forces that act on them. The super collider would use some 10,000 superconducting magnets to guide the two beams of particles, called protons. It is called a `` super collider'' because it would accelerate the protons until they packed some 20 times the punch _ or kinetic energy _ that existing machines can create. At that energy level, a proton would have only about as much kinetic energy as a mosquito in flight. But a proton is extremely small: a row of 100 billion protons would extend the width of a human hair. So it packs its energy very densely, and the high density is what physicists are looking for. As the two beams of protons intersect in the super collider, most would pass through unscathed. But when a collision smashed a `` quark,'' or a building block, of one proton into the quark of another proton, a huge amount of energy would be released. The energy would turn into jets of tiny new particles, some of which may never have been observed before. The trajectories and other properties of the particles created in the collisions would then be studied for clues to the world of the very, very small.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> won a takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the flamboyant socialist tycoon silenced his doubters and took a giant step toward fulfilling his dream of creating a global communications empire. The success of his $ 2.6 billion bid for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishing and information services giant, after months of opposition, was sweet vindication for the 65-year-old British press baron. Although he had succeeded at smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> had failed in previous attempts to take over major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies _ namely <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. These highly publicized failures over the past few years had caused some Maxwell-watchers to question his goal of building <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into one of the world's top 10 media companies. Under the circumstances, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s public response to the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> victory was uncharacteristically subdued. `` I did n't feel anything,'' he said at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> press conference last week. It's a major responsibility that falls on my shoulders.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who is motivated in part by a desire to compete with his archrival, publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, said he plans further acquisitions as he tries to reach his revenue target of about $ 5 billion to $ 9 billion. The combined 1987 revenue of <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION>, of which he is chairman, and <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> is about $ 2.6 billion. Overcoming obstacles is nothing new to <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, a large, dashing man with swept-back black hair and bushy eyebrows over mischievous eyes. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was born <PERSON> Labji </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoch </PERSON>, the son of Lithuanian Jewish peasants who were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. Of his early life, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said in a recent interview on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> television: `` If you really want to know what it is like, you would have to go to <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> as it was.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> emigrated to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a teen-ager in 1940 and he says he arrived penniless, clutching a rifle and speaking no English. The self-educated <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who went to primary school for only three years, taught himself the language _ which he speaks with a distinctly upper class accent and in a booming voice _ and joined the British army. He became a captain and a war hero, winning the coveted Military Cross for bravery. In one episode characteristic of his ruthlessness at war, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> executed a German civilian, the mayor of a town, who had hoisted a white surrender flag to decoy <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s troops into an ambush by the German army. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s letter about it to his French-born wife said: `` I had a very amusing day yesterday ...'' In the TV interview, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> recalled the incident with regret, attributing it to his temper. `` I was 20 years of age and one treats the war as partially fun,'' he added in explanation of the letter to his wife. After the war, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> turned his attention to business and politics. He bought <ORGANIZATION> Pergamon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a publisher of scientific journals, in 1951, and launched a political career as a Labor member of Parliament. While some point to a contradiction in his socialist politics and capitalist ambitions, such questions have n't kept Maxwell from enjoying all the trappings of his wealth. He lives in a mansion near <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, and comes and goes from his offices near Fleet Street in a helicopter. He entertains on a yacht previously owned by the wealthy <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and he owns one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first-division soccer teams <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> says that when he was young, his mother blamed his father's and other men's joblessness on `` conservative politicians all over the world.'' `` And I have ever since then, never been able to support anything conservative,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s first really big business break came in 1981 when he bought the struggling <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest commercial printer, and turned it around. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> employs 17,000 people and had net earnings of $ 235 million on revenue of $ 1.6 billion last year. Ironically, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said after the <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> victory that he intends to sell the pivotal British commercial printing business and possibly other <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> assets to focus more on publishing. In 1984, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> bought the <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> _ which he holds privately _ winning control of a national newspaper, which had been one of his many ambitions. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s second-largest daily with a circulation of 3.25 million. It competes with the conservative Sun, the No. 1 seller with circulation of 4.1 million. The Sun is published by <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, at whom <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> constantly jabs. Although his <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> folded within months of its launch in late 1986, the undaunted <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> earlier this year announced plans to publish a newspaper called the European that would cover the continent. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> expects the paper to debut in the spring and attract 600,000 readers. He says he has been motivated through the years by a desire to `` make a small contribution to halting the retreat of these islands which has gone on for so long that the natives have forgotten that they are walking backwards.'' To say that <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> is patriotic is an understatement. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> became my home, virtually from the day I landed here, and I shall die here,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> loves <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, not all of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> loves <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. What puts many Britons' teeth on edge is his reputation for being a pushy self-promoter. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who has been dubbed `` Captain Bob'' by the British press, is often pictured in newspapers, frequently wearing a cap. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> lore has it that this self-made man long has yearned for acceptance, which he denies. `` I'm in the information and communications business and the media. Inevitably that carries with it the high profile you mentioned,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said in the TV interview. `` I do n't want admiration.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> says his biggest achievement is not business-related. Noting that he and his wife have been married 44 years and have seven children, some of whom work in the business, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said, `` I hope -LRB- the -RRB- major achievement you'll accept is really the family.''

 As the future leader of the world's largest economy, President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is making the adjustment from a seeker of people's votes to a weigher of their demands. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s biggest job from now until his inauguration is to plan an agenda for business and the economy that balances the competing needs and desires of all the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. It wo n't be easy. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> conducted interviews on the morning after the election with 13 Americans in business, and they predictably disagreed on their advice to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The interviewees ranged from the heads of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> to the leader of a bailed-out <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift, a cookie millionaire, a Weight Watchers franchisee and the operator of an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> grain elevator.

<TEXT>
 The president faces no challenge more important than keeping the economy strong. He has to make sure the economic expansion continues at a steady pace and work toward holding down inflationary pressures and interest rates. He should take steps to encourage increased savings and investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We have a 4 percent savings rate; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has a 17 percent rate. Savings is the key to stimulating innovation in the economy and creating jobs. As the baby boom population approaches retirement, the strains on the Social Security system will be unbelievable. We need tax incentives to encourage savings and investment.

 I'd like to see us compete in the world markets with our agricultural products. We have n't been able to do that until the last few years. We need to move products overseas and keep our production plants running. We know we're going to have to buy something from them if they buy from us. I want to see Third World countries developed in terms of buying our goods. We have to have some way to move products. We know the world needs that food, so we have to figure out ways to get it out of the country and still make it profitable for our country.

 The president certainly has to deal with the deficit. We ca n't continue to spend more than we make, and in that sense our government is n't a heck of a lot different from a household You can carry a certain amount of debt, but we're getting to the point where we have more debt than we can comfortably carry, and it's likely to have a material effect on interest rates ... It's terribly important that the administration understands that the financial services industry in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is in collapse _ it's not a problem, it's a collapse that's not going to get fixed with a Band-Aid. We should bring some sound and solid non-partisan thinking to this problem. He should execute a national housing policy that will enable lenders to provide loans for home buying. We're making loans, but we're not doing it successfully.

 The next president should put a stop to the open hostility toward unions that we've had from the past administration and the current <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took very one-sided, anti-labor positions that have crippled organizing drives and made it much more difficult for unions to represent members effectively. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> to be a neutral agency, and the president should seek to restore that neutrality. There also are a whole range of workplace issues ... like an increase in the minimum wage, a requirement that everyone who works receives minimum health care benefits from their employers, child care and parental leave packages and notification of potential health hazards for those working in a high-risk environment. It's shear baloney that this would interfere with competitiveness

 Basically the president has to make the assets of this country more productive, and if we do n't do that, we will fast become a second - or third-rate power We have to make top management accountable ... If top management does n't do the job, remove them. We need simple legislative changes like those that exist in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where if somebody wants to make an offer for a company, they have to have the capital. And a simple rule that if someone makes a credible bid for a company, shareholders should be given the right to vote on that offer. Management can recommend they reject the offer, but shareholders should decide. We should n't have to fight with poison pills, court cases, scorched-earth policies. Once you have a certain amount of stock and make an offer for a company, the shareholders vote ... In addition, pension plans should not be controlled by the corporation. Managers of the funds feel beholden to the company. What should be done is have a board of say, retired judges, people above reproach with no agenda, who are allowed to appoint pension managers, so if a manager votes -LRB- shares in the pension plan -RRB- against incumbent -LRB- management in a takeover -RRB-, their job is not threatened.

 The president has to recognize that women are a huge and permanent part of the work force _ they will outnumber men as workers in the next 20 years. There must be policies that reconcile their responsibilities at work and at home _ like child care and equal pay for part-time work so that part-time jobs are not a way to reduce labor costs but a way to fit the genuine needs for both management and workers. We need to increase the minimum wage at the very least _ the minimum wage currently pays less than the poverty level for a working couple. You will not build a strong work force that can improve its productivity on that basis. In addition, compared with our competitors, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has the lowest rate of literacy, and it's the only industrialized nation that does n't have a family leave policy. We also need minimum health insurance because so many workers are not covered by health care.

<HEAD>Texas Gets Collider, If It's Built</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> today announced the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as the site for the highly prized $ 4.4 billion super collider atom smasher _ if the giant research installation is ever built. Seven states had vied for the project because of the economic benefits tied to the construction of the collider, a 53-mile underground ring of 10,000 magnets capable of whipping proton beams together with 20 times the force of the world's most powerful existing particle accelerator. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site _ some 16,000 farm acres in <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> _ was `` superior'' to the others. The decision, he said, was based in part on site geology, regional resources and environmental criteria. `` The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> proposal clearly received the highest overall technical evaluation ratings of any proposal and exhibited no significant overall weaknesses,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. The six other contenders were <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. They were chosen from a field of 25 bidding states by an independent panel appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Officials of some of the losing states, however, linked <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' selection to Tuesday's election of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, as president ` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> made a decision ... based on politics rather than on merit and the good of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` I do not believe that the timing of this decision and its proximity to the election is a coincidence. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the decision `` has a strong smell of White House politics That was our major concern all along. ... We and the other five finalist states got a raw deal.'' But <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told reporters the selection was made purely on technical merits and added, `` I have to tell you there are no politics in this.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> and the unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, said today's announcement made this `` a wonderful day for our country and out state.'' He pledged as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to do `` everything in my power to guarantee -LRB- that -RRB- the funds for construction are appropriated on time. ... I am happy to have had a hand in bringing it about.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must now prepare a full-fledged environmental statement. Assuming nothing in the statement disqualifies the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> will make its selection final in January. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not yet appropriated money to build the collider, but did provide $ 100 million in the current fiscal year for engineering design and certain research and development items. In all, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated only $ 205 million for the collider. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the facility, if it is built, will be named the `` <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>'' because <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is the president who had the vision to move forward with the outstanding scientific project of this century.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, who announced his state's selection earlier in the day, called the collider `` the most important scientific project that will be built anywhere in the world in the last quarter of the 20th century.'' The project is viewed as a plum for its host state because of the economic benefits it will provide: thousands of construction jobs, permanent employment for as many as 3,000 people and an annual budget of $ 270 million. The contending states spent years and millions of dollars trying to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to put the project on their turf. Lobbying continued right up to the last minute. In an effort to attract the project, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters approved a $ 1.1 billion bond package that would reduce the federal cost of building the atom smasher south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The concept behind accelerators is not new; E.O. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> won a Nobel Prize for inventing the cyclotron in the early 1930s. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> project will be the most powerful accelerator ever built, taking advantage of the discovery that at close to absolute zero, or minus-450 degrees fahrenheit, certain materials lose all electrical resistance. The loss of resistance is called superconductivity. In the <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> accelerator, protons will travel toward each other from opposite ends of the machine and will collide at speeds up to 20 times those produced by the fastest existing accelerator outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. When the protons collide, they will break into smaller particles, called quarks, whose paths and behavior will be monitored closely as scientists explore the tiniest yet-discovered building blocks of the universe and the laws that determine their arrangement.

 Boosted in part by the drop in oil and natural gas prices, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> petrochemical industry is booming again. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plants are operating at full capacity along the Gulf coast, and are announcing expansions because they're running out of room to produce ethylene and other basic petrochemicals. The resurgence of the business comes at a time when the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy is feeling the pinch of lower crude oil prices. But like other `` downstream'' refining and processing operations, petrochemicals are benefiting from lower prices for raw materials. Petrochemicals are derivatives of crude that are used in a wide range of consumer and industrial products. The list goes on and on: plastic bags, automobile springs, water pipes, computer chips, paints, medicines, carpets, clothes, shoes, luggage, furniture, heat shields for rockets _ even diapers, made of polypropylene. `` In my opinion, it's the bright star in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy,'' said state Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says 70 plant expansions valued at a total of $ 4 billion have been announced for completion by 1991 from <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, a 250-mile stretch of coastline that supplies two-thirds of the nation's major petrochemicals. Some of the biggest include a $ 600 million Dow <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> ethylene plant at <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and three <ORGANIZATION> Quantum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ethylene and polyethylene projects worth $ 400 million in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The council said the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Formosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> plant at Point Comfort, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a $ 3 billion complex, is scheduled for completion by 1993 The project would create 1,500 jobs and have an annual payroll of $ 85 million. Analysts estimate that in so-called bulk chemicals, such as ethylene, a $ 1 million investment equals only one new job. But even so, the petrochemical industry `` pumped more than $ 2 billion in wages and salaries into the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy in 1987,'' according to the state comptroller's office. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, professor emeritus at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, called <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` the high-tech chemical center of the world.'' The initial petrochemical boom came with the need for synthetic rubber and antiknock gasoline in World War II. It grew until the 1970s when the Arab oil embargo and worldwide overcapacity set it back. The industry retrenched again during the 1981-82 recession, when the oil companies cut costs, closed plants and laid off workers. In addition to lower crude prices, a decline in the value of the dollar has contributed to the industry's recent recovery. Senior economist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaut </PERSON> of the comptroller's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar's 30 to 40 percent drop from the middle of 1985 to the beginning of 1987 helped revive the export business by making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petrochemical products more competitive in world markets. `` Out of something bad comes something good,'' observed <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, noting how when oil prices are down, petrochemicals pick up. Petrochemical exports from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in 1984 totaled $ 3.9 billion, 35 percent of the value of all manufacturing exports from the state, <PERSON> Plaut </PERSON> says. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had 45,749 jobs in petrochemicals in the first quarter of 1988, up 1,081 jobs, or 2.4 percent over the same period last year, the comptroller said. Another 30,000 Texans were employed in petrochemical-related jobs. According to <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> of A & amp; M, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> chemical industry and its associated consumer product industries support 11 percent of the nation's gross national product. The chemical engineering professor believes the chemical industry _ not computers, electronics, or space _ may be the best bet for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' economic future. However, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> says, the public perception of all chemicals as `` bottles of fuming, smelly liquids, or poisonous gases'' must be changed. `` In times past,'' he said, `` the industry's position -LRB- on risks -RRB- was not to say much _ ` Let the public relations guy handle it.' Now, the industry is much more public-conscious minded and feels it is better to tell all.'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> says continued petrochemical growth is expected throughout the 1990s, with a 65 percent increase in production over 1982 recession levels by 1995. The value of an $ 18 barrel of crude oil increases to $ 21 when converted in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to gasoline and $ 54 when converted to chemicals, he said. The figure ranges from $ 840 to $ 2,700 per barrel when the potential value of consumer products made with chemicals is estimated. Developing its own consumer product industry `` constitutes one of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' greatest opportunities,'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. Those industries would not have to be located near the chemical complexes but could be inland, in any part of the state. Such industries might produce furniture, wall coverings, textiles, bottles or paints. `` Everything that you lay your eyes on in a modern building came out of a chemical plant or was touched by chemicals,'' said <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A state judge today left intact the `` poison pill'' defense that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is using to try to thwart a $ 5.23 billion takeover bid by the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. But in denying a request from <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders that the food company's board be forced to drop the pill, <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> urged negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and its suitor. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> board must be left to do its own work, but it seems to this court that direct negotiations may be justified,'' he said. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said there were no legal issues that would prevent <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company, from negotiating the $ 60-a-share offer from Grand Met. The British firm also has asked that the pill _ which allows shareholders to buy <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock at a steep discount and raises the cost of a hostile takeover _ be removed so shareholders can consider its offer. But on Monday, retired Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied Grand Met's motion to suppress the pill. He ruled that, as of Oct. 17, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s directors had not abdicated their responsibility to shareholders in rejecting Grand Met's offer. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it was spinning off its Burger King restaurant division to stockholders, and Grand Met responded by renewing its motion before the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> denied Grand Met's request for a rehearing, but said he could still consider scheduling another hearing on the issue if Grand Met files new evidence. The poison pill would allow <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> to issue new stock that Grand Met would have to acquire to take control of the company. The cost of a takeover would rise to about $ 20 billion. Analysts differed on whether the poison pill could stymie Grand Met's takeover offer. `` The poison pill is a significant deterrent to closing the transaction,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cravath </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Swaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, Grand Met's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm. But <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s poison pill defense was a small bargaining chip. `` I would not anticipate that would hold much water, given the fact that 75 percent of the shares have been tendered anyway,'' he said. `` Frankly, I would anticipate the two companies to sit down and negotiate at the table.'' On Wednesday, Grand Met said nearly 63.4 million shares, or 74.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock, had been tendered under its offer. The British firm also increased the pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> by extending its offer, which had been scheduled to expire Tuesday night, until midnight Nov. 14. Analysts had speculated Grand Met would extend the offer to demonstrate to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> a strong showing among shareholders who have agreed to sell their shares. Grand Met had to say how many shares were tendered, or offered for sale, if it was to extend the buyout offer. With the offer extended, however, shareholders could take back their shares until the next Grand Met deadline. <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> said, `` I think -LRB- Grand Met -RRB- is continuing to apply pressure to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board. Grand Met is obviously dealing from strength here.'' `` I think the ball is back in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s court,'' he said. <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> said he expected the two companies will `` sit down and negotiate at the table.''

 Stock prices were little changed Thursday as the market continued to show a lack of direction.

Over one-quarter of the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index shares finished unchanged, `` an indication of the directionless state of our market at the moment,'' one market watcher said.

Volume was moderate, with 586.7 million shares changing hands, compared with the 522.5 million shares traded Wednesday. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> traders said the lack of direction from Wall Street kept British equities hemmed into tight ranges.

<TEXT>
 The government on Thursday blocked Elders <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> from buying any more stock in the British brewer Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breweries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The move came after the Australian-based Elders bought up 10 percent of stock following a government decision to investigate its hostile bid for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s fifth largest brewer. The government also blocked Elders, which now holds more than 24 percent of Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, from exercising the voting rights of more than 15 percent of Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION>'s stock Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> dramatically stepped in, and issued the orders under the Fair Trading Act after Elders confirmed it had sharply boosted its holding in Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> by purchasing about 35 million shares in the market Thursday. Elders made the purchases after <PERSON> Young </PERSON> referred Elders' 1.6 billion-pound, or $ 2.8 billion, offer to the <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to determine its effect on competition. Elders' bid, of 400 pence a share, automatically lapsed because of the referral. Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 16 pence to finish at 390 pence on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The target company complained `` with very grave concern'' about Elders' stock purchase, saying such actions were prohibited under British takeover regulations. `` Elders appears to be attempting to pre-empt the outcome of the monopolies commission inquiry,'' it said. `` Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> regard this situation as quite intolerable.'' Elders countered that it had not broken the rules. `` There is a brief window between the recommendation and the MMC actually sitting and reviewing the matter. It was during that window that we acquired the shares,'' according to a spokesman for Elders' Courage subsidiary, who was not identified in accordance with British practice Earlier, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, saying the bid `` raises questions of competition in the brewing, wholesaling and retailing of beer,'' asked the commission to report its findings within four months. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, Elders' chairman and chief executive, said he was `` shocked and disappointed'' by the investigation. Elders said the company would argue its case during the investigation in the hopes of being allowed to resume its bid. Elders already owns <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s sixth largest brewer, <ORGANIZATION> Courage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The acquisition of Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> would give the combined group a 21 percent share of the country's beer market, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Elders has argued that its takeover of Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> would increase competition in the brewing industry by presenting a more formidable rival to market leader <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 22 percent of the British market. The commission also has been conducting a long investigation into the British system of `` tied'' public houses, under which a brewer owns a chain of pubs and markets its own brands through them. That report is due to be completed Feb. 3.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it signed a definitive agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on their previously announced venture to jointly refine and market petroleum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will receive $ 812 million for a 50 percent interest in its refining assets and marketing system in 23 East and Gulf Coast states. The oil company said it expects to enjoy an additional $ 1 billion in cash benefits and savings resulting from the joint venture. The agreement, which was originally outlined in June, provides <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's biggest oil exporter, with a secure outlet for its products while virtually guaranteeing <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> a steady stream of crude at market prices. The joint venture will be known as <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> and will be headquartered in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The company will operate three major <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> refineries _ in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>.; Convent, La.; and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It also will operate about 1,450 owned and leased service stations and distribute products to more than 10,000 stations. It will employ 5,000 people and is expected to be in operation by Dec. 31. The Saudis will provide 75 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>' initial oil inventory The joint venture will retain the right to buy up to 600,000 barrels of crude from the Saudis each day at market prices. At the signing of the agreement in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> called the joint venture `` one of several major steps we have taken to restructure <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and to enhance shareholder value.'' Earlier this year <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. It has been selling off $ 5 billion in assets to offest the disastrous effects of prolonged litigation with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which resulted in the bankruptcy court reorganization and a $ 3 billion payment to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. The oil giant also survived a bitter power struggle with its largest shareholder, financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who attempted to acquire the company for about $ 14 billion. Observers have taken issue with the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> venture on the grounds that it raises questions about increased foreign leverage over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil industry, which has become increasingly reliant on imports. The venture is believed to be the biggest of its kind between a foreign supplier and a domestic oil company in the `` downstream'' end of the business _ the process for changing crude into gasoline and other products. The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government has hinted that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is interested in forming more marketing joint ventures. Oil industry sources said the kingdom was interested in linking up with European companies.

 Stock prices edged up in dull afternoon trading with little fresh news to give the market direction. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials inched up 0.71 points at 2,118.95 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator has floated aimlessly since the opening bell, from more than 5 points higher 30 minutes after the open to more than 6 points lower shortly after midday. Declining issues barely outpaced advancing issues on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 701 issues down, 645 up and 575 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was 102.36 million shares in light trading as many investors prepared for a three-day Veteran's Day weekend. Analysts said the market remained in a holding pattern with many players reluctant to make commitments in the face of economic uncertainty following the presidential election. In addition, concerns about the dollar and interest rates continued to plague the market. `` There are still a lot of questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening ... and that is keeping a lot of institutional investors on the sidelines,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market is very skiddish, very slow,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>.

 When government has sound economic policies and acts with fiscal sanity and allows the economy to grow in a non-inflationary way, I do n't see any need for special favors for any industry segment whatsoever. But we're not there now and we ca n't be with the budget deficit. If we are going to move forward into the next decade with the entrepreneurial renaissance that has captured the imagination of the world, we have to defuse the ticking time bomb of federal debt. The president should start by slowing the rate of government spending to match the rate of growth of the economy. There's a crying need for strong presidential leadership with a far stronger use of the veto. We need reforms in the budget process. We're putting our children irreparably in hock; we're approaching an economic point of no return.

 Perhaps the most important test of the next president's personal leadership will be his success in alerting all Americans to the urgency of our economic challenges. They revolve around the concept of deficits, and not just the twin deficits of trade and the budget. We are running serious deficits in productivity growth, capital investment, non-defense R & amp; D -LRB- research and development -RRB- and in the quality of education. Correcting these deficits is n't a job for one man alone, or one presidential administration. But I would hope that the next president has courage to lead us in that direction.

 Stock prices were mostly lower today as the market drifted up and down in dull trading marked by slim volume and lack of focus. Analysts said the market appeared to be in a holding pattern throughout the day with many players reluctant to make commitments in the face of economic uncertainty following the presidential election. In addition, concerns about the dollar and interest rates continued to plague the market. `` There are still a lot of questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening ... and that is keeping a lot of institutional investors on the sidelines,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market is very skiddish, very slow,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. Traders said this morning's flat wholesale prices as measured by the Producer Price Index for October had little impact on the financial markets. `` The market was looking for good PPI numbers. They were good but not great,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, head of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was not enough to make people come off the sidelines.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that wholesale prices were mostly unchanged after seven straight monthly increases, with food prices down for the first time since February. Analysts said the market traded in a narrow range, drifting up a few points then down a few points, and appeared to lack direction with little news to stir investor sentiment. Oil and auto stocks had a mostly positive session but recent takeover stocks changed direction during the day. Most stocks seemed to lack focus, traders said.

 The dollar fell in choppy trading Thursday as dealers continued to focus on the nation's looming trade and budget deficits. Gold prices also fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 418.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 422.50 late Wednesday. After plunging on Wednesday, the dollar continued to recede as the election earlier this week that will put Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the White House faded into a non-event for currency dealers. `` There's nothing to say,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market realizes we still have the same problems,'' a reference to the twin deficits. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said there was virtually no reaction to statements by Japanese and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials that there wo n't be a meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations before their already scheduled meeting in April. The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> finance ministers have worked to promote exchange rate stability. Despite its drop, the dollar held to a fairly narrow range in worldwide trading amid fear of central bank intervention and the feeling among some dealers that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency might be due for a technical bounce higher. `` The dollar still looks reasonably soggy, but I'm wondering whether it will kick back up at some point,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a corporate dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Comments by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> saying it would consider seeking help from the European central banks to support the dollar gave the currency `` a little lift,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvello </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But it drifted off again shortly after those statements,'' he said. `` A lot of people are still bearish on the dollar.'' Dealers said market attention was turning toward the next set of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, due on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 124.10 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted lower at 123.90 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar finished at 124.05 yen, unchanged from Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7970 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.7890 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.7975 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.7930. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7540 West German marks, down from 1.7635; 1.4745 Swiss francs, down from 1.4830; 5.9970 French francs, down from 6.0180; 1,307.00 Italian lire, down from 1.312.65, and 1.2217 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2312.

<HEAD>Gap Reports Big Third-Quarter Profit Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Gap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported its third-quarter profit jumped 43 percent from its severely depressed results of a year earlier. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings for the quarter increased nearly 50 percent, in part because of gains from the sale of real estate and its <ORGANIZATION> Loehmann </ORGANIZATION>'s specialty store division. Gap reported net income of $ 26.6 million, or 73 cents per share, compared with $ 18.6 million, or 52 cents per share, in the same period last year. Third-quarter revenue totaled $ 322.8 million, up from the $ 273.6 million reported for the comparable period in 1987. The results were a marked improvement over the dismal performance of third-quarter 1987, when Gap and other retailers began a year-long sales slump that decimated their profits. The retailers have shown signs of recovery in the latest quarter, but industry analysts are warning their profits may look stronger than they really are because of the comparison with last year's weak showing. Gap operates 887 stores, including 705 Gap, 108 <LOCATION> Banana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, 66 GapKids and eight Hemisphere outlets. May reported net earnings of $ 133 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with net earnings of $ 89 million, or 57 cents a share, for the same period last year. Revenue for the third quarter was $ 2.8 billion, compared with $ 2.4 billion in the same period of 1987. May's sale of the 76-store <PERSON> Loehmann </PERSON>'s chain resulted in a pretax gain of $ 47 million. Other unusual items that affected third-quarter results include a pretax gain of $ 18 million that occurred when the company dissolved a real estate partnership and a pretax gain of about $ 15 million from the sale of two parcels of real estate. May is one of the largest retailers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 3,047 stores, including <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s and Famous Barr department stores and the <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture discount store chains. For the first nine months of 1988, Gap reported net income of $ 42 million, or $ 1.15 per share, compared to $ 47.9 million, or $ 1.34 per share, for the same period last year. Revenue for the nine months totaled $ 828.4 million, compared to $ 702.4 million for the same period last year. May said its year-to-date earnings totaled $ 258 million, or $ 1.74 a share, on revenue of $ 7.69 billion, compared with earnings of $ 214 million, or $ 1.38 a share, on revenue of $ 6.93 billion for the same period last year.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Oct. 31, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,040.2 billion in the week ended Oct. 31 from $ 3,035.6 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,869.6 billion from $ 3,867.1 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 784.4 billion from $ 780.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 1.179 billion in the week ended Nov. 2, compared with a decline of $ 258 million in the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 283.5 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 283.2 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Mortgage Bankers Urge Bush To Cut Deficit, Even Raise Taxes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Bankers who lend money for housing urged President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday to take early steps against rising home mortgage rates and said they favor a broad-based tax increase if necessary to ease the deficit and save the housing market. `` We hope ... that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, as a last resort, will not foreclose the option of raising new revenues if necessary to bring down the deficit,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has to find a way to step away from his read-my-lips philosophy,'' said <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge not to raise taxes. But <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON> told a news conference that housing lenders would oppose any effort by the administration or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate or reduce the income tax deduction home buyers can take on their mortgage interest. He said such a move would be a tax increase. <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON> said the association, which represents 2,800 mortgage companies and other lenders, hopes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will give increased attention to housing in line with his promise for a `` kinder, gentler nation.'' He said the new president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have `` an opportunity to weave a stronger thread of home ownership and housing opportunity into the social fabric of the nation.'' The association says home ownership is declining in relation to the population, with eight percent fewer families headed by men and women between the ages of 30 and 34 owning homes now than did when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was first elected in 1980. It also says home buying takes a bigger bite out of family income, rents are higher, low-income housing is scarcer, vacancies are higher among high-income units, and 9.5 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families live in substandard housing. <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for failing to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or with state and local officials to combat the housing problem. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been negligent in recent years in not attending to the fact that housing and community building are to be carried out with governors and mayors,'' he said. <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON> noted that interest rates on home mortgages have been creeping up in the past week and said they could reach 11 percent by the end of the year, further slowing housing markets. Increases in the amount of public and private debt tend to push interest rates up, and <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become a nation `` addicted to debt.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first priority for benefitting housing should be to decrease the deficit. `` Nothing affects housing affordability more than interest rates,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> beat out six other states Thursday in a high-stakes race to capture the $ 4.4 billion superconducting super collider, which, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finds the money to build it, would be the largest scientific instrument ever constructed. The announcement by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> drew immediate howls of protest from losing states, where officials had waged a years-long battle to win the giant atom-smasher and the jobs and scientific prestige that will accrue to the project's home state. `` The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> decision has a strong smell of White House politics,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` We and the other five finalist states got a raw deal. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials also were angered, with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> calling on the president to review <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s decision declaring <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> the preferred site for what the department will name the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> Eight senators _ <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> _ asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to establish a bipartisan commission of physicists that would review all seven of the finalist sites. The others sites are in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The senators said if the project `` is to have the slightest chance of being funded,'' the president must demonstrate the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> decision `` was based solely on scientific criteria utilizing a fair, open and competitive bidding process.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said his state `` should be proud of its efforts. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site _ some 16,000 farm acres in <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> _ was `` superior'' to the others for building the collider, a 53-mile underground tunnel capable of whipping proton beams into each other with 20 times the force of the world's most powerful existing particle accelerator. `` The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> proposal clearly received the highest overall technical evaluation ratings of any proposal and exhibited no significant overall weaknesses,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site would best `` permit the highest level of research productivity and effectiveness'' at a reasonable cost of construction and with minimal impact on the environment. `` I have to tell you there are no politics in this,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told a news conference attended by such prominent Texans as House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, both Democrats, and Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a Republican. The decision was announced two days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an adopted Texan, was elected president. Questions remain whether money ever will be appropriated to build the super collider, an unprecedently powerful machine that physicists hope will help them explain the very origin of matter itself. Many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> argue the project will starve other more useful scientific research. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has kept the project on a short leash, and only agreed to provide $ 100 million this year for research and engineering design. None of that may be used for construction. Nonetheless, states eagerly sought the projects, which is expected to create 3,000 scientific jobs and 3,500 construction jobs, great prestige and a non-polluting industry with untold scientific spinoffs for the host state. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the collider is absolutely necessary to keep scientific leadership in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Most of the leadership in high-energy physics is headed for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We need to keep those people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The collider will put `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on the cutting edge of high-energy physics,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. He pledged as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to do `` everything in my power to guarantee -LRB- that -RRB- the funds for construction are appropriated on time.'' The department now must prepare a full-fledged environmental impact statement. Assuming nothing in the statement disqualifies the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> will make the selection final in January. The department's site selection task force did not compare the sites but found that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site was the only one rated outstanding on the four most important criteria. Those were geology and the ease of tunneling, regional resources such as schools and access to airports, environmental problems and site problems such as acquisition of real estate. On the other two important criteria, site conditions such as vibration and utility service, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was rated good, one notch below outstanding. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> had three `` outstanding'' ratings, but was rated only `` satisfactory,'' below good, on regional resources. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had two `` outstanding'' ratings each. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was about in the middle of estimated costs of building the collider and operating it for 25 years. The department estimated the total at $ 10.8 billion in 1988 dollars for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, possibly as low as $ 10.4 billion for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and as much as $ 11.5 billion for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with the others somewhere in between. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, an Illinois Democrat, charged the administration was using the super collider as a `` political tool.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> made a decision based on politics rather than on merit and the good of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` I do not believe that the timing of this decision and its proximity to the election is a coincidence.'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said all states had asked that the selection be delayed until after the election, and that the department was confident that any examination of the decision would show that it was not politically biased. The report of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> rated <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> `` poor'' on real estate factors, the only such ranking given. The report noted `` strong landowner opposition'' in the area and limited land acquisition expertise by state authorities. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the facility will be named after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> because he `` is the president who had the vision to move forward with the outstanding scientific project of this century.''

 Corn production is expected to total 4.67 billion bushels this year, 3 percent above last month's forecast but still a drop of 34 percent from the 1987 crop, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports. The searing heat and lack of rain was reflected in an average yield per acre of 83.2 bushels for corn forecast Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. That was down 37.1 bushels from last year but 2.1 bushels above the level contained in last month's forecast. As farmers struggled to bring the last of the corn out of the fields, the falloff in production reflected last summer's fierce drought.

<HEAD>Copper Plummets On Possible Peruvian Mining Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices plummeted Thursday on reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had reached a labor agreement with its white collar and clerical workers and was nearing settlement of a 3 -LCB- - week-old miners' strike On other markets, precious metals prices also fell sharply; soybean futures plunged while grains finished lower; livestock, meat and energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. The spot copper price on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell 8.75 cents _ the steepest one-day decline in the Comex spot copper contract since Feb. 1 _ to $ 1.4325 a pound, more than 10 cents below the record high of $ 1.538 established on Nov. 2. The most active contract, for delivery in December, tumbled 8.85 cents to $ 1.3675 a pound. The sell-off was prompted by a midday report that <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest copper-mining firm in the world's sixth-largest copper-producing country, had come to terms with striking clerical and white-collar employees, analysts said. The company's miners remained on strike but company officials reportedly said they may reach an agreement with them by Monday. The workers have been on strike since Oct. 18. Earlier in the day, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peru </ORGANIZATION> declared `` force majeure'' on shipments of 3,000 metric tons of copper to <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> customers, meaning it would be unable to honor those commitments, and said shipments of another 4,000 metric tons would be delayed. But the copper market failed to rally on that ostensibly bullish news. The strike has been a major factor in the copper market's surge to record highs. And while worldwide supplies are expected to remain tight well into next year, the market's behavior may indicate that the dramatic rally has peaked, analysts said. `` Whether they're moving close to a settlement or not, this raises a flag: has the top been put in or not,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metals market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Today feels more like we've topped than any other day we've had,'' he said `` This is how the market acts when it's at the top.'' Precious-metals futures prices also fell sharply, partly on profit-taking ahead of the Veterans' Day bank holiday on Friday and partly in reaction to a rise in short-term interest rates, analysts said. On the Comex, gold settled $ 4.10 to $ 4.50 lower with December at $ 420.50 a troy ounce; silver was 13.7 cents to 14.6 cents lower with December at $ 6.44 a troy ounce. Soybean futures prices plunged on heavy selling near the close of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, dragging down wheat and oat prices and spurring further declines in an already weak corn market. The collapse apparently was triggered by a massive sell order from the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a large commodities brokerage firm that had purchased about 5 million bushels of soybeans early in the session and sold them all back shortly before the close, analysts said. The corn market had been weak all day in response to a slight increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate for 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn production. Wheat settled 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at 4.24 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 5 cents lower with December at $ 2.74 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -RCB- cents to 7 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.15 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 13 cents to 27 \ cents lower with November at $ 7.73 a bushel In livestock and meat futures trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .03 cent higher with December at 72.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .23 cent higher with November at 81.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .70 cent lower to .55 cent higher with December at 40.72 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .53 cent lower with February at 44.12 cents a pound. In energy futures trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 12 cents higher with December at $ 13.98 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to .72 cent lower with December at 43.88 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .14 cent to .26 cent higher with December at 47.40 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures gained slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stocks settled .10 point higher at 274.15.

 The market turned in a mixed performance Thursday in what some analysts said was a dull, uninteresting day on Wall Street with little to stir investors. `` Nobody had any conviction to do anything, to be aggressive buyers,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Short-term, the market is trying to find its footing.'' Analysts said the problems that plagued the market before Tuesday's presidential election _ the dollar, interest rates and the deficits _ returned to prey on investor confidence. Those concerns kept institutional investors on the sidelines. `` They're concerned that they have lots of cash, but they're uncertain of the market's direction given the changing of regimes,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` So they do n't want to make any major commitments. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 3.55 to close at 2,114.69 after drifting in a narrow range. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 128.92 million shares, down sharply from 153.14 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 156.162 million shares. Advancing issues barely outnumberedterms of what we need to do,'' he said. `` They are lazy targets.'' <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, advocated `` ecological equity'' in which the industrialized nations chiefly responsible for polluting the atmosphere would cut back more than Third World countries on emissions that harm the ozone layer. Equity was one of several philosophical issues raised at the conference. The <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> Manifesto does not point fingers at those responsible for the pollution or say who should clean up. It concentrates instead on measures that would slow the melting of polar ice caps and destruction of the ozone layer, which some predictions say will occur by the middle of the next century. <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpe </PERSON>, chairman of the drafting committee, said the conference would reassemble in two years to evaluate how well the recommendations had been followed. He is a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dortmund </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>. In its first draft, the Manifesto did not set pollution limits or specific objectives for reducing harmful emissions that cause the greenhouse effect. Under pressure from Third World representatives and environmental groups, conference organizers inserted words specifying the aim of reducing cardon dioxide emissions 30 percent by the year 2000 and 50 percent by 2015. Third World delegates represented about 10 percent of the participants. When they sent the organizers a message saying they still were dissatisfied with the document, <PERSON> Karpe </PERSON> said another version addressing their concerns would be issued later. A report last month by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> echoed other warnings that average temperature would rise as much as four degrees in the next 50 or 60 years. Atmosphere specialists say such a rise would be enough to parch existing farm belts, cutting crop yields by up to 25 percent. Water and energy shortages also are forecast, along with more frequent floods, drought and violent storms.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices rose slightly Thursday, on speculation that central banks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would help prop up the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond rose -LRB- point, or $ 1.25 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction and is an indicator of interest rates, fell to 8.98 percent. Bonds received relatively little support from a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that wholesale price inflation slowed to zero last month, traders said. Low inflation preserves the value of fixed-income securities, and a report of flat prices usually buoys the bond market. But after a brief uptick following the morning report, prices fell back. Traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond market had trouble absorbing primary dealers' sales of three - and 10-year notes that they had bought at auction earlier in the week The rumor that helped the bond market was that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would ask European central banks to join it and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in supporting the value of the dollar, according to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Plocek </PERSON>, chief economist of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Crisanti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Maffei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The one item that will be required to turn dollar psychology around is coordinated intervention,'' <PERSON> Plocek </PERSON> said. Prospects of a declining dollar cause investors to flee from dollar-denominated securities. Despite the rumor, the dollar finished the trading day unchanged against the Japanese yen and slightly lower against other major currencies. <PERSON> Plocek </PERSON> said bonds were also helped somewhat by cuts in short-term interest rates by the Japanese and West German central banks. In the secondary market for existing <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues slipped 1-32 to 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were unchanged, and 20-year issues rose 3-16 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.12 to 1,144.21. Corporate bonds also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.18 to 294.85. Municipal bonds edged upward. The Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index of 40 long-term, investment-grade issues rose to 91 -RRB- from 91 \ Yields on existing three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, rose to 7.90 percent as the discount rose 8 basis points to 7.65 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.21 percent as the discount edged up 4 basis points to 7.79 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.38 percent with the discount up 3 basis points at 7.80 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 \ percent, unchanged from late Wednesday

 Foreign investors, wielding burgeoning influence over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, will give President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> two months at most to get a grip on the troublesome federal budget deficit, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research institute warned Thurday. Meanwhile, the administration unhappily projected the fiscal 1990 deficit at $ 132 billion, up $ 21 billion from its forecast just three months ago, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was nominated, and $ 32 billion over the legal limit allowed without new taxes. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, echoing concerns by private economists and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business leaders, said that without quick action by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to reduce the budget deficit, the country could face a financial crisis and possible recession as foreign investors pull out. `` The precarious international economic and financial position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> represents the most serious threat to the country's continued economic expansion and financial stability,'' the institute said in its new book, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the World Economy.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now forced to look abroad for more than $ 100 billion in new foreign loans and investment each year, the book noted. If the new administration appears headed for further stalemate on the budget deficit, foreigners might suddenly decide the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was no longer a good investment opportunity, said institute director <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>. A panic by foreign investors could send the dollar into a tailspin and seriously threaten <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> well-being, <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON> said. He noted that that foreign investors' fears have been cited as a primary cause for the `` Black Monday'' stock-market plunge of October 1987. Without a concerted effort to get the budget under control, <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON> forecast `` a sharp fall in the dollar _ as much as 20 percent to 25 percent. Inflation, double-digit interest rates. Recession.'' <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON> said foreigners are likely to turn pessimistic quickly if deficit reduction is not made a primary goal during the traditional honeymoon period when an administration's powers of political persuasion with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are usually highest. `` By Easter -LRB- March 26 -RRB- we'll be well on a good road _ or in the soup,'' said <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, a former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary for international finance during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. The institute said that in addition to eliminating the federal budget deficit, the new administration must step up efforts to encourage other major countries to buy more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and develop ways to improve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitiveness. One primary worry with the budget deficit is that it has begun rising again. After falling sharply in 1987 because of a one-time windfall in revenues from tax reform, the deficit for the fiscal year which ended on Sept. 30 climbed to $ 155.1 billion and many economists are predicting this year's deficit could top $ 160 billion. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the rest of the Cabinet were presented with the glum news Thursday that the estimated deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, has climbed to $ 132 billion. That is up from an estimate of $ 111 billion made by the administration's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> just three months ago. Since the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law sets a deficit target of $ 100 billion, that means the administration will have to come up with $ 32 billion in spending cuts to meet the target or face the prospect of raising taxes. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said that there was no intention in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last budget to propose a tax increase or cuts in Social Security. `` We have some difficult choices ahead'' on where to cut spending, she said. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> stressed the need for quick review of this year's budget submission in order to meet a Jan. 9 deadline for presenting it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in briefing reporters on the Cabinet meeting. With estimates on future deficits rising, many private economists convinced that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be forced to accept some type of tax increase despite his oft-repeated opposition to new taxes during the campaign. They note the public demands for the government to do more in the fight against drugs and estimates topping $ 50 billion for the cost of bailing out hundreds of insolvent savings and loans institutions as examples of new spending pressures. `` The deficit problem has not been resolved and there are enormous pressures building for increased spending,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a private forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Eventually <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to have to back off of his commitment'' of no new taxes. At his first press conference as president-elect on Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave some appearances of flexibility on the subject of what he would consider prohibited taxes. He referred to a new surtax on high-income elderly enacted this year as a way of financing the new catastrophic health-care program and said, `` I do n't think it was'' a tax increase. He also refused to rule out categorically so-called revenue enhancements, the euphemism politicians often use in referring to increased taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would have to see a definition of what revenue enhancements were being considered before he could make a decision. Also giving economists hope for resolution of the problem are wide expectations that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will name <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as the new head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, a long-time aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, is considered a pragmatist who would seek to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in crafting deficit-cutting solutions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must soon make known his two appointments to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the high-level advisory panel, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come up with a blueprint for eliminating the budget deficit. Many believe those appointments will tell a lot about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s intentions on grappling with the budget problem.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> handed its employees more unwelcome news Thursday, saying it expects to eliminate about 14,000 jobs in its domestic telephone operations over the next five years. In addition to the 7,000 jobs it announced Wednesday it would eliminate as a result of streamlining, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> said an equal number of positions would be lost as a result of factors unrelated to the streamlining program. `` It's really business-as-usual occurrences. As you become more proficient and learn to do things in better ways, you have some down-sizing,'' said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Barns </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Stamford-based corporation. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> executives discussed the planned cutbacks during the company's biannual meeting with analysts at the corporation's management development center in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> On the eve of the meeting, the company had announced that restructuring of the telephone operations would reduce the size of the workforce to a total of about 78,000 by 1992, in part through offering early retirement incentives. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> said virtually all of those reductions would come from the ranks of the 28,000 employees in staff and headquarters management positions. The company had also said additional reductions would occur as a result of changes unrelated to restructuring, mainly cost-cutting and new technologies. But it did not indicate the size of that cutback until Thursday. The cutbacks will not be limited to staff positions, as are the reductions that will result from restructuring, Barns said. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> had announced plans in March to streamline its telephone operations to continue improving the quality of service and to become faster, more flexible and responsive to customer requirements.

<HEAD>Pepperell Seeks To Block Farley Offer; Farley Says Law
Unconstitutional</HEAD>

 A federal judge said Thursday he could rule by Monday on some of the issues raised by lawsuits in <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s attempted $ 1.4 billion hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> West-Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> heard arguments from attorneys for <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, which has asked the court to block <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s $ 48 a share tender offer as illegal, and for <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, which wants <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s new anti-takeover law <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> claims the offer by <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, which controls 9.8 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s stock, includes too much debt and not enough equity in violation of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> margin regulations. It also contends that by participating in the deal, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is violating a standstill agreement it made earlier this year with <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has asked <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> for a preliminary injunction blocking the offer. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> claims <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law hinders interstate commerce via provisions allowing `` poison pill'' takeover defenses and others forcing a hostile suitor to purchase 90 percent of outstanding stock except in certain instances. <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> became the nation's largest publicly-owned textile company earlier this year after it acquired the bed and bath operations of <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc The transaction forms the basis for much of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s attempt to block the tender offer by Chicago-based <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, whose subsidiaries include the manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom underwear. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s claims involving <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> stem from the firm's role as financial adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> in its battle with <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> over <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The two sides eventually agreed to split <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> holdings between them. During negotiations leading to that arrangement, <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON> agreed not to share confidential information received as part of the bidding process and agreed not to try to acquire parts of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> until after March 3, 1989. The agreement stipulated that any of Odyssey's advisers agree to the same restrictions before being given access to any of the information. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was bound by those requirements, even though it did not sign the agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, contended the agreement was dissolved by subsequent merger agreements between <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and Odyssey. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> set up a `` Chinese wall'' so none of the people involved in the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> deal participate in the <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> offer. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON> attacked <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover statute, which was passed this year. The law is patterned after a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> takeover statute that has been upheld, but which has slightly different provisions. It allows companies to adopt takeover defenses that make it prohibitively expensive to undertake a hostile buyout. The law also says a suitor that does not acquire 90 percent of a target company's outstanding stock may not complete the takeover for five years

<HEAD>Christie Hefner Elected Chairman, CEO; Company Returning To Free
TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice chairman <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> was elected chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, one day after the company revealed plans for a new half-hour nightly show on free television. Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, 36, succeeds her father, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, at the helm of the Chicago-based publishing, video and merchandising company. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> announced in September he would not seek re-election as chairman and chief executive, and the company stated Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> was expected to be elected to those posts. She joined <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 as a special assistant to her father, has been running the company's day-to-day operations since being named president in 1982. She was named vice chairman of the board in 1986. Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> has been credited with reversing the company's early-1980s decline by selling off its unprofitable businesses and restructuring its video and merchandising divisions On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to return to free television with its first syndicated series since `` Playboy After Dark'' went off the air in 1970. The new show, to be called `` After Hours,'' will be offered to television stations around the country in fall 1989, according to <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s video entertainment group. The video division, which produces adult programs for the company's 6-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> on cable television, has formed a unit called <ORGANIZATION> Alta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> to produce `` After Hours,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> also might try its hand at mainstream fare, possibly including a children's show, for broadcast or cable television. He said `` After Hours'' will have a magazine format, with segments of comedy and music. The show's host will be a never-fully-seen director who will cue segments from the studio control room. The ghost of a host is a departure from the prominent role <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> played on `` Playboy After Dark,'' which appeared for two seasons. On that show, <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> was the host of a party, chatting with celebrity guests and entertainers on a set that looked like a living room and den. Playboy's return to regular television comes as it is trying to revive the Playboy Channel on cable. The company is offering some R-rated programs in that effort.
