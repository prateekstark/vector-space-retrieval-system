 Honduran troops on Wednesday surrounded about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers who entered the country chasing Contra rebels, military intelligence sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. They said the Sandinista troops had crossed about 3 miles into the Honduran border province of <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION>, east of the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, and had remained in the area for 24 hours. One official, who asked not to be identified, said the Nicaraguan troops `` have been surrounded by our army ... and we are only waiting superior orders to enter into action.'' `` There really is tension and there is crisis, however we are acting with prudence but with strength in these affairs, and we hope that everything will stabilize in the next two days,'' he said. The Honduran military went on alert, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' president, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcono </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, contacted Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to demand the withdrawal of the troops <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has not confirmed the presence of Sandinista soldiers in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has denied any incursion. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was dispatching 3,200 soldiers to southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to carry out training exercises and to be `` a signal to the governments and the people of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He said they would not enter any combat zones. Earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> had asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for help in dealing with an invasion. Intelligence officials said the Sandinista troops apparently entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to destroy a base camp of the U.S.-backed Contras. `` We have done everything possible to avoid a confrontation that would drastically affect ... both countries,'' one source said. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the country's highest military body, was in session most of the day, the officials said. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> met for about six hours behind closed doors to discuss the situation with top officials and the armed forces military chiefs. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference that the military command was reviewing battle plans in case the Sandinista forces continued occupying Honduran territory. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny that Nicaraguan troops had encroached on Honduran soil. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> did not comment on reports that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was dispatching <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want to create a national panic. We only ask our compatriots to have confidence in the government and in the armed forces,'' he said. The foreign minister added that <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> had demanded that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> order the `` withdrawal of the troops because they are raising tensions and producing insecurity in the border.'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> also asked presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to appeal to <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` to abstain from bringing about aggressive military actions against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said. `` The government and the army are ready to put into action the right of legitimate defense,'' the foreign minister declared. Military intelligence sources said that at least 2,000 Sandinista troops were inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and that another 4,500 were near the border in the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> region.

 A man who fired guns and grenades from behind a tombstone killed three people and wounded 68 at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> graveside service Wednesday before enraged mourners cornered and beat him. Young Catholics rioted in the streets afterward. <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police arrested the gunman at the end of a wild chase over graves in the <ORGANIZATION> Milltown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> cemetery during which he hurled grenades at the pursuing mourners and fired until his gun jammed. They identified him as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a Protestant, but gave no other information about him. Thousands of mourners screamed and dived for cover when shots shattered the silence of the cemetery in early afternoon, as the coffins of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members killed by British soldiers in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> were being lowered into a single grave. A companion of the attacker fled in a van parked nearby, and police said they captured him in another part of the city. Both men can be held without charge for seven days. Police provided no details on the second man. Mainstream Protestant organizations disavowed the attack. The Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said all `` right-thinking Protestants'' would condemn the attack `` without any ambivalence whatsoever.'' The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> said an anonymous caller claimed responsibility Wednesday night on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, but gave no recognized codeword to establish authenticity of the claim. The little-known extremist group has claimed responsibility for numerous sectarian assassinations. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> youths ignored government and church appeals after the attack and rioted through the evening. They burned hijacked buses and other vehicles and blocked streets with flaming barricades. Palls of smoke hung over the Catholic ghettos of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Police said they fired plastic bullets at rioters who fired a shot and threw stones at a police patrol in the <LOCATION> Ardoyne </LOCATION> district of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, the province's second city, one car was hijacked and set ablaze in the Catholic Bogside district. Police identified the three people killed Wednesday as <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McErlean </PERSON>, 20; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 26; and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 30. All came from Catholic areas of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. One of those wounded at the cemetery was in critical condition and four were in seriously wounded, said a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Most victims were shot or hit by shrapnel while scrambling for cover during the melee, which lasted about five minutes. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, blamed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary groups and accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of collusion. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, aides of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she was `` shocked and appalled.'' Her government denounced the attack as `` insane and depraved.'' It appealed for calm, as did <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, church leaders and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Police, the British government and the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> vigilante groups, and the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> denied involvement. The largely <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is waging a guerrilla war to drive the British from Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary groups have grown up to fight it. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It's obvious it was an attack by Loyalist -LRB- Protestant -RRB- movements. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said: `` There was collusion between elements with the British Crown forces, probably the Royal Ulster Constabulary -LRB- provincial police -RRB-.'' Police said they deliberately kept away from the funeral because of assurances that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> would not turn it into a paramilitary display. Commandos in civilian clothes killed the guerrillas, <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, on March 6. British officials said the three were on a mission to bomb a military ceremony at the colony. Mourners were lowering Miss <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>'s flag-draped coffin into the grave when a bearded man opened fire 15 yards away from behind a gravestone. Young men yelled `` There he is! There he is!'' and the thickset gunman bolted. His cap fell off as he reloaded his pistol, and still dodging and weaving, he fired at the youths and hurled two grenades while taunting the pursuers to keep coming, witnesses said. `` I saw a young man throwing things from the back of the mourners,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who was saying prayers beside the open grave. `` I thought they were stones, but it looks as if they were grenades. He was also firing shots into the crowd. There was absolute chaos.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the two men involved in the attack entered the cemetery carrying bags and cameras and were mistaken for journalists. The attack occurred after moderate <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrie </PERSON> was ousted as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Hardliners accused him of weakening the armed fight against the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. More than 2,600 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s sectarian violence since August 1969

<HEAD>Window Nearly Mistaken As Trash Identified As A Tiffany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 9-foot-tall stained glass window that was headed for the trash heap after being found in a church garage here was made by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>, an expert says. `` There's no question in my mind whatsoever that it's <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, who owns a stained glass studio in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and is the author of numerous published articles about the craft. `` It's a glorious find.'' The window depicts the figure of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and features examples of drapery glass, a technique unique to <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> about 1905 when the piece was made, <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> said. He said the window's intricate leading and the plating of glass in multiple layers caused him to suspect right away it was by <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>, who lived from 1848 to 1933 and was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most famous stained glass artisan. The window, which measures 4 -LCB- - by-9 feet, was found last week in a packing crate in a garage at <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> said `` The maintenance people were going to throw it out. They thought it was a crate of broken glass,'' he said. Oppenheimer said the value of the window has not been determined, but another <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> window at the church was appraised 10 years ago at $ 132,000. In 1977, Oppenheimer identified three of the church's windows as <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s and his findings were confirmed by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON> <PERSON> Parke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernet </PERSON>, the art auction house. <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> said the crate with the newly discovered window apparently was stored in the church basement in the 1960s but was moved recently to the garage. He said the window is probably one of seven commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which merged with <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in 1944. <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> records document at least three installations at <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s vouches for three others. All six windows are at <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> said the newly discovered window is apparently the seventh work commissioned from <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>. `` There are certain earmarks you look for, including the glass itself,'' he said. `` When you find all of them in one panel and it comes from a church that has a history of commissioning stained glass from <LOCATION> Tiffany </LOCATION>, you just have to take a leap of faith and pronounce it <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>.''

 <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> officials say a vacation in their state is more than OK, and they hope a road campaign in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will persuade `` snowbirds'' to stop by on their way back north this spring.

<TEXT>
 Unlike Miss Americas of recent years, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON> is not looking for movie contracts or modeling jobs after her reign ends. Instead, she is anxious to return to her job as a registered nurse at a hospital in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, working with terminally ill cancer and AIDS patients. `` After another six months of this, I'll be ready to hang up the heels and the tiara and head back to work,'' she told nurses Tuesday while visiting hospitals here. The 24-year-old former Miss <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is using her reign to maximize the image of her career, however, promoting the nursing profession rather than snipping ribbons to open new shopping malls or shaking hands at state fairs. The first months of Miss Rafko's reign, which began in September, were booked with appearances for the pageant's six sponsors, said pageant executive director <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. `` But once people saw that <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> was a nurse, we cleared her schedule to make room for more public service appearances,'' said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, in his first year as head of the pageant. `` This is what I want Miss America to do more of anyway _ less commercial appearances and more living up to the role model that she really is.'' Miss <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON> has visited numerous hospitals and hospices and spoken to many nursing associations and medical groups. She has done a public service announcement for the nursing profession and appeared on the cover of a nursing trade journal. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>'s career fits in perfectly with public service appearances, acknowledging that future Miss Americas who sing or dance for a living might not have as much expertise in dealing with service-oriented groups. `` But we're going to emphasize the fact that any Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has a beneficial interest when she speaks to any number of groups, whether it's the Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` You do n't have to be a nurse to speak to those groups and make an impression. Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can make a difference simply by promoting education.'' But this year, Miss Rafko is intent on hyping her career. `` A main focus of today's <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people is health, and fortunately I know a lot about that,'' she said. At least one other Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was inundated with special requests for speaking engagements. Miss America 1984 <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the first black Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, addressed many black organizations until she relinquished her crown in a scandal over nude photographs. But most recent Miss Americas have followed a fairly routine round of promotional appearances. `` In the past few years, many Miss Americas have concentrated on entertainment careers. There's nothing wrong with that,'' Miss <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON> said. `` Everybody has their own dreams and goals and that's what the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pageant is all about.

<TEXT>
 Saying a special investigation uncovered `` a massive network'' of corruption in city prisons, prosecutors Tuesday announced charges against seven guards and two inmates and said there would be more. District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said during a press conference outside the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that arrests could reach into the hundreds before the 18-month investigation known as `` Operation Ferret'' is completed. Officials said the investigation was prompted by widespread reports of corruption and complaints within the system. `` The investigation will potentially yield the largest number of arrests related to official misconduct by correctional officers in this country's history,'' <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said. He declined to give specifics. The city has five correctional institutions with between 8,500 and 9,000 inmates. The institutions are run by 1,700 employes, 1,400 of them are guards. The first charges stemmed from two incidents, an escape from <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> minimum security pre-release unit and an aggravated assault against a prisoner at a downtown <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION>, another pre-release facility. Those named in a grand jury presentment were charged with crimes ranging from aggravated assault to escape. In the <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> case, guard <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiest </PERSON>, prison cook <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Suder </PERSON>, and inmate <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> were charged with helping inmate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Longendorfer </PERSON> escape last July. <PERSON> Longendorfer </PERSON> was serving time for terroristic threats and indecent assault. In the other incident, which occurred Feb. 16, six correctional officers were charged with an unprovoked assault on inmate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was hospitalized for four days after the attack, <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said the beating was allegedly in retaliation for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> reporting a guard asleep at his assigned post. Those charged were officers <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sammie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Favano </PERSON> and Sgt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.

 As he stripped and cleaned the AK-47 assault rifle on his desk, Federal Judge <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON> said he has good reason to try to stop Latin American cocaine from reaching the streets of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` In 20 years, the youth that is taking all this cocaine will be running <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and influencing <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ with the mentality of cokeheads,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s influence in this region is tremendous. So we Latin Americans have to try to ensure that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youth does not take cocaine.'' The 41-year-old <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON> is the federal judge in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coastal town. He also is a weapons buff and student of military history. `` Men, like arms, are proven on the field of battle,'' he said in an interview in his cramped and cluttered office that also contained an Uzi submachine gun. `` And this is my field of battle.'' He has survived two attempts on his life, he said _ one with an incendiary bomb, the other a machine-gun attack on his home during which he returned fire with his Soviet-made AK-47. `` I love the AK,'' he said. His arsenal of weapons, he explained, is `` to defend myself against the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, named for the city in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> where it is based, is believed responsible for more than 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They have tried to bribe me with money, women, airplanes and yachts,'' he said. Leaning against the wall were five segments of hollowed out <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> redwood ostensibly intended for assembly into rustic doors. They are evidence from the biggest drug bust in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history _ the confiscation in November of four tons of cocaine by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal agents in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The drug, shipped from the northern Honduran coast, was hidden in the hollows. `` According to our information, the shipment was 8,000 kilos -LRB- almost 9 tons -RRB-. So more than half of it got through,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities were greatly concerned when, over the past few years, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> became an increasingly important transshipment point for Colombian cocaine. <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON> has been cited as a key man in joint U.S.-Honduran efforts to reduce the flow. The judge said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, with its long and relatively unguarded coast and scores of clandestine air strips, provided the ideal midpoint for northbound shipments. `` When I came here in June 1987, I found a series of cases, all of which were being dismissed for lack of evidence. ... Other judges had certain fears, some got sick, some left,'' he said. But within two months, he had handed down the first conviction and prison term for cocaine trafficking in Honduran judicial history. He has convicted 10 others on drug charges, and has nearly three dozen suspected traffickers in jail awaiting judgment. Two major traffickers based here, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> and the Cuban-American <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, were extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after being arraigned by <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON>. They are both serving terms in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisons. <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON> said he has given the maximum penalty under Honduran law to all the drug traffickers he has convicted _ five years in prison and a 5,000 lempira -LRB- $ 2,500 -RRB- fine. He complains, however, that the law is too lenient and would like to see penalties increased. He said the law provides the same penalties for cocaine trafficking as it does for marijuana trafficking. The judge _ divorced four times and the father of five children _ carries his weapons with him wherever he goes. `` If it befalls me to die in this post, then I'll die, without the slightest fear,'' he said. He keeps a .357 Magnun revolver on his desk within easy reach. The judge insists he has no political ambitions, but maintains contact with a number of the country's political leaders. `` I tell them it is imperative that we verify the origin of the parties' funds. Because if we do n't, we're running the grave risk that the traffickers get their people elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Then they reform the Constitution in their favor, they gut the anti-narcotics law; they destroy us.'' Though <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have expressed concern that drug money has corrupted some officers in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' armed forces, <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON> said the cooperation given him by the military has been `` total.'' He said his interest in the military began when he was 12 years old, with the reading of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausewitz </PERSON>, the 19th century Prussian general and writer of military strategy. `` I was two centimeters -LRB- about an inch -RRB- too short to get into the military academy,'' he said. `` But if I had, I'm sure I would have made general.''

 Rocks smashed through windows of Bus No. 60, shattering the quiet murmur of Hebrew as Jewish settlers traveled home on a moonless night. Israelis clutching frightened children in their arms ducked quickly into the aisle. Several men leaped to their feet and fired shots through two broken windows. In the darkness, the voice of a young Israeli boy rang out: `` Get the Arabs! Get them!'' `` Stop the bus!'' shouted another angry Israeli woman. The driver, an Israeli Arab, hesitated and then pulled to a stop. Three Israelis ran from the front of the bus, firing shots, and two others went out the back door. But it was too late. The Palestinian stone-throwers had disappeared into the night. In a 45-minute period Monday night, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> attackers heaved stones through windows of three buses and five cars near this <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> village on the outskirts of the settlement of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. No Arabs were caught. Three Israelis were treated for cuts at a nearby hospital, but there were no serious injuries. Jewish settlers say, however, the assaults show this biblical land is increasingly becoming a battlefield and the Arabs see them as the target. `` Make no mistake. This is war,'' said one woman aboard Bus No. 60, social worker <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 50. About 50 settlers, including a dozen children and three infants, were aboard when the bus was attacked about 9 p.m. Most of the women wore headscarves and the men wore knitted yarmulkes, the head caps of observant Jews. The red-and-white bus, marked with three Hebrew letters denoting the Eged civilian bus cooperative, was on a scheduled hour-long run from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. The trip on the winding narrow road took the settlers past several Arab villages and refugee camps, including the city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and the Dheishe refugee camp, which is blocked by a 10-foot-high wire fence to prevent stone-throwing. Settlers retaliated before dawn Tuesday, setting fire to three Arab-owned cars in <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION> and breaking the windows of several others, said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON>, president of a newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Kiryat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arba </ORGANIZATION> security committee. <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON> said a rising number of settlers who previously were inactive are being driven to fight back by the nearly nightly attacks, even if it means breaking <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law. The latest leaflet signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and distributed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> ordered Arabs to step up their fight against `` the occupation -LRB- and -RRB- its settlers.'' Arabs have not only thrown stones and firebombs at Israeli vehicles, but also defiantly hang the outlawed Palestinian banner from utility poles along roads used by settlers. The nationalist symbol acts like a red flag for many Israelis. `` They do n't have the same rights in this country as we do,'' said the London-born Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who has lived 13 years in <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION>. `` How can we let them make us cower in fear on our own buses in our own country? `` Our government is diddling and afraid to take strong action,'' she said. `` But the Arabs only understand a clear message. We should give them one.'' Some settlers already have tried to send a message, damaging Arab-owned cars, carrying out patrols along <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> roads and sometimes firing shots at Palestinians. Settlers are blamed for killing seven of the Arabs who have died during the 14-week uprising. But, <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON> warned: `` If the army does n't move to stop acts of violence against us, we are going to take far more serious steps. We are discussing setting up some kind of _ I do n't want to call them militias _ but some kind of patrols.'' The army maintains an around-the-clock presence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But fewer soldiers are in evidence now than a month ago, and the settlers complain that even when troops are on the scene, they are prevented by defense ministry policy from adequately retaliating against the Arabs. `` Many people in <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> prefer if the army does n't come, because then they can respond in their own way,'' said <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, N.Y.-born settler and also a member of the security committee. `` <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> is breaking into two groups. One is of people who are frightened, tend to ride the buses less and will eventually leave,'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. `` The other, larger group will stay and, sooner or later, take its own action to stop the violence.'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a 31-year-old doctor who specializes in trauma cases, said about four times as many vehicles traveling between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> were stoned in the first three months of this year, compared with the first three months of 1987. On Sunday, a 12-year-old girl from <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> was struck on the face by a stone as she traveled on a bus to school. Her nose was broken, her teeth chipped and her upper lip cut, said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, who treated her. `` People know it is against the law for them to act against the Arabs and they will be arrested if they do,'' he said. `` But as the violence against us increases, people are deciding they do n't have too much to lose. They are realizing coexistence with the Arabs is an impossibility.''

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> met with the Republican national chairman Tuesday to discuss his faltering presidential bid and said later he is `` laying the foundation'' for 1992. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> suffered another disappointing showing in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, collecting just 7 percent in Tuesday's primary. Though he insisted he will remain in the 1988 race, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> appeared to be looking ahead. `` I am laying the foundation now and definitely talking to people about 1992. I will play a major role in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told reporters at his headquarters in <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also talked with reporters after his meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> He said he is approaching the $ 27 million limit that candidates are allowed to spend in the primary season. He said he is laying off staff and will be forced to discontinue the big spending that has characterized his campaign so far. `` I am bumping up against the limit. ... I have enough money to keep in the race through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the convention. But I do n't have enough to do telemarketing and television,'' he said `` My own personal travel will continue but as far as a full-blown media campaign I ca n't afford that any more.'' Election law restricts spending by presidential candidates who accept federal matching funds for their campaigns. The meeting with <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> took place at <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s request, a party spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` We were discussing arrangements for the convention in August and also discussing ways where I could help Republicans gain control of key state legislatures, for instance the legislature of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, so that we could achieve redistricting of a fair basis in the early 1990s and use that as a basis to gain control of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> confirmed the meeting had focused on those two topics at the suggestion of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. She said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> expressed a wish to campaign on behalf of Republican candidates at all levels. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> `` welcomes his support,'' she said. `` As long as he can continue to bring new voters into the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, that's a positive,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also met Tuesday with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> who was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> were `` old friends.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> founded broadcasts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s stance against giving up Israeli occupied lands to the Palestinian people until after `` a period of Palestinian self rule.'' `` Any surrender of territory in the near future would seriously imperil the ability of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to defend itself,'' he said, adding that he supports negotiations among the Israelis, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinians. On politics, he was pressed to explain how he could continue campaigning without spending money. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> he spent only $ 20,000. `` I have tens of thousands of volunteers who are working ceaselessly night and day because they care for a cause, they care for principle,'' he said. `` Its a movement to bring about conservative principles in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 A viewer never knows exactly what to expect from the <ORGANIZATION> Lar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lubovitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> but it's almost certain to be interesting. Tuesday's opening night of a two-week season presented two very different premieres and a masterpiece from 1986, `` Concerto Six Twenty-Two.'' The opening, which attracted a formal-dress audience to the City Center, marks the 20th anniversary of <PERSON> Lubovitch </PERSON>'s founding his own modern dance company to dance his choreography. `` Musette,'' the premiere ending the evening, is set to Poulenc's `` Concerto for Two Pianos.'' <PERSON> Lubovitch </PERSON> has six couples follow the music's moods, which often change. He does n't repeat himself. Early in the dance, though in bare feet, the dancers assume the leg and foot positions of ballet. <PERSON> Lubovitch </PERSON> has, as he usually does, a time for humor. One man's solo ends, to his apparent surprise, when two men pick him up and carry him off stage. At one time, half the dancers stand still, while the rest dance in and out among them like skiers going around poles. When the music becomes lyrical, the men lift and carry the women so their colorful tulle skirts look like big candy canes going by. There is a section that looks like court dancing and one that looks like trained dancers' variations of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s folk version of court dancing, the reel. A romantic section of music has two men picking up one woman between them and gracefully swinging her. `` Musette'' ends most satisfactorily with a courtly bow. `` Of My Soul,'' to a Bach `` Cantata,'' was danced at Avery Fisher Hall last summer at the Mostly Mozart Festival. The company considers this the `` official'' premiere. <PERSON> Lubovitch </PERSON> incorporated some American sign language into the arm movements. It's an arresting idea which does n't come off brilliantly. Some of the arm movements translate what four people are singing in the orchestra pit. <PERSON> Lubovitch </PERSON> has made them flow in and out of expansive arm reaches. That works but the whole thing does n't seem to arise from the music like the evening's other two dances. `` Concerto Six Twenty-Two,'' premiered at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, is danced to <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra.'' The dancers, wearing white, in the first and third movements, looked inspired and fresh. The middle movement, danced by <PERSON> Sylvain </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafortune </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Michalek </PERSON>, remains one of dance's most moving and dignified duets. In such simple things as one man leaning back against the other's hand, it shows human support and trust. The <ORGANIZATION> Solisti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, conducted by <PERSON> Ransom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, did a beautiful job with the <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> music. The Poulenc music was a recording.

<HEAD>NASA Panel Says It Can Show CFC Effects On Ozone</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says the ozone shield is in fact thinning measurably due to chlorofluorocarbon compounds. A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> panel said the shield thinned out by about 2.3 percent over a 17-year period ending in 1986 in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. The panel said the shield thinned by 0.5 percent to 1.8 percent over nine years ending in 1987 in the tropics and part of the temperate zones of both hemispheres. This means increased skin cancer around the world, largely unknown effects on fish and wildlife and increased pressure from environmentalists to go beyond the treaty approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to cut emissions of ozone-destroying chemicals. Chlorofluorocarbons are used as refrigeration fluids, cleaning solvents and plastic foam blowing agents. `` At this point there is no other culprit to blame,'' panel member <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> said Tuesday. `` We have taken out all the natural phenomena that are believed to affect ozone.'' A massive 17-month effort by more than 100 scientists convened by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> went through practically every ozone observation made in recent years, trying to correct for instrument errors and drift and to remove the effects of the 11-year solar cycle and the biennial oscillation of high-altitude winds. Since 1985, there have been several reports of ozone decline worldwide in addition to the well-established ozone `` hole'' over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> _ a 50 percent decline in springtime, followed by recovery. <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the report `` will certainly be a part of the 1990 assessment'' called for in the treaty. `` The crucial first step, however, is speedy international ratification,'' he said. But Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., said, `` The nations of the world should immediately reconvene to consider amendments'' to the treaty, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should resume its advocacy of a complete ban `` We've got to make deeper cuts in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> emissions,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, executive director of the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, a group of producers and users, said the 1990 schedule `` is the framework to be followed'' because unilateral reductions wo n't help. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 83-0 on Monday to approve a 31-nation treaty calling for 50 percent cuts by 1998 in production of chlorofluorocarbons. Noting that <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> now were released at ground level about 10 years ago and that the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> hole could last 100 years even if the treaty is followed, <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said, `` There's plenty of reason to re-open the ... protocol.'' Ozone at high altitudes makes life on earth possible by blocking the harmful ultraviolet rays. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that each percent decrease in ozone means a 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in non-melanoma skin cancer and a 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent increase in the more deadly melanoma form. Considering the incidence and death rates of both forms, this would mean 280 to 455 deaths per year on top of the 10,000 from skin cancer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or 640 to 1,050 deaths if a 2.3 percent decline were uniform across the country. The 2.3 percent is not uniform. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> presented its 1969-1986 Northern Hemisphere estimates from ground obserations as averages over each of three bands: 30 degrees latitude -LRB- about the latitude of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> -RRB- to 40 degrees -LRB- <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> -RRB-, down 1.7 percent; 40 degrees to 53 degrees -LRB- <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> -RRB-, down 3.0 percent; and 53 degrees to 64 degrees -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fairbanks </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> -RRB-, down 2.3 percent. No single estimate was presented for all three bands, but <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said the average, a 2.3 percent decline, would be close. All the estimates have substantial uncertainty about them. Each of the three band estimates has a 68 percent chance of being plus or minus 1.0 percentage point, at most, away from the number given. Corrected satellite data show an ozone decline of about 2.5 percent in the band running from 53 degrees north to 53 degrees south from 1978 through 1987. But 0.7 percent to 2.0 percent of this results from the solar cycle, the report said.

<HEAD>U.S. Government Agency Would Buy Shares In Business Abroad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two years ago the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposed selling its <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to private interests. Now it's urging that the government agency be allowed to buy shares in private companies. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s president for more than seven years, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on economic policy on Tuesday that the agency wants to begin a pilot project that would put $ 10 million over the next five years into black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The money would be spent to take up as much as 30 percent of the shares in new American companies there. Government bodies in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> already help their private investors in this way. <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s main job is to sell insurance to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> investors overseas, against what are called political risks: war, rebellion, civil strife, confiscation and official freezing of assets. It is one of the few federal agencies that makes money: $ 300 million over the past three years, <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s strong financial position makes the agency a good candidate for privatization,'' said the president's budget proposal for the year that ended last September. There was considerable opposition to the idea, both inside and outside the agency, on grounds the insurance was sought precisely because it had the power of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government behind it. After some study, the president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> decided that <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> had better stay part of the government. The privatization plan was quietly dropped. <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> also makes loans to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies setting up business in other countries _ $ 202.8 million worth of loans and guarantees last year. <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> said Tuesday that buying shares as well as making loans would help small projects get started. It would allow these heavily indebted countries to borrow less for industrial development, he said. Many are unable to borrow because banks have cut back their lending he said. <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> also argued that direct investment by his agency would help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s major ... counterparts all have the ability to invest equity, thus providing their clients with a significant advantage over their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitors,'' he said in his prepared testimony.

He said he wants the students to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on the project, although the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has not yet embraced the idea. The students' interest was piqued by what they learned while representing low-income taxpayers in audits, collections and other actions involving the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. They learned that on the average, only 11 percent of taxpayers with less than a high school education have the reading skills to comprehend instructions for filling out Forms 1040 or 1040EZ. The students concluded that if taxpayers ca n't understand how to comply with the tax laws, they probably wo n't. Or as <PERSON> Creme </PERSON>, a tax lawyer for 20 years, put it, `` When people ca n't figure out the right answer, they will take the answer that gives them the best break.'' High school dropouts are n't the only people having trouble with this year's tax forms. Even tax professionals shake their heads at some instructions prompted by the more complex provisions of the 1986 tax overhaul, which was initially billed as tax `` simplification.'' This sentence is part of the Form 1040 instructions for determining how much interest is deductible: `` If all of your mortgage debt on your principal home was borrowed before August 17, 1986, -LRB- and you have not borrowed any new amounts on that debt -RRB-; OR, at all times in 1987, the total of your mortgage debts was less than or equal to what you paid for the home plus improvements -LRB- such as adding a room -RRB-, the mortgage interest you paid is fully deductible on line 9a or 9b, whichever applies.'' <PERSON> Creme </PERSON> says that about 20 students training in law, business or education will develop a more-readable W-4 withholding form; W-2 yearend wages-earned statement; 1099 interest-earned form and the basic 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ forms. `` We're not saying we could bring it down to a second-grade level, but we certainly can make it simpler,'' he said. `` If you simplify the forms, people will be a lot less hostile toward the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. And you'll raise a lot more revenue.'' Creme and some of the students volunteered for the project Monday while testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee about <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> penalties. The chairman, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., welcomed the idea Creme and Professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, director of the university's <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said it is not difficult to figure out why the tax forms and instructions are difficult. `` The average sentence length of these publications exceeds 25 words,'' they said in written testimony. `` One-third of the words in these publications are multisyllabled words.'' Creme's solution: `` By reducing the number of syllables and the number of words in a sentence we can make the forms and instructions significantly more readable. And we want to change how the forms look _ change the spacing so things do n't look so crammed in.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> forms are developed in consultation with lawyers, accountants and educators. In changing its forms last year to reflect the new tax law, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> hired a consultant and even went to some shopping malls for instant reaction from random taxpayers. As for the students' project, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrek </PERSON> says, `` One-syllable words are nice, but what do you do about ` dependents'?'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimates nearly half of taxpayers will pay professionals to fill out their returns this year.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of a bill requiring the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about all covert actions within 48 hours after the operations start marks a major step toward avoiding another Iran-Contra affair, say the measure's sponsors. `` This will help immeasurably toward preventing the kind of mistakes that were made'' in the Iran-Contra affair, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said late Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 71-19 in favor of the bill The measure now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where `` overwhelming approval'' is likely, according to both <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is considering a similar bill, but no date has been set for a vote by the panel or for floor action. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has threatened to veto the legislation as an unconstitutional restriction on his ability to conduct foreign policy. But <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said, `` That kind of threat has been heard before and it has n't come true.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> noted that the 71 votes are four more than the two-thirds which would be required to override any presidential veto. `` And that 71 total is without some of our supporters here,'' he said. The bill arises from the Iran-Contra affair, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons were secretly sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and some of the profits were diverted to the Contra guerrillas in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> withheld notification about the arms sales from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for 10 months. Current laws require only that the White House give Congess `` timely notice'' about covert actions, but they do not define the term. The Intelligence Committees had been operating on the assumption that the phrase meant only a brief delay in notification. `` This bill clarifies what we thought was the procedure all along,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` We believed timely meant a couple of days and we were surprised to find out that the administration was working under a different definition.'' The measure does n't give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a veto over covert operations, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> noted. `` There's no piece of legislation that can weave a web of security around good or bad judgment,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` I ca n't say for sure this would have prevented Iran-Contra, but it would mean that we can give the president the benefit of our advice. The function we serve is to have a second opinion outside the administration.'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said if the bill eventually becomes law, `` it will help'' prevent future problems because `` it clears up so many ambiguities that are in the existing law. It makes the notification process so much more clear.'' But he warned that `` you can never prevent absolutely any future Iran-Contras, anymore than a law against bank robberies will prevent bank robberies.'' In the wake of the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> noted, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has promised to tell <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> about all future covert actions and has moved administratively to make many of the changes proposed in the law. `` This only writes into law what the president has already said he would do,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The bill also requires written `` findings,'' which are the presidential orders authorizing covert operations. Some actions in the Iran-Contra affair were done under an oral finding which was open to misinterpretation, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. Before passing the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected, 60-32, a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, to allow notification within 10 days, instead of two days. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said the time period was long enough to permit actions, such as the rescue of hostages, in which lives might be endangered by leaks of information, but short enough to discover situations such as the Iranian arms sale. Earlier, the chamber voted 73-18 to limit debate. That was 13 more votes than needed to invoke cloture and block an attempt by conservative Republicans to pass the measure. One opponent, Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said: `` This bill is badly drafted, badly conceived, and the worst of its conceptions is that somehow you can legislate intelligence ... it's hard for me to believe that one piece of legislation can obviate stupid activity. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> testified last week that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believed the bill was an unconstitutional restriction on presidential authority and would veto it. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> took over as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> easily fielded one complicated economic question after another from a congressional committee, but then one request stopped him cold. Who was on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> committee that charts national monetary policy when it held its most recent meeting last month? That question, posed on Tuesday by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, stumped <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and the six aides seated behind him, at least temporarily At issue was a Feb. 9-10 meeting of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, or <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION>. It is made up of the seven members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and five regional <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bank presidents. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, shuffling papers and conferring with his aides, made a halting effort to name the five <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bank presidents on the panel in February _ and finally got four of the five right. `` You're a little bit fuzzy on just who voted in February,'' <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> said. `` I'm not fuzzy on who voted. I know who was on the committee. What I do n't remember is which ones of them were on at that particular time,'' said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> business consultant who took command of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last August. The committee meets every few months to chart the nation's monetary policy <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> contends that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> committee is unconstitutional because it holds vast power over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic policy even though five of its members are not appointed by the president nor do they undergo <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. So far, federal courts have not agreed with <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>'s assertion. At that February meeting, the committee voted to widen the target range for the growth of the nation's money supply in 1988 _ an action that could bear on inflation and interest rates. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the committee he was confused because committee membership is rotated among the presidents of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> banks _ and `` we're in the process now of changing.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, said the rotation of members onto the committee took place on March 1 _ after the last meeting. For the record, the five bank president members of the committee in February were <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, a non-rotating position; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Keehn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The one <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> missed? <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. Instead, he named <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melzer </PERSON>, not a voting member of the committee then or now.

<HEAD>Kennedy, Administration Offer Similar Tax Break Bills For College
Savings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and Democrats led by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> agree that tax breaks must be provided to encourage parents to save early for college tuition costs that continue to skyrocket. `` Rising costs threaten to put a college degree out of reach of average families'' as well as the poor, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` We must find a safe, convenient and simple way to help them meet tuition bills.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat has drafted a plan that would encourage tuition savings by making interest on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Savings Bonds tax free if the bonds are used for college tuition. Families earning under $ 75,000 a year would receive the full benefit of the legislation. The tax break would be reduced for families earning more, decreasing until it is completely phased out at the $ 150,000 income level. `` There is an excellent chance that many families who are not saving now will do so, using this safe, convenient plan,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> proposal is similar to the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill, providing tax exemptions on interest for parents who save for college. But the eligibility is lower under the president's plan, which calls for a phasing out of the tax break for families earning between $ 60,000 and $ 80,000. The administration's proposal also would allow tax-free interest on savings bonds used to cover part of a student's living expenses in addition to tuition, books and other fees. <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> said the administration version eventually would cost about $ 1 billion in lost revenues, but said the incentives are `` urgently needed'' as college tuition continues to skyrocket. `` We're coming perilously close to a time when only the wealthy can attend the university of their choice,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., who is backing the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said his measure, also supported by Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, is expected to cost about $ 300 million five years into the program. But he said because the government saves $ 60 million for every $ 1 billion sold in savings bonds, the plan eventually could be self-financing. <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> warned that by the year 2007, the total cost of attending a four-year private university will be $ 200,000. Today, it is more than $ 50,000, nearly doubling since 1980, he said. Federal grants and loans, meanwhile, have stayed about the same. `` If we're going to continue to compete, we have to have a competitive education,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who is supporting the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill. <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> said the administration opposes legislation that would restore the interest payment deduction on college loans. In a related matter, officials from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> complained about a proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to tax <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s guaranteed college tuition trust <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> have adopted guaranteed tuition programs similar to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> trust allows payment into a state fund in return for guaranteed tuition. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ruled that people buying trust contracts on behalf of children would have no additional tax liability, but that the trust itself is subject to federal taxes, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said Tuesday at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. Federal taxes could add up to 20 percent to the cost of a trust contract, if the trust were to invest fully in taxable bonds, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Johnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> declined to comment on its ruling, or even to acknowledge a ruling had been made. `` We do not feel that it should be taxed,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> treasury division. `` We are basically setting up a trust where these are going to be state dollars, and at no time will the purchaser of a contract have any control of the monies once they are paid.''

 The faces stare at you in unrelenting succession, none with a smile. They are faces of adults without hope and children without childhood. There is photograph after photograph of families being evicted, mother and children sitting outdoors on their piled-up belongings. They are pictures that have the impact of war, of the Great Depression, of children orphaned and victimized by fighting not of their making. These are the scenes in a new exhibit called `` Homeless in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' that opened Tuesday at the Corcoran Gallery, a block from the White House. The exhibit of 64 pictures will tour 32 cities in the coming years to act as, in the words of its sponsors, `` a centerpiece for public education.'' `` It's a national disgrace that in this country of plenty there are people who do n't have a place to live,,'' said <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Elson </PERSON>, immediate past president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which joined in producing the exhibit along with Families for the Homeless, a group that includes congressional, administration and media families. <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, wife of the senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, headed the project. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we have become adjusted to the image of poverty,'' she said. `` The half-clothed child in a shack in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> is what many people still think of when they think about poor people in this country,'' she said before the exhibit opened. `` Today's realities far outstrip this outdated image and that is why we felt it was important to have top photojournalists communicate through the power of their images. Simultaneously with the opening of the exhibit, a book of the photographs was published. Many of the photographers represented in the exhibit and book were commissioned by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, formerly President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal photographer. `` The exhibit will endure as a lasting work of art and that, too, is important,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` But the key component, the key element is using the photographs to ... drive home that there are maybe three million homeless people in this country, that they are families, that they are children, the elderly, that they are veterans, that they are mentally ill, that they are the most vulnerable people in our society and that they are growing.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the project cost $ 450,000. Its principal funding was provided by <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The photographs, all black and white, depict such urban scenes as a pair of legs sticking from a box that obviously served as a night's accommodations; a child eating from a metal bowl in her home, under an underpass; a small girl weeping as a humane society worker removes her cat in a cage, prior to her own eviction; families with their belongings in plastic bags. They show two young men scavenging through a metal trash container; a man and woman asleep on a park bench, his knee serving as her pillow; a food line, with the splendor of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> skyline as a backdrop. The honorary patron of the project is <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wife of the vice president. The board of directors includes <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, wife of White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Total Wheat Exports To Reach 1.55 Billion In Year Ending May 31</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Subsidized sales are expected to account for more than 60 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat exports this year, according to projections by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Total wheat exports are forecast at a six-year high of 1.55 billion bushels in the marketing year that runs through May 31, up 54 percent from 1986-87. Sales of subsidized wheat under the Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, have climbed rapidly this year, particularly since last October, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Big sales have been made to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the two largest wheat importers, as well as to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the agency said in a new outlook report. The program was started three years ago in selected overseas markets to counter subsidized exports by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competiors, notably the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, exporters get free government-owned surplus commodities as bonuses, or subsidies, so they can sell wheat _ or other eligible products _ to designated foreign countries. Since June 1, 1985, according to the report, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has announced `` initiatives'' or offers to sell wheat to 30 countries for a total of 43.1 million metric tons. Through Feb. 11, the actual sales totaled 31.4 million tons, most of it since last fall. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The projected export total this marketing year of 1.55 billion bushels would be about 42 million tons, of which more than 25 million tons is expected to be shipped under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>. The brisk sales have boosted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat export prices, the report said. The average price at Gulf ports loaded aboard ship for hard red winter wheat of ordinary protein rose to about $ 130 per ton in January from $ 116 in November and $ 110 in January 1987. Rising prices also meant that the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies increased. Those averaged about $ 34 per ton during the 1986-87 marketing year but rose in November and December before easing off in January, the report said. For example, the subsidy for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> rose to more than $ 40 per ton but later dropped to less than $ 30. `` The total value of wheat bonuses awarded from the first wheat offer through January 1988 is approximately $ 1.1 billion,'' the report said. `` Nearly 40 percent of the total has been awarded since Oct. 1, 1987.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies and the rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat exports has had an impact on world trade, the report showed. In the current 1987-88 marketing year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produced about 11 percent of the world output of wheat, the same as in 1986-87. But the boom in exports _ to 1.55 billion bushels from 1 billion bushels the previous year _ is giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> an estimated 41 percent of the world's wheat exports, compared with only 30 percent in 1986-87. According to agency records, that puts the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export share at its highest level since 1982-83 when it was 42 percent.

 Fat-conscious consumers soon may be able to buy leaner hot dogs, bologna and other cooked sausages. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has approved a rule change that will let processors make make leaner products by substituting water for fat, so long as there is no loss of nutritional value. The leaner products can be labeled as `` lite,'' `` light,'' or `` lower fat'' if they contain at least a fourth less fat than similar cooked sausage products on the market, officials said. The labels must include a comparison that explains the term. For example, the label for lower-fat hotdogs might say: `` This product contains 20 percent fat, while <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> allows 30 percent fat in meat hot dogs.'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the change in regulations will be effective on April 14 and `` reflects our desire to facilitate the marketing of lower-fat products.'' Current federal rules for cooked sausages limit fat to 30 percent and `` added'' water to 10 percent. The new rule will limit the combination of fat and added water to 40 percent of the product. The maximum fat content in the finished product will continue to be limited to 30 percent, but the water restriction will be removed so that processors can substitute some of the water for fat _ and wind up with a lower-fat product, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Protein content, which is indirectly controlled by the limits on fat and added water, will remain unchanged and will be comparable to other cooked sausages, he said. The rule change is being made at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private trade association, which asked <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to develop a standard for light frankfurthers and similar cooked sausages. The proposed change was announced by the agency on Nov. 25, 1986.

<HEAD>11-Ton Satellite to be Retrieved by Shuttle Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 11-ton satellite in orbit three years longer than planned will be rescued by a space shuttle crew next year, just months before it would fall back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in pieces. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday included the retrieval of the satellite _ the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> _ in a new schedule of flights and cargoes. The rescue was added to a mission beginning July 13. The orbit of the satellite, which gauged the effects of space's hostile environment on metal coatings and on 13 million seeds, is decaying and officials fear it will crash through the atmosphere and break up if it is not recaptured by mid-1990 The new schedule makes no change in the date of the much-delayed first post-Challenger flight, now set for Aug. 4. There have been no American manned missions in space since the Challenger _ the 25th shuttle mission _ exploded on liftoff Jan. 28, 1986 and killed its seven-member crew. The six-sided Long Duration Exposure Facility _ <ORGANIZATION> LDEF </ORGANIZATION> in space jargon _ was tossed overboard by astronauts in April 1984 to be hit by meteors, pelted by cosmic rays and corroded by oxygen atoms. The bus-size frame held 57 experiments, including one that tested 120 varieties of vegetables, fruits and flowers to see whether cosmic radiation caused useful genetic changes. The <ORGANIZATION> LDEF </ORGANIZATION> was to have been retrieved by another shuttle mission 10 months later and brought back in the cargo bay. But delays in the space program combined with grounding of all shuttles after the Challenger disaster kept the 11-ton satellite in its lonely journey around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The $ 14 million package has no on-board propulsion systems or ability to transmit signals. It is orbiting 292 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> schedule also calls for six small and medium-sized expendable rockets to be launched this year, four in 1989 and seven in 1990. The shuttle schedule reverses the order of one military and one civilian flight early next year. This enables <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to orbit a pair of huge communications satellites earlier than planned. They will be needed in June 1989 when the $ 1 billion <ORGANIZATION> Hubble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> is launched from a shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> places such emphasis on the two communications satellites that they will be the principal cargoes on the first and third flights in the new series. Together they will provide communications with the shuttle 95 percent of the time it is in orbit and be a spaceborne switchboard for many satellites. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was forced to change its priorities for shuttle payloads in order to be ready to launch the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe to map <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> at a time when the least amount of fuel will be needed to traverse the 90 million miles. The <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> flight is scheduled for April 27 and it will be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary mission since a Pioneer probe was launched to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in 1978. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope for June 1, 1989, and another important planetary flight _ <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> _ for Oct. 8, 1989. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is a cooperative project with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to survey Jupiter and its moons. The first shuttle flight will have a five-man crew commanded by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. The next mission, scheduled on the Atlantis for Oct. 27, will launch two military communications satellites. The next flight, Discovery again, will be on Jan. 19, 1989 and the fourth, using <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, will be March 2 _ a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission to launch an advanced reconnaissance satellite. A Spacelab mission _ so-called because a complete laboratory is carried in the shuttle's cargo bay _ was delayed in the new schedule to push the <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION> satellite ahead. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the mission to study the universe in the ultraviolet spectrum is being reconfigured to enhance study of the brightest exploding star seen by astronomers in more than 200 years. The discovery of Supernova 1987A has drawn attention of astrophysicists around the world. The new schedule also adds two Spacelab flights in 1990, using the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> has been moved forward in the schedule to March 1990. The Ulysses mission to study the sun and its environment remains in an October 1990 launch date.

<HEAD>Senate Clears Measure To Set Cap On Legal Immigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of a bill to change the nation's legal immigration system say they'll begin negotiations with key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, and push for final passage this year. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 88-4 vote Tuesday for the legislation, there is no indication that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is ready to tackle the bil 16 months after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted a landmark law to curb illegal immigration. The current immigration control bill took six years to pass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as large numbers of special interest groups prevented a consensus until the fall of 1986. In contrast, the new legislation was guided through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with a minimum of debate by Democrat <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and Republican <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. They had smoothed the way by holding extensive discussions with their colleagues. The bill deals with those who apply through normal government channels to come here _ not with illegal immigrants. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure would establish a cap on legal immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It would maintain the current priority for applicants with relatives in this country, but vastly expand immigration visas for those with needed labor and professional skills. The most influential House member on immigration matters, <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, has said he wants to move slowly until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a better idea of how the 1986 law is working. That means no immediate action, but does not rule out approval of the legislation later this year. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said they plan to initiate discussions with <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> soon. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said the senator thinks <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders `` can see the need to reform the -LRB- legal immigation -RRB- system.'' Others expected to be part of the consultations include Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the Judiciary panel's immigration subcommittee; Rep. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the subcommittee; and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has introduced a measure similar to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure is expected to allow more Western Europeans into the country by expanding the number of visas for those without family members here. Sponsors say the family preference system has resulted in 85 percent of the immigrants to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> coming from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Ninety percent of the people immigrating to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> arrive under the family system. The remaining 10 percent come in under other categories including job and professional skills. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> has expressed worry that any new bill would interfere with family reunification. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said that would not happen, because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s cap is 100,000 above the currrent figures. The maximum number of visas under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would be 590,000 annually. Under this umbrella, 470,000 visas in each of the first three years -LRB- 440,000 thereafter -RRB- would be reserved for family immigration, and 120,000 -LRB- 150,000 after three years -RRB- would be for the new `` independent'' category. Currently, spouses and minor children of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens can enter the country without limitation. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s bill would have a more generous cap of 750,000, including refugees fleeing from persecution. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> cap does not include refugees, who now are admitted under a separte law that sets annual limits. The current refugee cap is 68,500. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> has said there may be attempts in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to link a legal immigration bill with proposals to extend an amnesty program for some of those who came here illegally. The 1986 law grants legalization to those who have lived in this country since before Jan. 1, 1982, but the program ends May 4. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> opposes an extension, and conservative senators would be expected to filibuster if an extension were added to a legal immigration bill, according to <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> staffers. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> has favored an extension, but has not said whether he desires linking the issues. Voting against the bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were Democrat <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, and three Republicans: <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Officials Say NRC Statements May Imperil Prosecution Of Spill Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal prosecutors fear that statements by <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> officials may have jeopardized their investigation of a 1986 radioactive spill at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> military base, according to agency documents. The Democratic staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> released documents Tuesday that include a memo from an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official who said other <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> representatives believed regulations governing the incident were ambiguous and open to interpretation. The memo also said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the southern district of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, believed those statements may have `` significantly impacted'' on the chances for a successful prosecution of officials involved in the spill. The case involves a Sept. 18, 1986, spill of highly radioactive Americium-241 at <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The spill occurred when workers opened an unlabeled drum at a base storage facility. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials have said almost no radiation escaped from the building despite a second spill Oct. 6 while a cleanup was under way. The building eventually had to be torn down at a cost of $ 1 million. An inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s Region III office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> determined that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to report the incident promptly violated an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> regulation requiring disclosure within 24 hours of any incident that threatens to shut down operations of a facility for one day or more or causes over $ 2,000 in property damage. The documents released by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee included a January memo from <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawlik </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s Region III investigations field office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pawlik </PERSON>'s memo refers to a December 1987 meeting between two <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials at the agency's Region IV office in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawlik </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, nuclear materials safety section chief for the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, radiation specialist. According to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> memo, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> regulations governing disclosure were ambiguous and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> had not communicated to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> a full interpretation of how the regulations were to be implemented. And <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> stated that the first spill was open to interpretation and not reportable and that in his mind the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was not negligible in waiting to file a report. `` I think it is a fair assessment to say that the two recent interviews of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> have at this late date placed most, if not all, of the ... investigation in jeopardy,'' <PERSON> Pawlik </PERSON> said in the memo. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> declined comment on the documents Tuesday through a spokesman. Americium powder is not considered dangerous on the skin, but small amounts can cause cancer if inhaled or otherwise introduced into the body.

<HEAD>Baptist Minister Fired For Saying Jews Don't Need Jesus To be
Saved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNION, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Southern Baptist minister says he was fired from his denomination's regional mission board because he believes Jews can achieve salvation without converting to Christianity. The Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here was regional director of interfaith witness for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for 12 years. The region runs from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and west to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. As director of the interfaith witness, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> was the Southern Baptist liaison with other religious groups, including Jews. A statement from the mission board's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters said <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> `` was not fired or terminated'' but `` declined transfer'' from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to a position as an editorial assistant at the headquarters. But <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, 45, said Tuesday he was fired, and has hired an attorney to counter any claims by the mission board that he resigned. The minister believes he was fired because he opposed <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin a program aimed at converting Jews. The program was discussed at a private meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said he was asked in June to submit to the board a written statement about his theological views about Jews. `` In the absence of any Biblical contradiction, I believe that the Jews of today, as ever, receive salvation through their having been chosen by God in covenant with <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> and the prophets,'' <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> wrote in his statement. He said board members grilled him about his views when he was summoned to a special meeting in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in November. The board informed him in a letter dated Jan. 9 that he was being assigned, he said. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said he has not been able to determine if the board considered his views heretical, and added that the board had not given him a specific reason for removing him from his post. In 1987, the national convention of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> accepted the view that Jews can achieve salvation without believing in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. Opposition to attempts to convert Jews often is based on this view.

<HEAD>Farm Lawmakers Flirt With Big New Trade Subsidy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers may make a massive new farm subsidy program part of sweeping trade legislation, while its chief backer argues that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiators want it despite the threat of a presidential veto. The subsidy plan known as a `` triggered marketing loan'' was included in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the 1,000-page trade bill. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are working on a compromise. Final action on the loan program was postponed when <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., had the votes but wanted a few revisions Under marketing loan programs, some of which already are in effect, producers receive the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price for their crops, which are then sold at world market prices. The taxpayers make up the difference. The plan under consideration would create such provisions for wheat, corn and soybeans but only if current negotiations failed to produce an agreement among the nation's trading partners to reduce agricultural subsidies by the 1990 wheat marketing year. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said he was convinced of the need for a triggered marketing loan on a trip to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week to get a progress report on negotiations aimed at reaching a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said European negotiators have been `` arrogant'' in their rejection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for an end to export subsidies. He said Americans at the table in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> favor the triggered marketing loan as a `` club'' to hold over the Europeans and prod them on the issue. `` If you were talking to some of the people we have to negotiate with, then you might think we need it, too,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. In other action, the panel approved expanding the 1985 Export Enhancement Program by more than $ 1 billion to $ 2.5 billion. It provides bonuses in the form of government-held commodities to exporters to ship American commodities that they acquired at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices. Critics of the triggered marketing loan program said that the sum involved could strain the budget. `` This is potentially a huge sum of money we're talking about in agricultural programs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., whose home-state growers are often wary of anything that could prompt restrictions abroad against orange and grapefruit exports Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the use of such a measure as a bargaining chip would not be credible now because it would require reshuffling budget priorities. <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> did say he favored the objective. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should tell the European Community: `` If they have unlimited supplies of money, it's going to cost all of it and we're going to raise you five.'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> presented a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and other administration officials suggesting that attaching the program could prompt a presidential veto for the trade bill.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> set aside his disappointment in finishing second in his home state primary Tuesday night and focused on his overall strength, saying `` I am where every candidate wishes he could be tonight.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had predicted he would finish first in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and defeat another favorite son, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. But the results showed just the opposite. `` I finished second, it seems, in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I'm a winner. I am the leading contender for the Democratic nomination. I am where every candidate wishes he could be tonight.'' A noticeably tired <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told supporters at a downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hotel that both he and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had reason to celebrate. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters, he said, `` paid their respects on a sitting senator who focused on one state.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> voted near his <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> home earlier in the day, accompanied by sons <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, 22, at the <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic candidate said his message to `` stop drugs from coming into our country, save our jobs, secure our farmers and invest in our children'' has touched voters and given them something to fight for. `` I have run all the way, and we've been winning all the way, and we'll keep winning,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had hoped to add <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to a string of successes over the last week, beginning with Super Tuesday and continuing over the weekend in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. He and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> top the delegate count. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> voted shortly after 9 a.m. in a small church room jammed with reporters, photographers and a handful of bewildered-looking voters. Afterward, donning a topcoat on a chilly day, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was touched by `` the joy I see in my children voting. When I was their age, I did not have the right to vote.'' `` It says a lot about the greatness of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the fact that we have the right to grow to our potential,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Hope is going to prevail.'' The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native said he has been the most effective and best managed candidate, despite relatively weak financing. `` If my opponents had my budget, they could not compete,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` If I had their budgets, they could not compete.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose delegate total was second only to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' going into Tuesday's primary, said he has broadened his base of support since waging his first presidential campaign four years ago. `` Expectations are higher; the experience factor is greater and I've had a chance to serve more people,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` People who feel that the process was not working for them find hope in the campaign. ... Now they feel there is a way out. There is hope.''

 Students who skip Professor <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' opening lecture in his course on group decision-making may find themselves searching the campus in vain for any trace of him the rest of the semester. That's because the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor communicates with his <ORGANIZATION> Speech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> 350 class only through the school's computer system, by electronic mail or `` E-mail. The class does get weekly lectures, from two graduate students, and other graduate students sit in on group discussions as `` consultants.'' `` We've got a real industrial model,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, who this semester has 212 students enrolled in the course. `` What we've got here is a simulation of top management, middle management and employees.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> considers himself the chief executive officer. As such, he monitors computer messages between student groups and the graduate students, and answers questions sent to him. `` I can monitor everything. They know I'm monitoring. I'm the CEO. I can get all the information on my company,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 59, does n't go to his office on campus often. He prefers to stay home, a mile away, working from his cramped study filled with computer equipment. Graduate students who have been there have dubbed his study `` the bridge of the <ORGANIZATION> Starship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>,'' after the spaceship on the television series `` Star Trek.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he is giving students a taste of the real world, adding that he is more accessible than most professors. Last spring, in a trial run of the course, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he answered 3,169 questions from students. `` You find me a professor anywhere in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that can handle 3,169 questions _ and they were n't stupid questions,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. Students who miss <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' lecture on the first day of class can only guess at the appearance of the professor known by his computer address `` gmp.'' `` One says she's going to track me down to see what I look like and talk to me face to face. I said ` Catch me if you can,''' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. One student who asked that her name not be used said the course puts too much emphasis on computer communication. `` It's like E-Mail is God,'' she said. `` It really should n't be like that. There has to be some communication that is one-on-one.'' Others disagree. `` I do n't think we've suffered any because we have n't seen him face to face,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON>, a senior operations management major from <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` He's readily available on the computer.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has a contract to write a book on the course, which he said has generated widespread interest. `` We've been visited by educators from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A lot of people are looking over our shoulder in this process,'' he said. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' emphasis on mimicking a corporate hierarchy hinders the students' understanding of how they come to their decisions. `` Here our goals are understanding the group process, not just decision making,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s graduate program in organizational psychology `` The most important aspect of group processes is non-verbal behavior.''

 Former Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s bid for a political comeback ended in defeat Tuesday, but House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s point man in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, easily overcame his first <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary challenge in 32 years. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s Democratic arch-foe, attorney <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, won the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, setting the stage for a November rematch of the 1982 contest that almost cost <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> his 18th District seat. With nearly three-quarters of the votes counted, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> defeated <ORGANIZATION> Tazewell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsicker </PERSON> by 85 percent to 15 percent, while <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> beat an unemployed recent college graduate, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Z </PERSON>. West, 89 percent to 11 percent. The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> said between 45 percent and 48 percent of the state's 5.9 million registered voters went to the polls. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Aurelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> in a race for the Democratic nomination for clerk of the circuit court. With nearly three-quarters of the vote reported, Mrs. <PERSON> Puchinski </PERSON> had 53 percent of the Democratic primary vote. `` It means that when the people spoke, they apparently shouted. ... I am very good at taking hints,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. Asked whether she would consider running for office again, she said, `` I'm not even thinking of it right now.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> powerbroker who left the party, was unopposed on the Republican side and will face Mrs. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> in November. Also back on <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> ballots were followers of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. At least 20 LaRouche supporters were candidates in races ranging from president to county register of deeds. In Southern Illinois, the retirement of veteran Rep. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, a Democrat, set off a four-man scramble in the 21st District primary. Vying for the party's nomination were <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Auditor Pete Fields; former Price administrative aide <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> and perennial local candidate <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Maragides </PERSON>. In the 22nd District, state Sen. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Poshard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carterville </LOCATION> was unopposed in the Democratic primary as he moved to succeed Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who is retiring after 12 terms. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Prineas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> sought the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> voters held a non-binding referendum on the training of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. With roughly three-quarters of the precincts reporting, those wanted to stop sending <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> outnumbered those favoring the foreign-training program about 2-to-1. Neighbors of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> also opposed night games at the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>' vintage ballpark, piling up 3-to-1 margin in early returns in a non-binding referendum. With four of 21 precincts counted, 692 voters opposed lighting <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> for night baseball and 237 supported night games.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in February approved lights at <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, the only major-league ballpark without them, after years of controversy. The issue pitted neighborhood groups concerned about noise, litter and parking problems against the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>' owners, <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which argued the team was losing prime-time television revenues. The latest bid for office by Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who lost the mayor's office to <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in 1983 after one term, was made without the backing of the party, which supported her opponent, Mrs. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> became a Republican after a failed third-party challenge to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> six years ago with 51.6 percent of the vote after the toughest campaign fight of his career. His office attributed the tight race to redistricting. The LaRouche candidates were back two years after winning the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor and secretary of state. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> tried without success this year to remove La Rouche candidates from the party. In the 21st Congressional District, the winner of the Democratic fight will face Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffner </PERSON>, who was unopposed in the primary. In 1986, he came within 943 votes of upsetting Price, who is leaving <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> after 44 years. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> held his 22nd District seat from 1955 to 1975, when he retired for health reasons, and in 1985 returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for two additional terms.

<HEAD>Dukakis Puts Best Face on Third-Place Finish In Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared himself undaunted by a third-place finish in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, saying `` the field is wide open'' in coming contests. `` Now we move on to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> where there are no favorite sons,'' a somewhat subdued <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday night at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> television station. Two Illinois home-state favorites _ Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and civil rights leader <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has made <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> his home _ finished well ahead of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. On the other hand, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' showing was far better than that of Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who failed to demonstrate any appreciable strength outside his Southern base. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his third-place showing in a state where he invested more than $ 350,000 was not a setback. `` I do n't get disappointed. ... I was running against two citizens of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> who had strong bases and a great deal of support from those who know them,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We did what I can characterize was a respectable third.'' Those around the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor echoed his contention that his showing was good under the circumstances. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, `` We did as well as we expected.'' Campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> added, `` We did beat all the non-favorite sons.'' During the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had said a vote for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would increase the chances of a brokered <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, something he said would be a `` disaster.'' Tuesday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I've been making a number of calls around the country to key Democrats and there is an overwhelming sentiment that we should get behind a nominee. `` I do n't believe we have any front-runners; I do n't think we're going to have a front-runner until the convention,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said The seven days between Super Tuesday and the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary left <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> too little time to attract strong support in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he said. But he said effort and money expended in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> will pay off later, if he is the Democratic nominee. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't about to make any bold predictions on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucus March 26 `` I do n't have to win any primary. I have to do as well as I possibly can. When you have a multi-candidate field, the vote tends to get split up,'' he said, adding that he hoped <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> would help winnow the field. <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the big Democratic loser on Super Tuesday, would be competing fiercely with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for labor votes in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Investigators are trying to learn whether <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was behind a plot to ship weapons from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to forces loyal to him in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, federal officials say. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials suspect the ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> president may have been instrumental in abortive plans to supply automatic rifles and submachine guns for an 80-member force. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chief American attorney, however, denies <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was involved in any arms shipments. `` That's a dry well for you, my friend,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There's no truth to that allegation.'' Details of the planned arms sale surfaced here last fall during a federal trial of <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>, a disbarred <PERSON> Hewlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, lawyer convicted of conspiring to export weapons illegally. At trial, the government said the arms were bound for <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. But two federal officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said last week that authorities believe the weapons were for pro-Marcos forces in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>, two men acquitted in the case and one who pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution were arrested in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Service `` sting.'' No arms were alleged to have changed hands. The officials said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> is a focus of the continuing investigation. During the trial, the prosecutor said <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> had worked with <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> on the arms deal, but <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> was not charged. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> have been linked to <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporter and former provincial governor later linked by Philippine military sources to an August 1987 coup attempt in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Dulay, detained by authorities in August 1986 on the grounds of a Marcos-owned estate near <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> were his `` lawyers'' who had sent him to clean up the court-sealed property at <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' request. A newspaper in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> reported last week that <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> was contacted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities who traveled there seeking his cooperation in the investigation of alleged arms shipments to pro-Marcos groups. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Monday confirmed that he met with <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> last week, but said he could not comment further because of an `` ongoing criminal investigation.'' <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabe </PERSON>, deputy chief of mission at the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> recently `` surfaced in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and joined Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>'' before being deported to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, where he faces charges in the 1986 slayings of three campaign workers of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since his 1986 ouster and the election of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as president. He has said he wishes to return to his homeland. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters failed in two 1987 coup attempts. Last year, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee played secretly recorded conversations with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and said that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had sought to buy weapons for shipment to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The weapons discussed in the House testimony allegedly were to be used for a coup attempt in late June, four months after <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>'s arrest It could not be determined if the alleged June coup attempt, the <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> case and the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> investigation were related. A government source said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities suspect a link between <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> arms case, but declined to provide specifics. <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morua </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>'s co-defendant who pleaded guilty, was questioned recently by federal authorities about a possible link between <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and the weapons deal, said <PERSON> Morua </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzblau </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Morua </PERSON> provided no information. Several government officials with knowledge of the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that to discuss the case openly could jeopardize a prosecution. Neither <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office, would comment on the case. `` Our policy is never to confirm or deny any inquiry,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, Customs' director of illegal export investigations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> issued a statement denying he was `` bent on taking control -LRB- of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> -RRB- through violent means.'' The news that authorities are pressing the investigation in this new direction surfaced last Wednesday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in sentencing <PERSON> Morua </PERSON> here, referred to a continuing probe. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> did not return repeated phone calls this week and last at his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a private company. <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>, sentenced to four years, said he could not comment on the matter because he was appealing his conviction.

<HEAD>Man Conquers North America's Highest Peak Solo; Lives To Talk

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An American, the first mountaineer to conquer <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s highest peak alone in winter, left a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> flag atop <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> to honor the man who tried _ and failed _ before him. <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejas </PERSON> ended a monthlong ordeal of screaming winds and subzero temperatures on Tuesday, picked up by plane on <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>'s flank and flown to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, 130 miles to the south During the climb Tejas often thought about Japanese climber <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON>, the only other person to reach the 20,320-foot summit in a solo winter climb but who disappeared during his descent in February 1984 and was never found. `` Many times I was wondering, ` Is this where he slipped? Is this where he lost it?''' <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` I think I figured out where he bought the farm up there. There was one area, on summit day, I was coming back down. It's very steep, very exposed, and you feel that if you make one mistake, you could die.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION>, a stocky 35-year-old with beard and shaved head, had climbed <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> 12 times, usually as a guide during the May-June climbing season. Even then, in relatively milder conditions, about a third of several hundred climbers who attempt the climb turn back short of the summit. Snow-covered <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> is infamous for hurricane-force winds that rage for days, temperatures that dip to minus 60, and whiteouts that make it hard to know up from down. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION>' planned two-week trek took a month. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION>, who lives in <LOCATION> Talkeetna </LOCATION>, which is used as a staging area for McKinley climbers, was dropped off Feb. 16 at the mountain's 7,200-foot level On the second day, a storm came and kept him in his snow cave for three days. He eventually went onto half rations, then half rations every other day. `` I ended up working at my margin. It was around the edge of safety several times.'' Twice, he found earlier climbers' food caches that helped him survive. On March 7, he waited out a storm and made a dash to the top during a whiteout. `` I could n't see where I was going. After 12 times to the summit, I can feel my way up to it, but it was n't as pretty or spectacular as I'd hoped for,'' he said. `` I took a few pictures, left a few mementos, turned around and headed down. I left a Japanese flag in memory of <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON>, and I also left a can of Spam. There was no meat in it. I ate it. I was very hungry.'' He made it back the same day to 17,000 feet and rested overnight. The next day, he contacted pilot <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> by two-way radio and started down. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> appeared in good shape when he arrived Tuesday in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, but he said the mountain had pushed him to his mental, physical, and emotional limits. `` You go, ` This is ridiculous. This is a hill, this is the middle of winter, I'm a lone guy out here. There are crevasses all around, there's danger. What am I doing here?''' Safe on level ground, he answered his own question. `` To live in a very harsh environment, to do something very stressful and straining like that, is a challenge,'' he said. `` I was at the limits of my ability. It was a good test. I'd never spent a month by myself. I found out I really liked myself.''

<HEAD>Robertson Scales Back Campaign, But Vows To Continue To Convention</HEAD>

 Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> ran a distant third in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary but repeated his vow to continue his campaign to the national convention. `` I am in all the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Tuesday night, insisting that he was `` not a bit in the world disappointed'' over the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> results. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has spent nearly $ 25 million on a campaign that has gained 17 national convention delegates, according to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tally. The federal spending limit for primary campaigns is $ 27 million. Thus, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> acknowledged, he must run a drastically scaled-back effort from here on. `` My own personal travel will continue but as far as a full-blown media campaign, I ca n't afford that any more,'' he said after meeting Tuesday afternoon with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> But </PERSON>, he added: `` I have enough money to keep in the race through ... the convention.'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said the exact amount that could be spent before hitting the limit would not be known before the next seven to 10 days. `` Whether it's between $ 2 million and $ 3 million or less than $ 2 million it will be enough for the campaign,'' he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON>, national field director for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, characterized the new campaign as `` mean and lean. We have always been labor-intensive and have won on organization and grass-roots support from volunteers.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which holds its primary June 7, to help local candidates with their races. `` We would like to see Republican majorities enunciating major conservative causes by 1990 or 1992,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said his meeting with <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> was mainly to plan the role of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> delegates in the convention. `` We talked about housekeeping things,'' he said. <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> said the talks were to ensure that the convention went smoothly, and that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s backers, many of whom have never attended a national convention, are included in the preparation for the event. `` Our goal is to unify the party,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` I am going to be the conservative champion.''

But the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator has been without a win for three weeks, and the primary calendar offers him little hope: the next <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest is March 29 in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, another one of the vice president's home states. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> returned home for a few days, flying into <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as the disappointing <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> results began unfolding. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolled up more than half of the popular vote, and more importantly, held a 3-1 ratio in distribution of the 82 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates. Despite the bleak news, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters, `` We're doing all right. We're just going to hang in there. There's a long way to go yet.'' Pressed on whether he would continue his candidacy, he said, `` We're staying in, we're staying in.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign was stunned by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 16-state sweep on Super Tuesday, and he ordered massive staff layoffs and a halt to all advertising in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> late last week. At the urging of some aides, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> considered giving up his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hopes but decided to stay in. He campaigned in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary voters went to the polls, saying: `` I do n't give up very easily.'' In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, he said, `` This is called a surprise state from time to time. We're ready for one. We could use it.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has n't had much to cheer about since Feb. 23, when he won contests in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. A week before that, he was surprised by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s come-from-behind win in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the first signal of chaos in <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign. Little over a month ago, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the early leader with his impressive victory over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Exit Polls Show `Little Chinks' in Bush's Armor Despite Big
Illinois Win</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolled up a victory in the Republican primary in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, exit polls indicated `` little chinks in his armor'' that could bedevil him in the general election, analysts say. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday overwhelmed Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in virtually all ideological and demographic groups of the Republican electorate, cementing his huge lead in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race. `` It's a blowout,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. Results were far less clear on the Democratic side, where Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> cashed in on his favorite-son status and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rode another huge wave of black support to finish first and second respectively in their home state. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swamped his Republican opponents, his ratings on leadership and toughness were weaker than may be expected from a prohibitive front-runner, said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON>. Additionally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> failed to win the independents who voted in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. `` If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to win the general election, he's got to start attracting independent voters,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll chief <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>. The results did not foreshadow problems for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> within the GOP; he even won among former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s natural supporters, born-again Christians and voters concerned about so-called `` morality issues. But among the 23 percent of Republicans who said leadership was a key issue, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> split the vote, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> found. `` A prohibitive front-runner should be showing some leadership, particularly given the fact that he holds the second-highest office in the land,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. In <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll, 55 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was tough enough to be a good president, but 24 percent said he was not and 21 percent were not sure. The 55 percent was `` a pretty small number,'' considering that it came among Republican primary voters, said <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON>. Thirty 30 percent of Republicans told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be a very strong leader, 42 percent said he would be somewhat strong, 16 percent said not very strong, 6 percent said not at all strong and 6 percent did n't know. Again, `` That's not a terrific standing among Republican primary voters,'' <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON> said. In another measure, a plurality of Republican voters, 41 percent, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not fully disclosed his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair, while 32 percent said he had and 21 percent were not sure, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> found. While the issue has not been a significant one in the minds of Republican voters, `` it's there,'' <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON> said. `` That's a tomorrow story,'' one that could gain significance in the general election. These <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> results amounted to `` little chinks in his armor,'' not major campaign problems, <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> noted that the flaws spotted in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll also were minor, with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> beating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among the tiny number of Republicans who rated `` honesty'' or `` getting things done'' as key. `` It does n't tell us all that much about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s electability,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. `` But it certainly indicates he's not a prohibitive favorite to beat a Democrat.'' In the Democratic race, weaknesses were demonstrated most strongly by Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who failed to turn his Super Tuesday victories into a sizable showing, and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, who finished last. `` The G-boys just did n't show,'' said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. `` They were squeezed by the hometown favorites.'' One favorite, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, even drew voters who doubt he can succeed. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said just 40 percent of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s supporters gave him the best chance to win in November, and 35 percent named <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even though they voted for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said only 35 percent of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s voters thought he would win the nomination, while 39 percent picked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win it. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> enjoyed his now-customary huge black support: He received 91 percent of the black vote, which was about a quarter of the Democratic turnout, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. But he won only 8 percent of the white vote by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s count, 7 percent by the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> still ca n't attract any white votes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitofsky </ORGANIZATION>. `` He got 7 percent. And that's not enough.'' Though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finished third, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said a plurality of Democrats, 35 percent, thought he had the best chance of winning the general election. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 27 percent, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 18 percent. The margin of sampling error for the results was about 5 points for most subgroups.

<HEAD>Congress OKs Prime Site for Black Patriots Monument</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has given final congressional approval to legislation authorizing prime federal parkland in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a national monument to the 5,000 black patriots who served in the American Revolution. The voice vote by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday followed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the bill on Feb. 26. The House is expected to approve similar, Senate-backed legislation today that would authorize a choice <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> site for a national memorial to Americans who fought in the Korean War. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the Korean War memorial, to be built on the mall that extends from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol, will be `` a fitting and long-overdue monument to the 55,000 Amricans who lost their lives in a forgotten war.'' Private sponsors say they have raised $ 2.5 million toward a goal of $ 10 million for the Korean War memorial. The black patriots monument, also expected to be built on the mall, will cost an estimated $ 4 million. Both the black patriots and the Korean War monuments previously were authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and will be built with private donations.

 A group of judges that makes policy for the federal courts is urging the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to consider impeaching <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, who is scheduled to go to prison for perjury on March 23. The group, the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, on Tuesday unanimously supported a resolution that says `` consideration of impeachment may be warranted.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, 59, was sentenced to five years in prison following his 1986 perjury conviction. He has remained a judge but has not been hearing cases since he was indicted in 1985 although he continues to be paid his annual salary of $ 89,500. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> would forfeit his salary and his eligibility for a pension at age 65 if he is impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and removed from office by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The recommendation that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consider impeaching him was approved by a vote of 24-0 by the judges' group. Three members abstained, including Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, who traditionally does not vote on such matters. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> is the third federal judge ever to be indicted for crimes allegedly committed while in office.

<HEAD>Panel Blames Flying Instructor in 1987 Utah Commuter Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal panel has determined that the primary cause of a 1987 collision that killed 10 people in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> was an instructor's failure to keep his plane out of restricted airspace during a student training flight. The single-engine training plane collided with a <ORGANIZATION> SkyWest </ORGANIZATION> commuter plane near <LOCATION> Kearns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, on Jan. 15, 1987, while making an approach to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a flight from <LOCATION> Pocatello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday absolved the air traffic controller handling the <ORGANIZATION> SkyWest </ORGANIZATION> plane. The other aircraft was flying under visual flight rules and was not under the direction of air traffic control. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the accident might have been avoided if the private aircraft had equipment that would have provided the controller information on the plane's altitude. Investigators said the single-engine <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> M-20C was on the radar screen, but without altitude information the controller would not have known the two planes were about to collide. The safety board put the primary blame for the accident on the instructor of the private aircraft's `` lack of navigational vigilance ... which led to the unauthorized intrusion'' into the restricted airspace that surrounds the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport.

<HEAD>US Official Urges End to Speeding Penalties For States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal official is telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that states whose drivers ignore the 55 mph speed limit should not be penalized, but two senior lawmakers said they are writing bills that would do just the opposite. Reps. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> surface transportation subcommittee, said they are working on measures that would extend the penalties to states that have adopted the 65 mph limit States with 55 mph limits can lose up to 10 percent of their federal highway aid if monitors find that more than half their motorists are driving too fast. But when two laws were passed last year allowing 65 mph driving on many rural highways, the penalties were not extended to roads where states allow the faster speeds. `` The states are clearly in the best position to determine where speed enforcement is needed to enhance safety,'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement delivered Tuesday to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s panel. `` They should be able to deploy enforcement personnel accordingly, without the threat of losing federal funds.'' Lawmakers from the 11 states that have retained the 55 mph limit have complained that it is unfair for their states to face the loss of federal assistance while states that permit faster driving can not be penalized for motorists speeding on 65 mph roads.

<HEAD>Studies Say Changes Needed at VA, With or Without Cabinet-Level
Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An independent study group says significant changes are needed in the way the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is being managed whether or not it is elevated to Cabinet status. In its report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a panel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it found `` little evidence'' in its study that Cabinet-level status would materially improve the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s mission of providing for the present and future needs of veterans. `` The panel does not believe that such an elevation would significantly improve either access to the president, the adequacy of necessary resources, or the organization, management and delivery of high-quality services and benefits,'' the report said. The seven-member panel said it `` does recognize the potential political value of raising the public visibility of the needs of veterans and the programs designed to meet these needs by making <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> a department in the president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. However, given the broad political support which already exists for the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and its programs, the gain would be at the margin.'' The academy panel and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, did not make recommendations on whether the VA should become part of the president's Cabinet.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, bundled against biting winds and subzero temperatures, widened her lead and seemed assured of an unprecedented third straight victory in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Butcher, who left this checkpoint just as her closest competitor arrived Tuesday, was expected to cross the finish line in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> today. If Butcher wins, it will be the fourth consecutive year that a woman has won the 16-year-old race. <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddles </PERSON> of Teller won in 1985, and Butcher won in 1986 and 1987, setting a course record each year. Butcher left <LOCATION> Elim </LOCATION>, 123 miles from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, at 5:11 p.m. Tuesday, after stopping in the Eskimo village for two hours to feed and rest her dog team. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> arrived two minutes before she left. Butcher, a resident of <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION>, took the lead early Tuesday and has not yielded it. She left <PERSON> Elim </PERSON> with 10 of the 17 dogs she started with March 5 in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>; the others were dropped at checkpoints along the trail. <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> was traveling with 12 of his original 20 dogs still in harness. Subzero temperatures and biting winds continued to hinder the leaders, and weather forecasters said the wind chill factor could sink to minus 70 degrees along the trail's final miles. In each of her two previous victories, Butcher proved the strength and endurance of her team in the final, windswept miles along the barren <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast. Her elapsed time last year was 11 days, 2 hours. Her closest rival last year was four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> of Two Rivers, who ran neck-and-neck with Butcher until his dogs refused to continue just 22 miles from the finish. This year, <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> was about six hours behind Butcher at last report, leaving <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION> at 2 p.m. Tuesday in third place. Running in fourth was <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnie </PERSON> of Teller. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nayokpuk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shishmaref </LOCATION> was fifth. Seventy-year-old <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Redington </PERSON> of <PERSON> Knik </PERSON>, who took an early lead and held it for more than 400 miles, was sixth. <LOCATION> Redington </LOCATION>, known as the `` Father of the Iditarod'' for organizing the first race in 1973, has run all but two races and placed as high as fifth, but has yet to win. The first musher to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> collects $ 30,000 of a $ 150,000 purse; the next 19 finishers split the rest. Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out.

<TEXT>
 Until this week, almost no one had heard of <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-Leung </PERSON>, reputed drug kingpin. He was n't on any list of most wanted criminals and he'd never been the subject of a crime commission hearing or a newspaper story. Today, <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> is accused of leading a conspiracy to smuggle as much as 1,000 pounds of Southeast Asian heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, far more than in such notorious cases as the `` Pizza Connection'' from <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> and the `` French Connection'' through <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION>. Authorities say they seized 570 pounds of the Kon network's heroin The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bureau calls the amount `` almost mind-boggling'' compared with 200 pounds in the Pizza Connection and the 70 pounds in the French Connection. Considered equally mind-boggling is the fact that such a huge operator was not the agency's No. 1 target, as one prosecutor claimed, but just one of several large Asian importers. They have, according to authorities, increased their share of the city's heroin business from 3 percent to 70 percent during the last five years, displacing the Mafia Despite the enormity of the 44-year-old <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s alleged operation, his rivals are expected to have no trouble supplying <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 225,000 heroin addicts _ half the national total And there will be more drug lords. `` Today's courier is tomorrow's king,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strang </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Tuesday. `` That makes it difficult for law enforcement. ... It's not like the traditional organized crime families, where there's an organization with an observable hierarchy.'' `` Many people feel that because of this arrest we've solved the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> heroin problem,'' he added. `` We have n't. He's only one of several major traffickers.'' <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>, whom the police call <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>, was arrested Sunday night outside the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>. He was wearing a $ 25,000 diamond-studded <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON> watch and a gold bracelet with a <ORGANIZATION> Buddha </ORGANIZATION> charm, and carried $ 32 in a pocket of his dark business suit. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> told the judge at his arraignment he could not afford to hire a lawyer. He was held without bail in the federal jail in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> admitted to the agents who arrested him he was a smuggler _ of gems and cigarettes, authorities said. Investigators told a different story: that <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> may have imported up to $ 1 billion in heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between 1984 and 1987. He was described as a shadowy figure with a half-dozen counterfeit passports in as many different names, who may have bribed high officials in several nations. Money, apparently, is not one of his problems. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that on a recent night <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> lost $ 1 million at a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> casino `` and walked out laughing.'' Federal prosecutor <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> described <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> as `` a big spender. He enjoys big meals, good times and buying expensive things for people.'' <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> came to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s attention in 1984, when a shipment of 250 pounds of heroin believed destined for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seized in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> harbor. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>, a Shanghai-area native living in the British colony, fled before he could be arrested, authorities said.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has produced the most radical budget since it came to power nine years ago, driving home a capitalist revolution with big tax cuts for the wealthy. In Parliament on Tuesday, the rage of a frustrated opposition boiled over into an unprecedented uproar. One member was expelled and the session was twice suspended while Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> battled to deliver his budget speech. Labor Party outrage at the slashing of the top tax rate from 60 percent to 40 percent and Conservative government delight at producing the first budget surplus for nearly 20 years underlined the chasm between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two major parties. It also signaled that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, at her most confident since winning a third five-year term last summer, does not plan on yielding an inch to the opposition, or to more widespread pressure to increase spending on the ailing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> gave what opposition leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> called `` handouts to the rich'' in a society that critics charged is increasingly polarized between the better off and the poor, between depressed north and booming south. For the Conservatives, Tuesday was a high point and a vindication of rigorous policies: the day <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> shrugged off years of budget deficits and demonstrated it has combined the fastest growth in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with low inflation and a budget funded by the generation of wealth, not borrowing. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was able to achieve tax reform, but it lamentably failed to achieve a balanced budget,'' said a jubilant <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the top <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official who presented the budget to the House of Commons. `` What is a substantial achievement is to do both ... What I have been able to tell you is a story of success. A story of the transformation of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s fortunes.'' The package contained what were widely regarded as the most sweeping tax reforms in modern British history. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> replaced the previous six brackets of income tax rates with just two, a new base rate cut to 25 percent from 27 percent, and the top 40 percent rate, which is payable on income over $ 35,700. The corporation tax was unchanged at 35 percent. In a single swoop, the British top tax rate fell to among the lowest in industrialized nations, apart from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Lower taxes are a cornerstone of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s free-enterprise policy, basic to encouraging business, keeping talent from fleeing to tax havens and generating wealth and competitiveness. The government goal, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said, is a 20 percent basic tax rate. When Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won power from a socialist administration in 1979 the basic tax rate was 33 percent and top rate 83 percent. Apart from doubling taxes on company cars, Tuesday's budget was almost all good news for the well-off. For the Briton on average earnings of $ 23,125 a year, Tuesday's tax cuts meant an extra $ 9.25 a week For big earners, on $ 185,000 and up, savings began at $ 462.50 a week. Across the TV news programs Tuesday night flashed the faces of the even richer, such as retail chain store boss Sir <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON> who'll be taking home nearly half a million dollars more a year after the tax changes come into force in April. Amid jeers from the left and cheers from big business, there were signs the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> recipe will work again to allay resentment. `` We're In the Money, Folks'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest selling daily, the 4-million circulation Sun, declared today. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> carried a banner headline, `` <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s Tax Triumph.'' The budget announcement came just a month before a new tightening up on welfare comes into force. Among others things, about 6 million low-income households will lose all or part of rent subsidies because they have savings of more than $ 11,100. And welfare payments to the poor for household items such as kitchen stoves will be switched to loans. `` There never was a more obvious example of the rich getting richer and the poor getting demonstrably poorer,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s finance spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` It's an outrageous and disgusting budget.'' Retorted <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, a treasury spokesman: `` You do n't make the poor richer by making the rich poorer.''

<HEAD>Study Suggests `Greenhouse' Warming Of Atmosphere Killed Dinosaurs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An asteroid collision with Earth may have released enough gas to heat the planet 65 million years ago, causing gradual extinction of dinosaurs and other species by destroying their food, researchers say. The study drew guarded praise from a critic of the theory, because the findings attempt to explain why only certain creatures became extinct and why the extinctions were gradual, not sudden. The asteroid impact theory differs from ones in which scientists said such a collision caused mass extinction by kicking up enough dust to block sunlight, plunging the planet into a freezing darkness that killed plants, a source of food. <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> and geophysicist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahrens </PERSON> reached their conclusion by analyzing experiments in which <PERSON> Ahrens </PERSON> and geophysicist <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> shot steel bullets into rocks at 4,500 mph. Based on the amount of carbon dioxide released by the shattered rocks, the scientists calculated that a 6-mile-diameter asteroid hitting limestone or other carbon-rich rocks on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> would have released enough carbon dioxide to increase the amount of the gas in the atmosphere two to five times. Such an increase in the gas, which traps solar heat like glass in a greenhouse, could have caused a `` greenhouse effect'' that warmed the planet by 9 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit for 10,000 years after the asteroid struck, <PERSON> Ahrens </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The leafy plants which dinosaurs ate were selectively destroyed'' by the heat while other plants survived, <PERSON> Ahrens </PERSON> said. `` So there was probably -LRB- increased -RRB- competition for available food, and eventually food supplies declined to a point where different species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct in a less-than-sudden manner.'' Fossils show dinosaurs and other creatures became extinct gradually, while many species survived. Many biologists and paleontologists argue the mass extinction 65 million years ago was caused by gradual climate change, not an asteroid or other sudden catastrophe. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>, paleontology chairman at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, and a leading critic of asteroid theories, said he was skeptical of the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory because the dinosaurs started to die earlier than 65 million years ago. But he called their study `` clearly a positive step'' because it is consistent with gradual, selective extinction. <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> will present the study Thursday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> at the 19th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Scientists debating the dinosaurs' extinction fall into two main camps: those who blame gradual climate change and those who blame catastrophe. Catastrophe theorists disagree on whether an asteroid or gigantic volcanic eruption was to blame. Geophysicist Charles Officer of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> said he believes the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory does not have merit because geologic evidence supports the theory that volcanoes spewed enough ash skyward to block sunlight and cause mass extinction. Geochemist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, disagreed, saying the theory that the asteroid triggered greenhouse warming of the atmosphere is probably sound. While other scientists previously suggested the greenhouse effect caused the extinctions, they said the carbon dioxide was generated by volcanoes, changes in ocean circulation, or acid rain that dissolved carbon-rich rocks. It is important to learn what killed the dinosaurs because `` it behooves us to find out if we're just sort of sitting here awaiting another -LRB- asteroid -RRB- impact to seal our doom, or if some of the things we're doing to the environment might ... lead to the extinction of many species,'' <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> said. Scientists believe rising levels of carbon dixoide and other greenhouse gases will warm Earth 3 to 5 degrees by the year 2050, possibly causing crop-threatening droughts and partly melting polar ice caps to raise sea levels and threaten coastal cities. <PERSON> Ahrens </PERSON> said an asteroid impact not only may have triggered greenhouse heating, but possibly caused chemical reactions that formed intense acid rain, which either killed many creatures directly or wiped out their food plants. <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>, however, wondered how birds and other surviving species could have hidden from the corrosive downpour.

 Hundreds of prison guards here have engaged in corruption including drug sales and aiding escapes, the district attorney said in announcing the first nine arrests from a continuing investigation. Authorities say seven guards, one prison cook and an inmate were charged as a result of `` Operation Ferret,'' an investigation begun 18 months ago. `` The investigation will potentially yield the largest number of arrests related to official misconduct by correctional officers in this country's history,'' District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday. `` We are gathering the evidence to present to the special grand jury that will lead to the arrest or discipline of hundreds of guards over the coming months,'' <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said. The crimes include selling drugs to inmates, bringing money and other contraband into the city's five prisons and providing handcuff keys to aid escapes, <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said. `` The investigation will lead to the exposure and elimination of a massive network of corruption and criminal activity among self-serving <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> prison employees and prison inmates,'' <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said. Prison Superintendent <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> acknowledged that employees targeted in the investigation will continue to guard inmates until charged. He said the situation will pose no security problems. `` We have a sufficient number of employees to handle the system,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. `` We have stepped up recruiting activities. And as soon as charges are filed by the grand jury, we will suspend and fire.'' The prison system houses up to 9,000 inmates and employs 1,400 guards and 350 other workers. The two instances cited in the grand jury's report involved one guard, the cook and an inmate in an escape and six guards in a beating that hospitalized an inmate who reported a guard sleeping at his post. <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> declined to say how many escapes guards allowed. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said a federally financed <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> aided the investigation, which according to <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> relied on undercover officers, cooperating inmates and guards and electronic surveillance. Guard <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiest </PERSON>, 42; prison cook <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Suder </PERSON>, 37; and inmate <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, 39, were charged with helping inmate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Longendorfer </PERSON> escape from the <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> minimum-security unit in 1987. <PERSON> Longendorfer </PERSON>, who was serving time for terroristic threats and indecent assault, cooperated in the investigation, allowing authorities to videotape the escape, according to court documents. <PERSON> Suder </PERSON> accepted a $ 1,000 bribe and a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said. The six other guards were charged with an unprovoked physical assault on inmate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on Feb. 16. Those charged were officers <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Sammie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 41; <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 50; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Favano </PERSON>, 44; and Sgt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 50. <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said the investigation of the assault uncovered other reports of brutality. `` There is no question there is a serious problem within the walls of the prisons, and with these arrests, starting now, we hope to send out two messages,'' said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>. `` One, to those employees engaged in criminal activities that we will find them and arrest them, and to those employees who discharge their services with pride, we say to them that we need you.'' Other corruption cases in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> have resulted in the conviction of 34 police officers since 1983 on federal bribery and conspiracy charges. They included a deputy commissioner for extorting money from vice figures. Twelve judges were suspended last year for allegedly accepting cash from Roofers' Union members. Three of the judges have been convicted of bribery in recent months.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> captain's wife who is dying from breast cancer that went undiagnosed by military doctors for almost two years has won more than $ 1 million in damages from the government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> awarded <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, and her husband, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, $ 550,000 in compensatory damages, $ 415,000 for lost earnings and $ 100,000 for medical expenses she is expected to incur. `` Neither consoling words nor monetary damages can be expected to fully compensate the truly grievous injury Mrs. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> sustained and will continue to endure,'' the judge said in his opinion, which was issued Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, whose doctors have given her anywhere from a few months to a year to live, said in court that she `` would like other women to be aware'' of what happened to her. She said women who find breast lumps `` should n't be humiliated by their doctors and should n't be embarrassed to get a second or third opinion'' if they are unsatisfied with their diagnoses. Mrs. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a former civilian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee and the mother of a 3-year-old son, testified last month that she sought medical help from military doctors in 1984 and 1985 after she felt a lump in her right breast and experienced bleeding from the nipple. Both times, her male doctors gave her mammograms and blood tests, but told her the lump was nothing to worry about, she said. One physician told her he thought she needed psychological help because of her fears of the disease, she testified. A biopsy, ordered by a female military physician in late 1985 showed that the lump was malignant. She underwent a radical modified mastectomy and reconstructive surgery in January 1986, at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>. She quit her job to recuperate and joined her husband in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but the cancer reappeared.

In the end, the task force came up with 30 recommendations to get more New Yorkers to the polls by, among other things, allowing college students to register to vote in their college communities when they register for classes. The group also recommended that elementary and secondary schools be required to offer classes that stress the importance of voting, that public employees be allowed to assist New Yorkers in filling out voter registration cards, and that the state create a permanent state primary day. The state primary day has varied from summer to fall during recent elections. It is scheduled for Sept. 8 this year.

 Apathy often is blamed for low voter turnouts, but the real reason people do n't go to the polls may be found in examining voter registration laws, says a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Many states have voter registration laws that discriminate against the electorate by making it difficult to register, contends political science Professor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenstone </PERSON>, who is coordinating a nationwide study of registration laws. <PERSON> Rosenstone </PERSON> said preliminary research suggests that modified voter registration laws would increase overall voter turnout by about 9 percent, bringing about 16 million more people to the polls. `` Blacks, Hispanics and the poor would benefit the most from the changes,'' said <PERSON> Rosenstone </PERSON>, who is coordinating the nationwide project funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. In most states, voters have to register weeks before interest peaks on election day, leave work early or travel an inconvenient distance to the registration office, and finally, stand in a long line, <PERSON> Rosenstone </PERSON> said. Almost half the 180 million eligible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> voters, including more than half of the 20 million eligible black voters, are n't expected to go to the polls in November, <PERSON> Rosenstone </PERSON> said. `` Contrast this situation to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where registration officials go door to door to make sure every eligible voter is on the rolls. Their election-day turnout averages about 68 percent _ about 15 percent higher than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A jury awarded $ 1.45 million to a man left paralyzed from a 1985 wasp sting at an inn. The jury Tuesday awarded the money to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Febesh </PERSON>, 68, after finding the the Fox Hollow Inn of <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION> liable for the sting that within an hour put him into a three-week coma. <PERSON> Febesh </PERSON>, former manager of the golf program at the <ORGANIZATION> Doral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, is unable to talk, feed himself or use his arms and legs in any way at all, according to his lawyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Febesh </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, was awarded $ 250,000 for loss of her husband's companionship and services. The Febeshes were at a 50th wedding anniversary party in the garden of the inn when they noticed yellow jackets around the garbage and the food. They told the head waiter, who shrugged off the situation, <ORGANIZATION> Napoli </ORGANIZATION> said, and about an hour later <PERSON> Febesh </PERSON> was stung in the hand. <ORGANIZATION> Napoli </ORGANIZATION> said the wasp's venom attacked <PERSON> Febesh </PERSON>'s brain stem and part of his spinal cord, putting him in a coma. He said <PERSON> Febesh </PERSON>, paralyzed since regaining consciousness, is undergoing physical therapy at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> hospital. The jury, after a 10-day trial before <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON>, awarded $ 3.4 million to the Febeshes. The court reduced the verdict by half after the jury found the couple 50 percent negligent. Lawyers for the inn argued that the Febeshes should have left the area if they were worried about the yellow jackets.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, elected on the promise of ending waste in government and changing <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s image of cronyism, dove headfirst into the state's financial problems by ordering budget cuts and calling the Legislature into special session During his first full day in office Tuesday, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> also huddled with legislative leaders, visited with foreign dignitaries and took time out to pose for his official portrait. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> went to work on measures to solve the fiscal crisis immediately after his Oct. 24 election victory over Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and said Tuesday included `` more of the same.'' `` I really feel like I've been doing this for 100 days,'' he said at a news conference. `` I feel the same. I'm still feel excited about it after 24 hours. I feel good getting into the substance of it.'' Just hours after he was inaugurated Monday, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> turned down a stay of execution for <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>, convicted of killing a <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> police officer in 1978. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> died in the electric chair shortly after midnight. While <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> settled into his new job, former officials of the <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> administration jammed the three main elevators in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s skyscraper Capitol, moving out boxes of personal belongings. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> ordered $ 7.9 million in immediate spending cuts and summoned the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> into a 10-day special session next Monday to consider government reorganization and giving him emergency power to cut spending through the rest of the fiscal year without lawmakers' approval. The largest of the new cuts include $ 2.6 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.2 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, and about $ 1.1 million from the vocational education system. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> faces an accumulated four-year budget deficit and cash shortfall of $ 1.2 billion. The governor can cut up to 20 percent from any budget unit without legislative approval. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said one idea under consideration was asking for the power to cut up to 20 percent from an entire agency and eliminate entire state programs. The governor also said he was developing other executive orders to save the state 10s millions of dollars, primarily through budget cuts that <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> refused to impose at <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s request. `` We are in a position in this fiscal year where the numbers drive the policy and not the policy driving the numbers,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` When this state is busted, broke, when the deficit is approaching a number too large to comprehend, the numbers are driving this now.'' To alleviate a cash-flow deficit that threatens to shut down state government, about $ 156 million in additional cuts from the state's $ 5.3 billion budget will have to be found, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> approved about $ 36 million in reductions before leaving office and <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s budget team plans to delay state payments to retirement systems, hold up income tax refund checks and push one state payday into the next fiscal year to conserve cash. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has said new taxes probably will be needed to overcome the budget deficit. However, he said that topic would not be considered during the special session. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> met Tuesday with representatives of the government of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> about the possibility of building an industrial plant in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. After Monday's inauguration, the governor met with business representatives from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>.

 Military authorities today announced the arrests of nine suspected <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, two of them regional party officials, in the latest blow to the crippled insurgency.

The impoverished northeast was once the stronghold of the Communists, who fielded about 12,000 fighters at the peak of power in the late 1970s.

<TEXT>
 Indian soldiers shot and killed at least 24 Tamil rebels during search operations in two northeastern districts, a Sri Lankan military official said today. The official, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the operations in the <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kilinochchi </LOCATION> districts began early Tuesday and lasted the entire day. He said eight of those killed were women and that at least four rebels were injured. More than 300 Indian soldiers backed by helicopter gunships and tanks were involved in the operation, the official said. The search operations follow the killing of members of the majority Sinhalese community, allegedly by the rebels, in neighbouring <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> district and retaliatory killings of Tamils by an outlawed Sinhalese group. At least 98 people have died in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> in the past two weeks. The official said the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> also had searched unsuccessfully for members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese organization. At least 50,000 Indian soldiers are in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to disarm Tamil rebels, who have been waging a separatist guerilla war since 1983. The Indians were deployed under a peace accord which granted limited autonomy to the minority Tamils in exchange for an arms surrender. But the Tamils renounced the July 29 accord last fall and since then they have been battling the Indian soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> also opposes the peace accord, saying it grants too many concessions to the Tamils. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says more than 400 soldiers and at least 1,100 rebels have died in the fighting, but the militants claim that most of the Tamils killed were civilians. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people while the Sinhalese comprise 75 percent. Tamils say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the army and the government in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>.

 Two Lebanese newspapers today published letters addressed to kidnapped <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and his pro-Iranian captors on the third anniversary of his abduction in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The independent An-Nahar and the <ORGANIZATION> Sunni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Liwa </ORGANIZATION> also published a picture of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s 2-year-old daughter <PERSON> Sulome </PERSON>, who was born after his March 16, 1985, abduction by Islamic Jihad. `` Here is Sulome, our daughter, wishing you a safe return home, daddy,'' said a letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> from <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON>, Sulome's mother. `` She often asks about you. Wondering which of all the planes she is seeing will be the one bringing daddy home ...,'' the letter said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There has been no word of him for three months. In a letter to the Shiite Moslem kidnappers, the U.S.-based Journalists' Committee To Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> pleaded with Islamic Jihad to `` release him in the name of humanity.'' `` For what crime is he paying this terrible price?'' the letter asked. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has committed no crime.'' The letters were also broadcast by a state-run television station based in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sunni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radios. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was seized before kidnappings became epidemic in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, when many foreigners lived there. Gunmen believed to be Shiite Moslem zealots abducted him as he was returning home from a game of tennis. Police say they have no information on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> or any of the other missing foreigners, who include eight other Americans. Most are held by Shiite Moslems loyal to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the revolutionary patriarch of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Lebanese government authorities have little sway in their own country after 13 years of civil war that pits Moslems against Christians and rival factions within each camp against each other. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s captors call themselves Islamic Jihad, which means Islamic Holy War. Since his abduction, they have released nine photographs and two videotapes of him. He is known to have been allowed to write to his family once, in November 1985. In his last videotaped message, delivered to a news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Christmas Eve, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> addressed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and his family. `` To my government, I do n't know what to say,'' he declared. `` To my family, I love you and miss you very much. ... I am in good health but tired and very lonely. `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I say again this can not continue. There is a limit for how long we can last and some of us are approaching their limit. ... Surely by now you know what must be done and how you can do it. `` This is difficult, but you can do it. There have been enough careful consideration, cold discussion and enough secret maneuvering.'' Services were planned in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today to commemorate <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s three years in captivity. Participants at the Holy Trinity Church were to include three former hostages _ Revs. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> and ABC News correspondent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>.

 Confusion and fear generated by AIDS has created an unlimited audience for quacks who are expected to take in $ 1 billion this year, speakers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Many persons who have AIDS will try anything to defeat it; many who do n't have AIDS will try anything to avoid it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` That makes it easy for quacks to convert every trick in their repertoire into an AIDS treatment or preventative.''

About 400 people attended the two-day conference on health fraud, including representatives of law enforcement agencies, consumer groups, medicine, insurance companies and business. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botwin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> deputy attorney general, said it was understandable that people faced with AIDS would try any treatment, and that it some cases quack treatments provided a psychological boost. `` However, many so-called AIDS treatments are sold with scare tactics, pose health hazards, or carry the risk of substantial financial loss,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tape recordings indicate President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband was killed with a gun other than that which officials claim was the murder weapon, a Japanese sound expert testified today. Based on the tapes of voices, footsteps and gunfire, <PERSON> Matsumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> also identified four soldiers as the ones who shouted the <LOCATION> Tagalog </LOCATION> words `` This is it,'' `` Let me do it'' and `` Shoot'' seconds before former Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was shot and killed on Aug. 21, 1983. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acoustics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, made the statements at the trial of 34 soldiers and three civilians accused of murdering <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Galman </PERSON>, an alleged communist agent initially tagged as the assassin. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was killed as he walked down the stairway from a <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane to the tarmac at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport under military escort. He was returning to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from three years' exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galman </PERSON> was shot and killed by soldiers immediately after <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> fell. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, speaking in Japanese through an interpreter, said he reached his conclusions after analyzing sounds picked up by journalists' tape recorders during the assassination and the test firing of various types of guns in studios in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Chief prosecutor <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s testimony supports the prosecution's claim that <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was shot on the stairway, where only soldiers were in a position to shoot him in the back of the head The military under deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was shot by <PERSON> Galman </PERSON> on the tarmac with a .357 - caliber Magnum In his testimony, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said an analysis of the tape recordings show that the first shot, which has been established as the one that killed <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, could have come only from a .45 - caliber `` The sound of the gunshot was close to the sound of a .45 - caliber automatic pistol,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> `` The sound was quite different to a great degree from the sound coming from a .357 Magnum.'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said the sound of the footsteps of <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and his four soldier escorts were clearly picked up by two boom microphones extended over the top of the stairway, as the party began descending. `` We can clearly analyze the sound of the first step to the eleventh step,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said referring to the stairway, which had 21 rungs. `` After the eleventh step ... the sound of gunfire was heard.'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said he could not pinpoint the step where <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was shot but calculated it was between the 11th and 15th rungs. The tapes also picked up the words `` Eto na'' -LRB- This is it -RRB-, followed by `` Ako na. Ako na'' -LRB- Let me do it. Let me do it -RRB- and `` <LOCATION> Pusila </LOCATION>. Pusila.'' -LRB- Shoot. Shoot. -RRB- <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said the words `` Eto na'' were uttered by Lt. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, chief of the security detail assigned to <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who remained at the top of the stairs while <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was led down. The words `` Let me do it'' were said by Sgts. Claro Lat and <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> one after the other, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said. He said the fatal gunshot came after both <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and Constable 1st Class <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazaga </PERSON> shouted `` Shoot!'' one after the other. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said he identified the voices by comparing voice prints on the tapes with tape-recorded statements made by soldiers during a formal investigation shortly after the murder. A five-member board had required all the soldiers who escorted <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to say those words.

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman and prominent <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser with ties to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been indicted by a federal grand jury in an alleged land fraud. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> of DeSoto, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was accused Tuesday of pocketing $ 5.6 million of $ 8 million he persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> into investing in a condominium project he was developing in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The Mount Pleasant, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, savings and loan was closed in May, when federal regulators said its <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investment and other poorly secured loans had left the company with a negative net worth of $ 65 million. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>, 48, former owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, contributed $ 7,000 to two <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> political committees in 1985. In the fall of 1986, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, then <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, arranged a 2 -LCB- - hour meeting between <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> to air <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>'s complaints about his S & amp; L's treatment by the board <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he was simply encouraging <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to ensure that his agency was being fair to one of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s constituents. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> is accused of using the S & amp; L to finance a `` land flip'' in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, condominium project he was developing in 1982 and 1983. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> bought about 44 acres of land about 11 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> at less than 50 cents per square foot, then sold it the same day through a middleman to 22 buyers at $ 5.25 per square foot, the indictment alleged. He is accused of not telling Capitol Federal officials that he owned the land and planned to sell it to investors at inflated prices. The indictment charges <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> with three counts of wire fraud and one count of making false statements to a federally insured financial institution. `` I am confident that I will be vindicated,'' <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The transaction in the indictment occurred five years ago and all of the funds initially borrowed from Capitol Savings were repaid in 1985.'' No arraignment date has been set for <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>. The S & amp; L industry in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which leads the nation in losses and failures, is the focus of a huge federal criminal investigation that has led to a number of indictments of prominent businessmen. The maximum penalty for wire fraud is a $ 1,000 fine and five years in prison. Making false statements to a federally insured financial institution carries a maximum $ 5,000 fine and two years in prison.

<HEAD>UT Astronomer Finds Light `Echo'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> astronomer has observed the first ghostly light `` echoes'' from Supernova 1987A, an exploding star that lighted the southern skies in February 1987, the university announced. <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crotts </PERSON> made the observations at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campanas </LOCATION> observatory in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the university announced Tuesday. Theories predict that when a supernova explodes, some light from the flash would light up or reflect off dusty clouds of gas and show up as faint arcs of light long after the peak brightness of the supernova. Until now, however, no supernova has been close enough and bright enough to test this prediction, <ORGANIZATION> UT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crotts </PERSON> found two arcs of light corresponding to echoes from supernova 1987A. The echoed light should be that which was emitted when the supernova was at its brightest, some 80 days after the explosion was detected. <PERSON> Crotts </PERSON> said the discovery of the light echo from supernova 1987A was confirmation of a basic prediction on how a supernova should behave. The echo is useful for mapping the clouds of gas and dust that surround the supernova, much as terrain-mapping radar gives information on and contours, <ORGANIZATION> UT </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement announcing the discovery. According to scientists, previously observed supernovae have been so far distant from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> that light echoes were undistinguishable from the source, and the later-arriving light was misinterpreted as slower decay of the supernova.

<HEAD>Dissidents Jailed So They Could Not Take Part In Anti-Government
Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities today announced the release of eight opposition leaders jailed while 10,000 anti-government demonstrators marched through <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s largest street protest since the 1956 uprising. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said writer <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> and the other seven were detained for `` intenting to disturb'' Tuesday's ceremonies commemorating the 140th anniversary of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s rebellion against Austrian After a Communist Party-organized demonstration on Tuesday, the protesters marched down the capital's main boulevards shouting `` Democracy'' and chanting slogans demanding a free press and free elections. Police turned out in force but did not disturb the march. Speakers at a rally after the march criticized the Soviet system. `` The time is over for self-appointed governments,'' leading dissident <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> told the crowd, referring to the nation's Communist authorities. `` A modern democracy has to be created with a new constitution and free elections.'' <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON>, reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> today, said he and the other dissident intellectuals were taken to the <LOCATION> Gyuejtoefoeghaz </LOCATION> prison outside <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, premier during the 1956 revolution, was executed. `` I was picked up by police at 5 a.m. and set free around midnight,'' <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said. `` We were all held in separate cells.'' <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said that, in days preceding Tuesday's anniversary, authorities launched a campaign to try to discourage young people from taking part. In an attempt to keep the number of demonstrators low, he said, police searched houses, seized underground literature and visited high schools, apparently to intimidate students. He said he did not think any of the dissidents detained Tuesday had been fined or charged. The others are sociologist <PERSON> Ottilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>, publisher <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, artist <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jenoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and two lesser known dissidents, <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Racz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Palinkas </PERSON>. On Tuesday, the crowd marched to monuments to national heroes, paying particular tribute to firebrand poet <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Petoefi </PERSON>, whose name is symbolic of resistance to foreign domination of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. A 1948 rebellion in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was put down a year later with the help of Russian troops. In 1956, Soviet troops again helped suppress a nationalist uprising. Hungarian dissidents have staged unofficial demonstrations on March 15 every year since 1973. Police generally have shown restraint, although dozens of officers clashed violently with protesters in 1986. <PERSON> Roza </PERSON> <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, wife of the detained publisher, read her husband's speech to the crowd The Soviet system has led <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into a crisis `` and does not show any way out,'' she said. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> recently has imposed an austerity program to try to reverse economic stagnation.

 A former auto-parts salesman whose collection of orchids was among the world's largest has died, leaving his $ 5 million estate and its nearly 12,000 orchids to the American Orchid Society. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> died Monday at age 92. `` It's just kind of special to see a man's life turned into such beauty and love,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, the city's vice mayor. `` He was our best friend, there's no doubt about it,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, executive director of the society. `` He's going to be very sadly missed.'' <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> and his late wife, <PERSON> Varina </PERSON>, bought their first orchid about 50 years ago. He became a leading amateur grower _ one of the first to develop the yellow phalaenopsis _ and his private collection is among the world's largest. `` Somebody said, ` Try an orchid,' and I bought one in a pot, and the blame thing bloomed.

 Ranchers whose rangeland was devastated by a wildfire that killed about 200 head of cattle are receiving gifts of about 350,000 pounds of hay daily to keep their operations going, officials say. Many cities around the state are conducting hay drives for ranchers affected by the fire, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heirman </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have received a tremendous response to the hay program,'' <PERSON> Heirman </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Today, we received about 100 different donations of hay, with promises of close to 15,000 square bales and 500 to 1,000 round bales.'' The wildfire charred an estimated 350,000 acres of rangeland before it was declared under control Monday afternoon. Weary firefighters who had fought the blaze since last Thursday were sent home Tuesday. A frost helped cool the ground and extinguish the blaze, said <PERSON> Mahlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammetter </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But rain is needed to help rejuvenate the scorched ground, he said. `` We are saving a lot of cattle,'' said <PERSON> Heirman </PERSON>. `` If we can get some rain, we may see them continue to live. Everybody's praying for rain right now.'' About 200 cattle died on 53 ranches in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, he said, and about 500 head were injured. On Monday, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobby </PERSON> issued a disaster proclamation for the region, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> of the governor's Emergency Management Division in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> was out of the state, said the governor's press secretary, <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashur </PERSON>. The fire probably started when flames from burning trash went out of control near <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> last Thursday, authorities said. The fire burned in an area 56 miles long and 24 miles wide in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Throckmorton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> counties.

 Some Israelis are protesting that domestic and foreign journalists covering riots in the occupied lands are producing reports that are pro-Palestinian and damaging to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> has received dozens of threatening letters for its reporting of the more than three months of violent protests in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> _ coverage most foreign journalists consider mild. Even <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has joined in the criticism. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Jersualem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today that television cameras should be barred from the occupied territories. `` Many other nations throughout the world are experiencing troubles similar to those now taking place in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Should <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> be the only nation to allow full television coverage of these troubles?'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> wrote. An American television network says threats have forced it to hire private guards to protect its offices and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cameraman. `` There's an escalation in statements against us,'' <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Fassman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crews </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> this week. `` These criticisms border on incitement to murder.'' There is also growing physical danger in covering the rioting, the managing director of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run television, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavin </PERSON>, said in an interview. He said <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> cameramen have been given a special first aid and self-protection course. They were taught to defend themselves against a mob, make speedy exits and use the camera as a weapon, the daily Hadashot reported. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Amari </PERSON> camp, cameramen were seen Tuesday wearing large tin containers over their heads to protect themselves from stones. Most of the mail that arrives at <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> is critical. `` We are accused of being leftists, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters. There are threatening letters, too,'' said <PERSON> Yavin </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmerman </PERSON>, said at least five or six such letters arrive each day at her office while others go directly to <PERSON> Yavin </PERSON>. The number of letters has not increased since the anti-occupation rioting began Dec. 8, but most are now devoted to patriotic criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s performance in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Many ask why we permit hostile elements to use state-run media for expressing their views,'' Ms. <PERSON> Timmerman </PERSON> said. There are also telephoned complaints. `` If the action gets tough, we get up to 100 calls a night, most from people who say they do n't want to see this or want us to be more favorable to the government,'' said <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, the head of the news department. The TV's Arab-language department faces another kind of threat. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports said its workers have received Palestine Liberation Organization-inspired calls to stop cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities and resign. Department head <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Barel </PERSON> denied the reports. `` People in the territories want coverage, and they know no Arab TV is covering them apart from us,'' he said. Foreign networks are sometimes accused of inflaming violence and unwittingly aiding anti-Israeli rioters. `` The press _ and I'm speaking primarily about the foreign TV networks _ has explicitly been a side involved in the events,'' President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> has said. He said foreign television crews are `` the main weapon'' of the Arabs. He was the latest in a series of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials to criticize foreign media. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and army spokesman Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON> also have spoken out. `` Certain Israeli officials, by their public statements, have created a lynch atmosphere against reporters,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Seamans </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief. The CBS News bureau chief, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Plantinga </PERSON>, said his network hired guards to protect its <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> offices and cameraman <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON> after receiving telephoned threats. Last month, <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON> filmed four Israeli soldiers brutally beating two bound Palestinian youths with rocks in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The broadcast sparked international criticism and the army put the soldiers on trial.

 A jubilant Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> savored a primary victory in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, saying, `` I have been judged by those who know me best'' and talking optimistically today of his chances at a brokered Democratic National Convention. He promptly turned his sights on the next tests _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which holds caucuses on March 26, and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which holds its primary April 5. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> today. He said he hopes to make a respectable showing in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s March 26 caucuses, but said he does not expect to win `` Frankly, I hope we pick up a good chunk of delegates and do respectably, but I do n't anticipate winning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, we're going to have to have some paid media ... and I expect to do well.'' He had predicted repeatedly during his <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign that none of the Democratic candidates would have the nomination wrapped up by the time the party's national convention begins in July, and he said today his victory was evidence to support that prediction. `` The reality is we're going to have to go, we're going to have a wide open convention,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know who out there will emerge, but I think <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has as good a shot as anyone.'' Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said this week that if there is no obvious winner by the end of the primary season party leaders and the candidates should meet and settle on a nominee before the convention. But <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he did n't think much of that idea. `` I would be happy to participate,'' he said. But he added, `` I am doubtful that you're going to emerge with a winner from that kind of operation. ... I'm not saying no to a summit meeting; I'll participate, but I'm not optimistic that it will provide answers. In the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> contest, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> beat out fellow favorite son <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finishing well behind the two leaders. Earlier, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had made it clear that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was a `` must-win'' state for him, saying he would drop out if he did not win both the popular and the delegate vote. He did both. `` This is a new beginning for the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> candidacy,'' he told a packed <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hotel ballroom of cheering supporters Tuesday night. He was interrupted frequently with shouts of `` We Want <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>.'' Even with his victory, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s national delegate total lagged far behind those of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The Associated Press delegate survey showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 464.5 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 460.55 delegates. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 354.8, and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 171.5 delegates. Only Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who was fighting for survival after a poor Super Tuesday showing, trailed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 145. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says his victory in his home state showed there is no clear-cut winner in the Democratic presidential race _ and that means he still has a chance. `` It's not over yet,'' he declared. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> carved up the victories and the votes among them last week on Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> sat out the contests. The senator seemed in good spirits as he cast his ballot at the <LOCATION> Makanda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> along with his wife, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, telling reporters: `` I had no trouble deciding who to vote for.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who was strapped for cash, spent no money on television ads in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary campaign, hoping instead to draw support on the basis of his record. By contrast, rivals <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent heavily _ $ 200,000 for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, $ 250,000 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> openly worried that he could take second place to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> siphoned off enough votes.

The Soviets offered fresh assurances, however, that it would still remove its estimated 115,000 troops two months after a settlement is signed. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 and are helping the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. At issue were <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s demand for a broad-based transitional government to replace the current, Soviet-backed adminsitration in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and for a simultaneous end to military assistance to the warring sides. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> argues that only a government replacing the present administration of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> could guarantee that a peace settlement would be put in place and ensure the safe return of more than 5 million refugees. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where most of the Afghan refugees live, has been representing the guerrilla movement during the U.N.-sponsored talks. The importance of a simultaneous cut-off of superpower military aid has been particularly stressed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It would mean that Soviet aid to its allies in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> would have to end at the same time as aid to the guerrillas who get the bulk of their supplies from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An official Soviet statement issued Tuesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> condemned attempts `` to dictate to the U.S.S.R and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> how they should build their bilateral relations.'' The Soviet statement confirmed, however, that the decision to pull out the troops still stands and that the withdrawal would begin two months after the signing of a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> settlement. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the discussion between <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> dealt mostly with the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> issue. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> had a meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that included a discussion on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but said it is embassy policy not to disclose details of diplomatic exchanges. `` The ambassador's attention was drawn to the Soviet government's statement of March 15, which contains a principled assessment of the unsatisfactory situation at the Afghan-Pakistani talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and also contains a clear-cut qualification of the actions of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which are artifically procrastinating the signing of actually agreed-upon accords,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s stand amounted to a `` unilateral suspension'' and would get the talks nowhere. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> spoke shortly before a new session with U.N. Undersecretary General <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the intermediary in the talks. It was the first meeting since the talks failed to meet the target of March 15 set by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for their conclusion. He charged that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had organized the war which had already led also to `` tragic events'' on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s side. He warned that allowing the conflict to continue would pose a threat to the entire region.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s best week in the 1988 campaign brought seven victories in seven days, but his streak ended with a disappointing second-place finish in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> that highlighted the obstacles he faces in the big-state primaries to come. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew less than 10 percent of the white vote in Tuesday's primary Nevertheless, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today that he has broader support than any other candidate. `` When you get second place in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, you're getting white vote,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` When it's all said and done, it's just Democratic votes. I have the most Democratic votes. I expect to have the most Democratic delegates.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is locked in a tight race with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the lead in the delegate count. `` I'm running No. 1 in popular votes and in delegate votes,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> results were known Tuesday, overstating the delegate situation a bit. `` <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has been good to two favorite sons today. It has also given me the lead for the party.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> easily won the primary. `` If I have the most Democratic votes and I have the most delegates, I will be the nominee. That is my preoccupation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declared. Taking a third of the popular vote in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was close to amassing 3 million votes in the first 20 primaries of 1988. Before the home-state primary, he had trailed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slightly in total primary votes, 2.61 million to 2.57 million. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was winning less than 20 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, boosting his total to just over 2.8 million votes. In delegates before the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> returns, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held the lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but his margin was almost wiped out by the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> returns. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was being shut out in the direct election of delegates in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has proven that he can win votes. And on Super Tuesday he proved he can win state primaries, taking the top spot in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Later in the week he won the caucuses in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and, surprisingly <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The calendar now forces him to prove again that he can win primary victories, this time in states not nearly as friendly to his hopes as those in the past week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s showing in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Tuesday illustrates his problem. He swept the black vote in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and added less than 10 percent of the white vote to put together a second-place finish to fellow favorite son <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> decried any emphasis on the racial division of the vote, saying `` there is a preoccupation with the ethnic breakdown'' of the balloting. But to win in the states to come, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> must do better among the white voters while holding the great bulk of a high-turnout black vote. In the major states holding primaries in the next six weeks _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ there are substantial black populations to give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a core of support. But the relative size of the potential black voting bloc is smaller in each of the coming states than it was in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won his primary victories. And, in the industrial states to come, those black voters are heavily concentrated in a few congressional districts. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will do quite well in the delegate contests there _ as he did in three districts in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ but without substantial white backing in other districts, his delegate count will not add up as fast as his opponents'. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign did n't win any victories in the early going of the presidential season, but he did have some surprisingly powerful showings in states outside his traditional strongholds. He was fourth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. But then he came in a surprising second in the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses on Feb. 23. He was second as well in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses on Feb. 28 and in the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary on March 1. The victory march for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began in the region that was his birthplace, the South. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won five states across the region on March 8, Super Tuesday. On Saturday, he returned to the state of his birth _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ for a big victory in that state's caucuses He then took first place in the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> caucuses. Looking to the upcoming events, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> faces the Illinois problem again. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with its caucuses March 26, about 12 percent of the population is black. But only four congressional districts out of 18 had more than 10 percent black population in the 1980 census. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, only about 7 percent of the population is black, although three of the six congressional districts have substantial minority populations in the March 29 primary. In the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on April 5, the black population is centered in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, adding up to only about 4 percent statewide. In the big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> contest on April 19, about 14 percent of the population is black. And some 13 of the 34 congressional districts have more than 10 percent minority residents. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ with an April 26 primary _ the black population is about 9 percent, heavily concentrated in four of the state's 23 congressional districts.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> will find democratic solutions to the recent ethnic unrest in his country, but he stressed there could be no secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has been critical of some of his predecessors, indirectly attacked former <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> when he referred to <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s break with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1948. The Soviet leader also said the superpowers should reduce their naval forces in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, and he accused <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> of slowing the pace of nuclear disarmament. In his address to the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said ethnic relations are `` one of the most important and delicate issues'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that it would be unnatural to think they were ` once and for all resolved.''' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> itself is an ethnically diverse nation of six republics and two autonomous regions _ <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> _ and is plagued by rising ethnic tensions as the economic situation worsens. There are both `` certain difficulties inherited from the past'' and other `` problems created by the passage of time and the changes in the economic life of society,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He made no mention of riots that killed at least 32 people in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in February, nor of recent mass protests by Armenians demanding the return of a largely Armenian region put under the administration of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. But he said that on ethnic problems, `` We are determined to reach democratic solutions which would correspond to the interest of each and every nation ... and our entire Socialist society.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated, however, there could be no question of secession, saying that each region within Soviet borders has `` indissoluble links'' with the rest of the country. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is comprised of 15 republics. In the Baltic states of the north, some activists want independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s itinerary does not include <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most ethnically troubled area, but he will travel to <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the most developed republic. In a wide-ranging 40-minute speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the 1948 rupture in <LOCATION> Soviet-Yugoslav </LOCATION> relations `` inflicted grave damage on Yugoslav-Soviet relations and ... on socialism as a whole.'' Ties between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> were mended after <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death in 1953, when <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> agreed on bilateral relations in 1955 and 1956 Now, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` both sides are eager to raise our interstate and interparty relations to a new level, to give them a new quality'' and expand ties. A new declaration on Yugoslav-Soviet relations adopted Tuesday is to be published Friday, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> returns home. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also outlined new proposals for <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> security. He enlarged on previous suggestions for reducing the superpowers' naval presence in the waterway by proposing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> freeze the number of warships they have there on July 1. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> should then agree on the number of warships they maintain in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, with the eventual aim being a withdrawal of Soviet ships if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> follows suit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. In addition, he said, the superpowers should give each other advance notice of all ship movements and naval maneuvers in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed that for the Soviets, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> `` is no remote area'' because it is the passage to and from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ports of the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Naturally, we are interested in routes of peace and not those of war passing here,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also attacked what he said were efforts by unidentified politicians in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance to block total nuclear disarmament and to respond to the removal of medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by building up conventional weapons. `` These contradictions, not to say absurdities, have quite definite political convictions behind them,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Such politicians want to paint <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in a bad light at any price, he said. `` They keep harping on the lie of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's war image'' when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is working on `` weeding out for good the Cold War sprouts'' in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said.

 A 10-year-old girl, frustrated in efforts to get information for a class report on <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, flew there for a five-day visit there as a guest of the Southern state. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a fifth grade student at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, was greeted by classmates when she returned Tuesday night to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>.

Her mother, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, said all expenses except plane fare were paid by an anonymous person. The mother said she called the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> secretary of state's office and was told the office was out of reference works She was half-seriously told to send the girl to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` I said, ` great, I will,''' she said. The next morning she got a call from a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> mother who was wiling to take care of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. The girl even met <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> governor. `` He was nice,'' she said. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> said she toured museums, battlefields, mansions and rode a pony. `` There are a lot of museums,'' she said, adding that the favorite part of the trip was a visit to the Impressionist Gallery. `` It had neat stuff in it,'' she said.

 A 128-year-old exclusive private club has admitted its first two black male members but continues to ban women. The two men broke the color barrier at the Olympic Club, where membership costs $ 12,500 plus monthly dues and greens fees. `` I've played golf for years with Olympic members,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, president of a company that makes electronics testing equipment. He said he applied and was interviewed last fall and was accepted last week. `` I'm not a golfer,'' said <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` I joined strictly because of the athletic facilities.

A city ordinance that went into effect in December bars private clubs with more than 400 members from discriminating against minorities and women. However, club spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the ban on women members will remain pending the outcome of a court battle with the city and an appeal to the federal courts on constitutional grounds of freedom of association.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says Its Freighters On Fire After Chinese Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Vietnamese freighters were burning today after Chinese warships attacked them, and Chinese were blocking efforts to rescue the crew, an official Vietnamese broadcast said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said today that some Chinese were wounded in the exchange of gunfire in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The Voice of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> radio said the freighters have been on fire since they were attacked Monday near disputed islands claimed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> calls the islands the <ORGANIZATION> Truong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sa </ORGANIZATION> archipelago. They are known in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Nansha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. They also are called the <LOCATION> Spratly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The broadcast said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuong </PERSON> <PERSON> Vu </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> department of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, made the accusations in a meeting today with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuchin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. `` The Vietnamese side sent lifeboats flying <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> flags to rescue those freighters, but they were obstructed by Chinese warships,'' said the broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. It added: `` The Vietnamese side urged the Chinese side to order its warships to move away from this area and not to prevent the Vietnamese ships from coming to the rescue of the crews on these freighters. The Vietnamese side wishes a favorable and early reply from the Chinese side.'' The broadcast repeated earlier claims that the clash began when the Chinese warships without provocation opened fire on two Vietnamese freighters. It said that warships Nos. 502, 506 and 531 then fired on other Vietnamese freighters that had come to the rescue. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday delivered an official protest to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuchin </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier. The note called the alleged Chinese attack a military provocation and attempt to grab Vietnamese territory. It said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will `` resolutely apply all necessary measures to protect -LRB- its -RRB- independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.'' In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> disclosed today that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had suffered casualties in the skirmish. Ministry spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihua </PERSON> gave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s version of the clash, saying Vietnamese naval ships fired on Chinese vessels conducting a scientific survey on a reef in the chain of 500 uninhabited islands and reefs. `` The Chinese side was forced to make a limited counter-attack in self defense,'' Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> refused to disclose how many Chinese were wounded, whether they were civilians or military personnel, or other details of the clash. Large oil deposits are believed to be in the vicinity of the archipelago, which is more than 310 miles south of <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has stationed troops on a few of the islands since the early 1970s, while <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has troops on a few islands of a second disputed group, the nearby Xisha or Paracels. The clash Monday was the first reported exchange of gunfire between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over the islands, although the two governments periodically have verbal skirmishes. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was an ally of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War but relations cooled after the Communist Vietnamese victory as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> drifted closer into the Soviet orbit. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fought a brief border war in 1979.

<TEXT>
 It seems there are people out there who actually want <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That novel notion may explain why the primary election count is now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 20, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 1. That simplest of explanations is about the only one that has not been advanced by the political sages during the remarkable month-long string of victories that leaves <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the all-but-certain GOP nominee. More popular explanations for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lopsided success run this way: As vice president, he has the benefits of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity His organization is strong, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s is weak. He has the biggest campaign bankroll by far. He has had the support of governors in key states: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Each of those factors certainly helped. In addition, the trappings and status of the vice presidency have so far served <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> well, overcoming the disadvantage No. 2 men always have had in running for the top job _ they ca n't argue with the boss and they must defend what's already in place. But all those elements combined could not produce the kind of landslides <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been gaining unless the vice president had a constituency to call his own, and was strengthening it. Just a month ago today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won his first significant victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, he trounced <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the most credible rival still standing, in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary. Since opening day in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has won just one primary _ in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> _ and caucuses in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and his home state of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. The total popular vote in the 21 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries held so far this year is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 3.3 million, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 1.6 million. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has 772 of the 1,139 delegates needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next Aug. 17. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has 180. All of that has wiped away the memory of embarrassment in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran third to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and the rapidly vanishing <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, and of the week he then spent on the political critical list. Since then he has been winning big, with only minor setbacks. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> complains that the primaries are ending up as a referendum on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, not a contest with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` If I hit him directly, I get <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first and then they say, oh, oh, he's out there attacking <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said. `` It's pretty hard to reach <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> except by phone.'' He found plenty to hit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with earlier in the contest, and he still taunts the vice president as a man who got where he is `` without ever doing much.'' He also calls him a loser. `` Sooner or later, the voters in one of these states are going to say ` Hold it, we're about to nominate a candidate who ca n't win,''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said after losing 16 primaries to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Super Tuesday. But recent polls conducted for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading potential Democratic nominees. Besides, at this point no one can say who's a likely winner in the fall. The tickets are n't known, the issues are n't set, and the odds are subject to wide swings. In fact, the pollsters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailed several of the potential Democratic nominees just before his Super Tuesday sweep. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> camp has not managed to zero in on a state likely to reverse the trend; in contests over the next month the polls point to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Accepting defeat in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which he had said would be his comeback state, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he would keep campaigning. `` We're just going to hang in there,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the pundits thought <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was waiting to see if any of the upcoming Iran-Contra indictments might reflect badly on the vice president. But against a runaway delegate leader, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> does n't have much else to hang in for, nor does he have a limitless bankroll with which to do it. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> argues that it is too early for the competition to end, and says that he has been encouraged by other Republicans, including former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, to stick with the race. That was not one of his themes after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, when there were suggestions that a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> defeat would doom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and trigger a Dole runaway.

 Five explosions erupted today as the coffins of three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed by British troops were being lowered into graves. Thousands of mourners clustered in the Roman Catholic Milltown cemetery in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> flung themselves on the ground as organizers appealed for calm. There were no immediate reports of injuries and it was not clear what caused the explosions. Several mourners grabbed a man evidently suspected of setting the explosions. Hundreds of others rushed from the graveside toward where the explosions took place. The explosions erupted after more than 4,000 mourners had followed the flag-draped coffins of <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, to the cemetery. Several mourners shouted out they believed the explosions were set by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary groups. Police and troops, in an evidently deliberate policy, had kept out of sight during the funerals, which began with a Requiem Mass in a packed parish church, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agnes </LOCATION>. The mourners had followed the coffins, draped in the Irish tricolor, through somber streets, with shops shut, to the cemetery. At the mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agnes </LOCATION>, mourners listened silently as the priest charged that the unarmed trio, ambushed on a bombing mission, were murdered. Shortly before the funeral began, a bomb exploded on a street more than a mile from the church, slightly injuring a British soldier on foot patrol, police reported. Earlier, about 150 mourners watched, with no sign or police or troops, as relatives and members of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, carried the coffin of <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> from his parents' two-story row house to be driven to the church The almost exclusively <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, join it with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and set up an all-Ireland socialist state. In his funeral oration at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Toner </PERSON> called the March 6 shootings in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> `` murder'' and accused British authorities of `` gloating'' over them. More than 1,000 mourners listened in silence broken only by a the crying of a baby. `` We have a mounting, accumulated anger at the treatment of Irish people by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the past weeks and months,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says the guerrillas were shot by commandos while preparing a car bomb attack on the changing of the guard outside the governor's residence in the colony on the southern tip of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The three were unarmed, but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said they made movements that led the soldiers to believe their lives were in danger. The Irish government has complained that the soldiers should have tried to arrest the trio, who the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said were on `` active service.'' Outside the chapel, a crowd of about 3,000 gathered to accompany the coffins to <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION>, the burial ground for many other guerrillas killed in nearly 20 years of sectarian strife which has claimed more than 2,600 lives. In the tense buildup to the funerals, Protestants stoned hearses that brought the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bodies home Tuesday on a 100-mile route from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. The coffins had been flown from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on a plane chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. Hooded <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen fired a three-shot volley, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional salute to guerrillas killed in its bomb and bullet campaign against British rule, to coincide with the arrival of the coffins on Irish soil Two Catholics, including <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, 33, shot by British troops near <LOCATION> Savage </LOCATION>'s home on Monday, were fatally wounded in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> over the past two days. Another Catholic, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrillan </PERSON>, died when unidentified gunmen opened fire as he arrived for work Tuesday. Police said they suspected a sectarian attack by Protestant militants.

<TEXT>
 Fallen television evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has sued a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who formerly represented the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, charging that the attorney tricked him into resigning and turning the ministry over to the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. In the suit, which seeks more than $ 10,000 in damages and was filed this week in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, say they did not know that <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> also represented <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> when he advised the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> to step down. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> are really saying in the lawsuit is that Mr. <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> tricked the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> into resigning from office to open the way for Mr. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> to take over the leadership of the ministry,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' attorneys. <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> said Tuesday the allegations were `` utterly meritless,'' adding that he was never <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney. `` I did n't tell him to resign. He made that decision,'' <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the Fort Mill-based ministry last March amid a sex scandal involving a church secretary, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> took over the ministry for several months. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> now is undergoing reorganization in bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>, according to the suit, that television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, now beset by a sex scandal himself, was heading a conspiracy to take over <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> claim that <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> advised them to `` turn the leadership of the ministry over to Mr. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who, it was said, would lead the ministry as a caretaker until such time as the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- could return to the ministry,'' the suit said. The suit also charged that `` <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> either knew or should have known that the alleged conspiracy to seize control of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> by Mr. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, either was not truthfully reported or was impractical of attainment.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> president on March 19; a month later, <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> took the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> off the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> payroll. The suit said the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> `` severely damaged financially and diminished as a Christian ministry'' and accused <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> of giving the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> incorrect advice to resign, resulting in damage to the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' reputations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The sister of the longest-held American hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said today that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, once obsessed with securing freedom for the captives, no longer cares about their fate. `` I think it's rather interesting to look back and see the concern expressed by the administration, by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and their rationale for the Iran-Contra scandal that they were so obsessed with the fate of the hostages that they made this move,'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, sister of hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said of the arms-for-hostages deal. `` And for the past year, silence. That obsession seems to have been overcome and the fate of the hostages no longer seems to be of great concern to anybody in this administration,'' she said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as he was returning from a tennis game. Services to mark the third anniversary of his abduction were scheduled in <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was taking part at an afternoon service at Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church where prayers for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the other hostages were to be offered by Christian and <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> clergy.

Ms. <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> said, however, that she feared the captives have been forgotten by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` I feel they've been put on the backburner, that the concern for the hostages _ I do n't know if there is any any more,'' Ms. <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> program. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986.

<HEAD>FAA Looks Into Testing Procedures at Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is investigating <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' pilot testing procedures following comments made last week at a hearing into a November crash that killed 28 people, officials said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaudette </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s air transportation division in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that the investigation was set off by one pilot's report that he made deliberate mistakes in wing settings to test pilots. `` I ca n't see how they could safely do that in passenger-carrying operations,'' <PERSON> Beaudette </PERSON> said. Federal regulations prohibit pilot training on flights that carry passengers. The inquiry follows testimony by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> last week before a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing into the Nov. 15 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 that killed 28 and injured 54 as it was taking off from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s airport. On a flight last October, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said he made incorrect adjustments to an aircraft before takeoff in order to test pilot <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON>, who died in the November crash. `` As is my common practice, I advised <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> that I would intentionally make several mistakes,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> told the hearing. `` I intentionally misset flaps, -LRB- stabilizer -RRB- trim and weight cards for takeoff. He caught and corrected me on them,'' he said. If a violation is found, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> could be issued an administrative warning, fined, or <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s license could be suspended, <PERSON> Beaudette </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said the procedure <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> reported using is not a company policy. But <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said he did n't know whether the technique has been used by other <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots and said the airline has not yet decided whether to permit that kind of pilot testing in the future.

Also today, foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to discuss the 7-year-old Iran-Iraq war and its implications for the oil-rich region. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of wasting time on an arms embargo instead of ending the missile duel, in which scores of civilians have been killed or wounded. In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the prestigious newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zuercher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> today quoted senior Iranian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> as saying his country had cut all ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> also was quoted as saying only a military solution could end the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> no longer felt obligated to respect international conventions, presumably including the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention on the conduct of nations at war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Tuesday reiterated the claim that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke a two-day truce in the `` war of the cities'' and said it would continue to attack <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stopped shelling border cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said warplanes Tuesday night bombed Iranian towns and attacked a ship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Maritime sources had earlier reported an Iraqi attack at around the same time on the 249,223-ton Trade Fortitude. The Iranian agency said Revolutionary Guards fired five missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in retaliation for an air raid Tuesday that killed 25 students and teachers at a high school in al-Eshtar in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iraqi agency confirmed three of the hits on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and said `` many'' civilians were killed. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired seven missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said an unspecified number of missiles hit the capital of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today and said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes also bombed <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION> and other cities in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iranian agency said a total of 52 civilians were killed. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it has fired 22 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since the tenuous truce broke down late Sunday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has reported launching seven into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Neither side has given an overall casualty count. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s news agency said Iranian jet fighters bombed the northern <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil city of <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> and other cities today, `` inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy.'' It said the jet fighters also shot 16 air-to-ground missiles into <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION>. It said nine short-range missiles were fired into the southern <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> province, the area surrounding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. It said Revolutionary Guards pushed farther into <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> province in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, inflicting `` heavy losses.'' Earlier in the week <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its fighters seized villages and hills in the region, 160 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Iranian forces took the town of <LOCATION> Khurmal </LOCATION> a few miles from the border after a `` pitched battle,'' the agency reported today. It said residents of `` liberated villages'' in the area `` warmly welcomed the attacking Iranian combatants,'' and Iranian forces seized 95 square miles of Iraqi soil, including 21 villages. Announcing today's Iraqi missile strike on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, an Iraqi military spokesman was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as saying: `` We will continue our destructive hits into the nest of vice and ugliness.'' It also said Revolutionary Guards pushed farther into <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> province in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, inflicting `` heavy losses'' and that <PERSON> Khurmal </PERSON> had fallen. Earlier in the week, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its fighters seized villages and hills in the region 160 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The Iraqi and Iranian reports were monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The attack Tuesday on the Trade Fortitude raised the possibility of revived attacks on shipping in the gulf, where the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker <PERSON> Gas </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> was heading north in the 17th U.S.-escorted convoy this year. Since Feb. 15, there have been two confirmed Iraqi attacks on tankers in Iranian shipping lanes.

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will become an oil exporter for the first time because of new discoveries, officials said today. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Audu </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> countries, said that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> produced 240,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter of last year.

 Like an electronic sneeze, a rogue computer program known as a `` virus'' has spread to a major software company's commercial programs, a frightening `` infection'' that the experts once thought was impossible. On March 2, a `` message of peace'' created by the publisher of a Canadian computer magazine appeared on as many as 350,000 Macintosh computer screens in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, apparently spread like an epidemic through the network of electronic bulletin boards' free or low-cost software The message became the first known contamination of an off-the-shelf program when it cropped up in FreeHand, <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s latest software, forcing the company to recall or rework about 5,000 copies of the program It `` was a very benign incident,'' but <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> officials `` are talking with our attorneys to understand what our legal rights are in this instance,'' said <PERSON> Laury </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Seattle-based software company. Viruses are small, secret programs created by programmers as jokes or acts of vandalism, then secretly inserted into other programs. Viruses can spread from computer to computer by operators sharing `` contaminated'' software. At their most benign, viruses will cause only a message to pop up on a computer screen, as apparently happened here. At their worst, as `` tapeworms'' or `` logic bombs,'' they can destroy information stored in computer memories. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> of the Montreal-based computer magazine <ORGANIZATION> MacMag </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview Tuesday that he wrote the virus, but intended only to show the dangers of software piracy, or unauthorized copying. The full message, said <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON>, read: `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON>, the publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff would like to take this opportunity to convey their universal message of peace to all Macintosh users around the world.'' Beneath that was a graphic of the globe. Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said fewer than 5,000 copies of FreeHand were contaminated by a an infected disk that was copied for three days by a disk duplicating machine, and only half the infected disks were distributed to retailers. Until now, personal computer viruses were thought to reside only in noncommercial `` freeware'' or `` shareware'' legally distributed on computerized bulletin boards or on software disks shared by computer users. Experts had thought viruses could be avoided if users did n't freely distribute software, but only used off-the-shelf programs The incident rocked the computer industry because the nation's three largest software companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ are clients of <ORGANIZATION> MacroMind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the company that inadvertently gave the virus to <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> declined comment, but officials at <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> said none of their software was infected. MacroMind President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday that to the best of his knowledge, none of his other customers received the virus and that the program has erased itself. Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> said the virus died out after March 2, the anniversary of the introduction of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s Macintosh SE and Macintosh II models. <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said the peace message apparently was in software he obtained from <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The packet included a game program called Mr. Potato Head, a computerized version of the popular toy. Unaware of the `` infection,'' <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> ran the game program once and then used the same computer to work on a disk to teach Macintosh users how to use FreeHand. That original disk became infected, and then contaminated other FreeHand teaching disks when it was copied by <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Canter </PERSON>, upset with <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON>, also said he was considering legal action. <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Canter </PERSON>, but denied giving him the software. <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> said the idea for the message program was written and tested for a year, then left for two days in December on a Macintosh at MacMag's offices, a frequent gathering place for Macintosh devotees. The publisher said he expected pirated programs from the machine would spread the peace message in the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> area and a few other areas of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Instead, he said, he was shocked to find that, by his estimate, 350,000 people in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had the message pop up on their Macintoshes on March 2.

 A couple collecting aluminum cans found the remains of the sixth body discovered in the desert since last fall, and police said they needed an autopsy to determine the victim's age, sex and cause of death. However, Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said Tuesday the discovery of the exposed, bleached bones on the outskirts of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> was n't cause for panic The sixth body was found Monday afternoon northeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, a few hundred yards from where the bodies of five young women were unearthed. No one has been charged in the desert deaths, which police have said could be the work of a serial killer. However, police have identified a suspect who has been jailed on unrelated sexual assault charges since Oct. 14. Police took two days to unearth the latest skeletal remains, sifting buckets of excavated dirt. Scagno would not comment on whether clothing or a weapon was found at the scene. `` The only detail we're going to tell you is ... the body had -LRB- dental -RRB- braces,'' <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said. `` The body itself is just skeletal remains.'' Skeletons were all that remained of the first five victims. <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said he did n't know when the autopsy results would be released. The search for the desert killer began in September, when a utility company employee found the first body while digging a hole near several highways. Although police concluded their search of the area in January, <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said they now plan to start looking again. The remains of <ORGANIZATION> Maria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casio </ORGANIZATION>, 24, and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 20, were found buried close together Sept. 4. The bodies of <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 14, were found Oct. 20, about 200 yards from the first two bodies. The body of <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Frausto </PERSON>, 17, was found Nov. 3, between the first two pairs of graves. Ms. <PERSON> Casio </PERSON>, from a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb, had been here visiting a relative when she disappeared.

<HEAD>New INS Policy To Accept Misdemeanor Convicts For Amnesty,
Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Undocumented aliens seeking amnesty despite misdemeanor criminal records may be eligible if the convictions are more than a year old, a newspaper reported today. But amnesty rights activists said the proposed change in immigration-law standards comes too late. `` Immigration has been very lax in coming forward to publicize this major change,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>, director of a legalization appeals project for the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Under the existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy, immigrants who have been convicted of three or more misdemeanors, or any felony, are not eligible for amnesty. The proposed change would allow immigrants to expunge misdemeanors from their records and be eligible for amnesty, according to a report published today in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Examner </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> estimated that thousands of people, many of whom have been told by officials that they were n't eligible for legalization, would be affected by the reported policy shift. But <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, disagreed. `` I do n't think this would dramatically affect the numbers of people in the program,'' he said. In a letter dated Jan. 18, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> western region processing facility for amnesty applications, explained to an immigrants' rights attorney that `` an expungement will not remove ineligibility for criminal convictions.'' However, attorneys from the immigration committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Public Defender's office said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is now accepting expungements, though too late to be of use to many immigrants. The amnesty deadline is May 5, and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, a deputy <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public defender, said it takes a month or longer to get an expungement.

 The Democrats are searching anew for a presidential front-runner after the home-state revival of Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who declared today he has `` as good a shot as anybody'' after his victory over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won easily in the Republican contest, although he still had to contend with a battered but dogged <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The candidates went on spring break today after a grueling month that featured 20-odd primaries and caucuses in both parties. `` This is the state, it will be remembered, which locked it up for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said after <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> shattered <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s comeback bid and brought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> two-thirds of the way to a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominating majority. The Democrats had no luxury to talk of locking up anything. The race for a nominating majority of delegates was a dead heat between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> next up on the calendar. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was expecting to pick up about 100 uncounted delegates from caucuses already held in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` Now we move on to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` where there are no favorite sons. The field is wide open.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> today, congratulated <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> on his victory but in almost the same breath seemed to dismiss it as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters paying `` respects to a sitting senator'' who had focused on his home state while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was competing in the Super Tuesday states. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, on the other hand, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> that his <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> win showed he is in the thick of a battle that will go all the way to the Democratic National Convention this summer. `` I do n't know who out there will emerge, but I think <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has as good a shot as anyone,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in several interviews that his relative lack of campaign money was n't a big problem, though he concluded his appearance on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> by saying with a smile, `` Any of your viewers who want to send in a contribution, I'll be happy to accept it.'' `` I do n't believe we have any front-runners,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after finishing what he described as `` a respectable third'' in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He said in his discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders around the country `` there is an overwhelming sentiment that we should get behind a nominee.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished second in the duel of favorite sons, and said, `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in popular vote and delegates, is on top of the race.'' In fact, the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate survey showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 464.5 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 460.55. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had 354.8; Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 145, and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 171.5 delegates. The big losers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> were Republicans <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Democrats <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` We're staying in,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> after absorbing another beating at the hands of the vice president. `` <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has spoken loud and clear and strong,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who now has won 18 straight primaries _ 16 of them one week ago on Super Tuesday. There was relatively little campaign activity today, after five frantic weeks in which nearly half the delegates to the Democratic and Republican conventions were chosen. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had an appearance scheduled in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but the rest of the candidates were off the campaign trail. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Democrats hold caucuses this weekend and both parties have primaries scheduled Saturday in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Next Tuesday, the only event in the presidential struggle is a primary to select the seven delegates allocated to Democrats abroad. The next major battleground for the Democrats was <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which holds party caucuses on March 26. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> made little effort in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, pinning his hopes on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with its strong union vote. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spent about $ 200,000 on advertising in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and ended up with only 5 percent of the vote. Yet, he insisted, there would be better days ahead. `` This race has a long way to run yet,'' said the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator. For the Republicans, the next big test was <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, with a primary on March 29. That should produce another big win for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who grew up in the state, which his father represented in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. There were two presidential votes in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ a non-binding popularity contest and the election of convention delegates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> were the big winners in both. With nearly all the votes counted, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was getting about 54 percent of the popular vote and winning 66 delegates. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was receiving 36 percent of the vote, and winning 16 delegates. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was getting 7 percent of the vote and no delegates. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, running stronger than expected, was getting 43 percent of the popular vote and picking up 136 delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was receiving 31 percent of the vote and 37 delegates, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was getting 17 percent of the vote, but no delegates. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> trailed with 5 percent and 2 percent of the vote respectively, and no delegates. Good news for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came from far-away <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, where Democratic officials released results from 65 percent of their March 8 caucuses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led with 45 percent of the vote, to 35 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 14 percent uncommitted. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 4 percent. Overall, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will send 65 delegates to the national convention. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he'd have to reassess his candidacy _ the political euphemism for preparing to drop out _ if he got less than 5 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He got 7 percent, but has stopped talking about being the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> declared, `` This is a new beginning for the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> candidacy.''

 Lawyers for the `` Sharpeville Six'' today filed an appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a stay of execution for the six blacks, whose scheduled hangings have prompted worldwide cries for clemency. Attorney <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> filed the request on the basis of new evidence relating to allegations that police assaulted and pressured a state witness into giving false evidence against two of the defendants. The hearing was scheduled for Thursday morning. The executions are scheduled at dawn Friday at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Central Prison. A finding of new evidence is the only grounds available to stop the hangings, since President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Tuesday he had turned down the last appeal to save the five men and one woman.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with another <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary victory under his belt, celebrated his `` great and convincing'' win in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, while backers proclaimed he has the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination sewed up. `` This is the state, it will be remembered, which locked it up for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' four-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state chairman and campaigned with him all over <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` Who says nice guys finish last?'' a buoyant <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked supporters at a victory celebration in this northwest <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` Thank you, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' he said. The vice president was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today for a campaign hiatus. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> resoundingly beat his nearest rival, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> ran a distant third with 7 percent. `` <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has spoken loud and clear and strong, and so now we go on, right down to the wire in November, and with your help we'll win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in November,'' he told supporters who waved red, white and blue balloons and chanted `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'88.

<HEAD>Kremlin Adviser Says He Warned Soviets About Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prominent Soviet adviser warned the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> less than a month after Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that the action would derail efforts to curb the arms race, he said in a letter published today. Economist <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> said he sent a report in 1979 to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo that outlined the potential dangers to Soviet foreign policy and public opinion. `` In a situation report delivered to the appropriate levels on Jan. 20, 1980, the hopeless and detrimental aspects of that action were stated,'' <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> wrote in a letter published in the weekly Literary Gazette. <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> has been head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> for nearly 20 years and is a respected adviser on development in Kremlin-allied nations. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow leadership with another and to back it against an anti-communist Moslem insurgency. An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to support the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government now headed by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. The Soviets have said they will withdraw their troops if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which represents the Afghan rebels, agrees to a peace proposal with <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The two sides have been meeting for U.N.-sponsored peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` For the first time since World War II emerged the possibility of a military conflict in which, unlike in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, we would have to fight with our own troops,'' <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> quoted his report as saying. `` The report stated that as a result of that action detente was blocked and political efforts to limit the arms race were liquidated,'' <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> wrote. `` There occurred a considerable consolidation of the anti-Soviet front in governments surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> from the West to the East.'' The intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> damaged <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> relations with developing countries, especially in Moslem nations, the economic theorist said he warned in the report. The letter gave no indication what, if any, response <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> received from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership.

<HEAD>Inquest Finds Theologian Killed Self After Writing Critical Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> theologian committed suicide after writing a controversial article accusing the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> of weakness and indecision, a coroner ruled today. The Rev. <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a traditionalist figure in the church, wrote the traditionally unsigned preface to `` Crockford's Clerical Directory 1987-88,'' the church's own reference book listing Anglican clergy. The article, published Dec. 2, started a furor in the state church because it was widely interpreted as the opening shot in a campaign to pressure Archbishop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, 66, into retiring early and to block the appointment of a liberal to replace him. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is spiritual head of the church and the world's 70 million Anglicans. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 58, wrote in a diary four days before his Dec. 7 death that `` I should be lucky to weather this business through without disaster.'' He was found dead in his fume-filled car at his home in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had purchased a hose pipe on Dec. 5 that was used to siphon fumes into his car from the exhaust, the inquest heard. <LOCATION> Oxfordshire </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said the tenor of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s diary entries `` changes dramatically in the last few days of his life'' and there was ample evidence to suggest <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was under extreme pressure. `` He decided that he had only one course of action open to him and took that course of action fully aware of what the results would be,'' <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said. `` Accordingly, my verdict must be that he took his own life.''

<HEAD>Negligence Causes 11,700 Deaths in 3-Year Period</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Negligence and dereliction of duty have caused the deaths of 11,700 people over the past three years, a top Chinese official was quoted today as saying. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procuratorate </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's top prosecutor's office. He was not identified by name. The official said accidents resulting from `` rampant bureaucratic bunglings'' and negligence cost the state $ 378 million in direct economic losses over the same period. He said there had been an unexpected rise in the number of serious cases of negligence involving criminal liability over the past two years. He gave no reason for the increase. Previous reports have linked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s serious problem with industrial accidents to both inept bureaucracy and economic reforms which have decentralized industry and encouraged the establishment of hundreds of thousands of small, often poorly regulated factories. The official said most criminal cases are in the fields of construction, mining and transport, forcing the resignation of several senior government leaders. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was forced from office last year because of his poor handling of a disastrous forest fire and the railways minister stepped down earlier this month to take the blame for three fatal train accidents in January. The official said the procuratorate will impose stricter punishment for people who have committed crimes of derelection or have caused major accidents due to negligence of duty. Organizations caught trying to cover up such crimes or which delay reporting them will also face severe criminal punishment, he said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> today held the first such high-level military talks in an atmosphere characterized as friendly and non-pressured. `` The tone has been very positive and cooperative throughout,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` We are pleased with the way things are going.'' The two discussed the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, implementation of the treaty to eliminate medium-range superpower nuclear missiles, and the size of the respective armed forces, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. They also discussed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that the Soviets violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty by building a phased-array radar far from the Soviet border in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The pact requires such radars to be along the border. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> declined to give full details of the talks, saying that <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> reserved that right for news conferences both plan at the end of the talks Thursday. Opening the morning session at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> `` commented that the room ... was a very small room, and said there is a saying in Russian that although we have close quarters, we should n't quarrel.'' `` Everyone got a laugh out of that,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` The main point that Mr. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> made in the beginning was that he wanted to have useful discussions without having the pressure of negotiations ... to arrive at some sort of agreement,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> to the opening round. Inside, the two men, flanked by about 10 aides apiece, faced each other across a long table at the end of which stood a relief map of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the area defended by the opposing forces of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. The two men exchanged greetings, but made no public remarks. It was the first ever business meeting between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet defense secretaries. Reporters and photographers were ushered out of the room as the first, three-hour session began. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> ate lunch at the residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador Faith <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittlesey </PERSON> before the afternoon session at the Soviet embassy. On Thursday, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> were to eat breakfast at the residence of Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Zoya </PERSON> <PERSON> Novozhilova </PERSON> before their third and concluding session. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told reporters earlier that he hoped <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> could give him concrete evidence of a highly publicized new Soviet military doctrine. Despite extensive Soviet press commentary on the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> doctrine of reasonable or defensive sufficiency, he said he had seen seen `` absolutely no practical change.'' `` If anything, their military continues to grow. They continue to modernize,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said before he left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he hoped for `` frank, constructive discussion'' on arms control issues including strategic arms, nuclear testing, chemical and conventional weapons. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> emphasized that he did not want the meeting to open a `` parallel channel'' to on-going superpower arms negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Soviet journalists covering the session said they had been told it was likely to produce no dramatic announcements, but to serve as an `` impulse'' to other negotiations.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Gorbachev's Speech to Yugoslav Parliament</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech Wednesday to the Yugoslav Parliament: `` We will have to thoroughly examine the question of improving inter-nationality relations, one of the most important and delicate issues in a multinational country such as ours. Basic positions here are firm. `` Recently, when the 70th anniversary of the Great October Revolution was formally celebrated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, we spoke with a justified sense of gratification of the results of the Leninist nationalities policy of how much had been done in the country to upgrade the economy and culture of the many peoples inhabiting our land, so that they might live in friendship and accord. `` Whatever constituent or autonomous republic or region we take, it is now bound by thousands of threads to all other parts of the sountry, and it has indisoluble links within the integrated economic and political complex ... It would be a mistake, however, to regard the life of nations and relations of nations as something settled once and for all. `` There are certain difficulties inherited from the past. There are problems that emerged in the course of time prompted by changes in economic life and social relationships and in the consciousness of people. `` We are determined to secure democratic solutions to these problems which would correspond to the interests of each and every nation and in the family of Soviet nations and our entire socialist society. `` I should like to stress that the changes in our society are closely linked with the activity of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the initiator of perestroika -LRB- change -RRB-. In the current crucial stage, its role as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people's political vanguard is particularly great. And we are convinced that the party can carry out the current responsible tasks it is confronted with, not by methods of command and administration, but by putting itself at the head of the mass movement for a revolutionary renewal of society, and by consolidating two-way connections with the working class, the farmers, the intelligentsia and all social strata.'' `` We are implementing our perestroika in keeping with the conditions and needs of our own country, and we have no intention whatsoever to palm it off as a universal model or recipe that would be good for all. `` Today, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> is one of the most explosive regions of the world, an intricate knot of conflicting interests abounding in huge military arsenals which are continuing to grow. There is no other enclosed sea with the same concentration of naval forces. `` For us, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> base is no remote, out-of-the-way area. It is close to our southern borders, and it is crossed by the only sea route linking our southern ports with the world's oceans. `` Naturally, we are interested in routes of peace, rather than those of war, passing here. In this connection, I would like to declare that we fully support the program of security measures advanced by the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> nonaligned states at their -LRB- <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> -RRB- meeting. It is a sound basis for broad and fruitful dialogue on the problems of the region. `` Along with the earlier Soviet proposals to reduce military potential in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> area, we would like to advance additional proposals for consideration to the international community. `` Reaffirming our readiness to withdraw the Soviet naval forces along with those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. We suggest that this should not be put off indefinitely ... and that as a first step, the number of ships in the two countries' naval potential here should be frozen as from July 1 this year. Thereafter, ceilings would be set for them. `` Second, even before general confidence-building measures are agreed upon in the spirit of the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> accords, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could give each other and all the other <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> countries advance notice of any redistribution of warships and of naval exercises. They could also invite observers to them. `` Third, our country will fully support the elaboration by <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and other interested countries of principles and methods assuring the security of intensive shipping, especially in international straits.''

 The five Democratic presidential contenders all made it out of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> alive, with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declaring today that `` <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters were quite generous to both favorite sons'' and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> claiming momentum for the primaries still to come. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s victory over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has rendered talk of a nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner meaningless and given new boost to discussion of a brokered national convention next summer. Both <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today that they would participate if <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> called a summit to close ranks behind a probable nominee if no one emerged from the primaries with enough delegates to win. But <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` I am not optimistic that it will provide answers.'' He said that after his victory in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, `` I think I'm going to do well'' in the contests yet to come. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was `` back in the race.'' `` The field is wide open,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the national leader in delegates but a third-place finisher in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` We're about halfway home. All sorts of things can happen,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, a non-candidate, said Tuesday night in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> marked a turning point in the nominating calendar, out of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and into the Northern and Midwestern states. After <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses on Saturday -LRB- 138 delegates -RRB-, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> -LRB- 81 -RRB-, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- 255 -RRB- and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> -LRB- 178 -RRB- all cast their votes in primaries over a six-week period. Winners and losers alike hailed the results of Tuesday's primary that gave <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> the gift of political life and elevated fellow-favorite son <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to within a few votes of wresting the national delegate lead from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, is expecting to reap some 100 delegates from uncounted caucuses already held in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` This is a new beginning for the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> candidacy,'' said the senator as he celebrated his triumph. `` I intend to do well in succeeding states.'' `` I think I will do respectably well in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> I think I will do very well.'' In a dig at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` spent more than $ 500,000 and did n't wind up with a single delegate.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has his own vulnerability of course; he could n't win next-door <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and bypassed the entire South and more on Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I finished second, it seems in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' But he took a look at the overall popular vote for the states to hold primaries and caucuses thus far and said, `` I'm a winner. I am the leading contender for the Democratic nomination. I am where every candidate wishes he could be tonight.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is hoping to maneuver around <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> _ one of the few prominent black officials to endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or any other non-Jackson Democrat _ to build his <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> support. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the leader in delegates nationwide, finished a distant third in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He failed in a $ 250,000 advertising campaign designed to siphon off enough of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s white support to drop the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator into second place and force his withdrawal from the campaign. `` I do n't get disappointed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We did what I characterize as a respectable third.'' He added, `` Now we move on to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> where there are no favorite sons.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has several dozen staff aides in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and is counting on the friendship of Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union president <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> to aid his cause. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> finished fourth in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and aides said despite his strong Super Tuesday showing a week ago, he has yet to decide where to concentrate his efforts in the North and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` The outcome means that this race is even more wide open than ever before,'' said the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was last in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and went to bed without talking to reporters. But he was first on the air with television commercials in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in what aides said was a make-or-break contest for him. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> hopes his appeal for tougher trade policies will appeal to the state's large unionized automobile labor force and is counting on picking up agricultural support as well. `` I feel we did as well as we could in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. I just did n't feel it was worth the effort to go in and put in a lot of resources to get votes in their favorite-son situation,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> `` The race is wide open. It has been right along. I think if I can get a good result in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which I think I can, I'm going to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great chance to be the nominee,'' he said. Said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>: `` The outcome means this race is even more wide open than ever before ... The results ... make it more likely we will go to a second ballot'' before picking a winner at the convention. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the best-financed and best-organized contender, shuddered at the talk. `` I've been making a number of calls around the country to key Democrats and there is an overwhelming sentiment that we should get behind a nominee.''

 Relatives and close friends attended memorial services today for 17 soldiers killed last week in the collision of two helicopters during a night training exercise. Soldiers and dignitaries, including Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, filled the 450-seat main post chapel. An opened Bible rested on a simple altar. `` I have flown personally with each of these men. I can tell you without reservation that they truly loved what they were doing,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fucci </PERSON>, commander of the 101st Aviation Regiment's 5th Brigade. `` We all share in the loss of these men. And though all the grief that we feel does not begin to compare with the sorrow being felt by their wives and their families, our hearts and our prayers go out to you.'' Seven aviation flight helmets mounted atop sabers and M-16 assault rifles standing next to seven pair of boots to represent those victims from the fort's aviation brigade. `` Over the last week we have expressed our sympathies to families, friends and fellow soldiers with our heads down, unable to find the right words, if any at all, and an emptiness felt within,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozorski </PERSON>, Sr, acting commander of the aviation regiment's 1st Battalion. One service was held for members of the <ORGANIZATION> 101st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, a second for members of the 502nd Infantry Regiment. Both units lost members in the crash. Thirteen infantrymen and helicopter crew members died when their craft, returning to <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION> from a night training exercise in a formation with two other helicopters, was struck broadside by a second copter on a separate mission, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said. All four soldiers on the second craft also died, in what the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said was its worst aviation accident since 248 <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION> servicemen were killed in a jet crash in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1985. The two other helicopters flying in formation were not damaged and landed safely. An investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was to finish its work at the crash scene six miles from the airfield by Friday and reconvene at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, officials said. The safety center's report on the accident is expected within three months. One crash investigator has said initial findings indicated that `` human and environmental factors'' _ and not mechanical failure _ were suspected as responsible for the collision.

 The body buried in the police chief's front yard turned out to be that of his wife's former husband, and now authorities are trying to find out how the man died and how the body ended up where it did. State pathologist Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON> was to continue an autopsy today, according to <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Swope </PERSON>, senior assistant attorney general. Dental records identified the remains as those of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> said Tuesday. Bean disappeared 10 years ago; his wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, married the police chief, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a year after Bean's disappearance.

 A panel of theologians has ruled the unexplained healing of a youth's hearing impairment was a miracle attributed to <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>, advancing efforts to have the heiress-turned-nun declared a Roman Catholic saint. The panel's decision will be reviewed by the 19 cardinals of the Congregation for the <ORGANIZATION> Causes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>, which will take up the case after Easter and recommend any further action to Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. A group of doctors said in December they could find no medical explanation for the healing in 1974 of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutherman </PERSON>, now 28, of <LOCATION> Bensalem </LOCATION>, after an infection had destroyed the hearing in his right ear. He regained hearing after his family and members of the order Miss <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> founded, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, prayed for her intervention. Miss <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>, who died in 1955 at the age of 96, was declared `` venerable'' on Jan. 26, 1987. If the theologians' decision is upheld by the cardinals and the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> concurs, she would be declared `` blessed,'' the final step before sainthood. Before she could be declared a saint, a second miracle would have to be credited to her. Miss <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in 1891 and gave $ 20 million toward helping blacks and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am elated,'' said Sister <PERSON> Faith </PERSON> <PERSON> Okerson </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> Heights-based order. `` It's a real gift to us and our nation.''

 Israeli police today detained an Arab-American peace activist and a Palestinian was killed in clashes with troops in the occupied territories, where <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> banned travel and long-distance phone calls. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s move Tuesday to cut telephone links between foreign countries and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and to ban travel by Palestinians in the occupied territories. The restrictions were aimed at hampering <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> activists, whom <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> blames for keeping alive unrest that has claimed 97 Arab lives since Dec. 8. The army said one Palestinian died and six were wounded in protests near <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The army said the circumstances of the death were under investigation and that no other details were available. The Arab-owned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified the victim as 60-year-old <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehyeh </PERSON> and said he died after soldiers threw tear gas into his home in a refugee camp on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded eight Palestinians, six of them in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and two in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Arab-American <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, was being held at a city police station after he was arrested for attending an illegal gathering, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the illegal gathering took place on the main road between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, but he had no further details. Last year, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials confiscated <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s Israeli identity card and ordered him out of the country in November, when his three-month tourist visa expired. On Monday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to show within 60 days why <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> had not been expelled. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a Palestinian who also has homes both in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, came under fire after the publication in Hebrew of his book entitled `` Non-Violent Resistance: A Strategy For the Occupied Territories.'' The book urged the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to refuse to pay taxes, lay down in front of bulldozers to prevent land confiscation and boycott Isreli products. In other developments, a PLO-ordered general strike entered its second day today, keeping most Arab workers from their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told high school students that nightly curfews in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> were necessary to `` reduce their -LRB- the Arab activists' -RRB- capability to move by night, to prepare explosives ... to obstruct roads that carry workers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' According to army estimates, about 2,600 Palestinians have been arrested on riot-related charges, most for throwing stones. The telephone and travel restrictions have a two-fold purpose: to demonstrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s determination to regain control of the streets and to keep <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists from receiving telephone instructions from abroad or from moving freely between the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the territories in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The ban on direct-dial overseas telephone calls was not likely to be completely effective, however, since it excluded <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighborhoods in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where 130,000 Palestinians live. The army-run territorial government will lift restrictions when authorities feel a change and the situation calms, informed sources said. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also held out the possibility other steps would be taken, including the closing of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> bridges to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The bridges are an avenue for trade and travel, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials estimate more than 1 million people cross annually. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper today said authorities were considering cutting off electricity to some areas, banning export of some products and closing markets. In recent days, the focus of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> campaign has shifted from street confrontations to civil disobedience, such as the resignations of Arab police and tax collectors. Israeli authorities each day this week have imposed new restrictions on Palestinians.

 <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> was the fast-talking tough guy, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> his drawling partner with homespun common sense as they rode into town to fight for a principle _ only this time it was real life, not a movie. The two <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> legends began a two-day whirl of lobbying in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and on television talk shows Tuesday to plead for the preservation of their film classics against modern moguls out to `` make a buck.'' <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> shook his finger at a packed room of reporters, arguing passionately for a halt to the controversial coloring of black and white films. Media entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has led the colorization field, releasing computer-colored versions of such classics as `` Casablanca'' and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s `` It's a Wonderful Life.'' `` All of this is done for them to make a buck,'' said <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>. `` Let them go out and make an honest buck.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> told reporters in his halting cadence that he agreed with <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>, `` but for me to say the same thing would take so very much longer, I better not say it.'' The two were joined in their rounds by directors <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanovich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinnemann </PERSON> and several other top American filmmakers. The <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> push for legislation included testimony before a congressional committee two weeks ago by directors <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said he came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because he was appalled by the colorization of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON>'s `` It's a Wonderful Life,'' after <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> bought the rights to the movie. `` As <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s health deteriorated, he found to his horror that ` It's a Wonderful Life' was one of the first films that was colorized. It broke his heart,'' an emotional <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` I am determined to do whatever I can to make things right for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON>,'' he said. The directors and actors want <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to expand the nation's copyright laws to give directors and writers perpetual `` moral rights'' over what can be done to their works Under a plan supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, those who hold exhibition rights to completed movies would not be allowed to make changes _ such as adding color _ without the filmmakers' permission `` I see myself today in movies where the story has been distorted and the movie chopped up,'' said <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>. `` Yet, my name is on it. I think, ` What are they doing to me?' `` They do n't own me. They're using my name as a kind of draw. That's felonious, really.'' Although he was passionate before the news cameras, drawing memories of his roles as a tough guy dating back to the 1940s, <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> said he toned down his private performance before members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're dealing with politicians _ we have to be a little political too,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Aaron's Way'' made it into the top 10 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings as the television season winds down and the networks begin giving spring tryouts to potential series. Last week's ratings were skewed by pre-emptions for college basketball and the Rev. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s televised fund-raising, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> still won, taking the top five places. Network analysts estimate that about a quarter of the country's network affiliates pre-empted network shows for the <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> crusade on Friday night, lowering the networks' ratings <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s show is syndicated, so its ratings are n't included in the weekly Nielsens. With only five weeks left, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is holding onto second place in the season-long ratings race, thanks to high ratings for its Winter Olympics coverage. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time rating of 15.9. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 12.7 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 11.8. The season-to-date averages are <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 16.3, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 14.0 and CBS 13.6. To make up the 0.4 point it lags behind <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> would have to beat <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> by two points each of the remaining five weeks of the season, an unlikely prospect. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, however, has rebounded in news ratings. For the week that ended Friday, the `` CBS Evening News'' had an average rating of 11.1, its second-straight victory. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had a 10.2 and `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.4. The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. After a lengthy reign at the top of the news ratings last summer, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is now struggling in third, although the close rankings make the news race virtually a three-way tie. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said results of the November sweeps showed <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> with a disadvantage in local news lead-in. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates had an average rating of 11.5, which `` Nightly News'' improved on, to 11.9. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had the best advantage. Its affiliates had an average rating of 12.9, and the network newscast improved that to 13.1. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates averaged a 12.0 rating and the network broadcast was a 12.3. `` Network news is an island in a sea of local news,'' said <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>. `` If the local news is going down, there's not much you can do to keep the network news from going down, too.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> continued to dominate prime time. `` The Cosby Show'' was No. 1 even though the episode was a repeat. Next was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' `` A Different World,'' `` Night Court'' and `` Golden Girls.'' The rest of the top 10: `` Murder, She Wrote'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` The People's Choice Awards'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` 60 Minutes'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Growing Pains'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> `` Aaron's Way,'' a new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series starring <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> as the patron of an Amish family trying to cope in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, made its debut at No. 10, the best showing of the crop of new series getting spring tryouts. The premiere movie of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s new series `` Probe'' did well, landing in 28th place, but its regular time period on Thursday did n't make a dent in the ratings and was ranked 60th of 68. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> seems to have successfully transplanted `` Growing Pains'' from Tuesday to Wednesday, where it was strong enough to pull `` Head of the Class'' into 11th place. <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> proved she is still a ratings draw. Her <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> Slept Here'' was 12th. CBS did make headway against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Thursday's lineup with the debut of `` 48 Hours'' in its new time period opposite `` Cosby.'' Last week's documentary on runaways ranked 34th with a rating of 22.9. The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Buck James,'' `` Probe,'' `` <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON>,'' `` West 57th,'' `` Hotel,'' `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manilow </PERSON>, Swing Street,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Super Tuesday coverage, `` The Thorns,'' CBS' Super Tuesday coverage and `` The Redeye Express.

 Attackers fired pistols and hurled hand grenades at a graveside service for three slain <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas today, killing three people and injuring 34, police reported. One man was arrested. Thousands of mourners threw themselves to the ground as the explosions ripped across the Milltown Roman Catholic cemetery, while hundreds of others raced across the graves pursuing a suspected attacker. One attacker, weaving and dodging between gravestones, flung a hand grenade at the pursuing mourners. Organizers of the funeral for the guerrillas, who were shot by British troops in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, immediately blamed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitaries for the attack. Police moved in to surround the cemetery and a dozen ambulances ferried the 34 injured, including several young children hit by gunfire, to the nearby <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The three dead, all men, were not immediately identified. A hospital spokeswoman said one of the injured, a woman, was in serious condition and three men also were gravely wounded. `` It's obvious it was an attack by Loyalist -LRB- Protestant -RRB- movements,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political front, told reporters in the cemetery. The violence erupted about 15 yards away as the flag-draped coffins of <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, were being lowered into a single grave. The unarmed trio were shot March 6 by British troops in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities alleged the three were on a bombing mission. Within hours of the cemetery attack, youths hijacked and set fire to a bus in the <LOCATION> Ardoyne </LOCATION> area in nearby <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, despite <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> appeals for calm. It roused fears of renewed rioting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, already tense because of the funerals. At the cemetery, mourners screamed as at least five explosions rang out. <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON> said that witnesses had spotted four men getting out of white van and slip into the cemetery just before the attack. Amid scenes of chaos in the cemetery, several hundred youths gave chase to one attacker who fled, still firing and throwing a grenades, witnesses said. `` I saw maybe 300 youths chasing this one gunman who turned every 15-20 yards, threw a hand grenade and loosed off a shot before running again,'' said cab driver <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>. `` The mourners were gaining, but bunched up and he threw another grenade into the middle of them, then got out on to the motorway. ... He was egging them on to come and get him when he threw the grenade.'' At the cemetery, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> organizers completed the funeral while priests comforted the wounded. The Rev. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who was saying prayers next to the graveside as the last of the coffins draped in the Irish tricolor was being lowered, said he saw a young man throwing something from the back of the crowd. `` I thought they were stones, but it looks as if they were grenades. He was also firing shots into the crowd.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials said Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was immediately informed. The mourners had followed the coffins through somber streets to the cemetery. At a mass earlier in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agnes </LOCATION>, mourners listened silently as the priest charged that the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men were murdered. Shortly before the funeral began, a bomb exploded on a street more than a mile from the church, slightly injuring a British soldier on foot patrol, police reported. The almost exclusively <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, join it with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and set up an all-Ireland socialist state. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says the slain guerrillas were shot by commandos while preparing a car bomb attack on the changing of the guard outside the governor's residence in the colony on the southern tip of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The three were unarmed, but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said they made movements that led the soldiers to believe their lives were in danger. The Irish government has complained that the soldiers should have tried to arrest the trio. In the tense buildup to the funerals, Protestants stoned hearses that brought the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bodies home Tuesday.

 Soldiers today battled more than 100 communist rebels who burned a town hall and kidnapped three policemen. At least four rebels and three soldiers were killed, the military said. Before dawn, about 120 rebels entered <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, and most took over the municipal building while others searched homes, Maj. <PERSON> Wilmur </PERSON> <PERSON> Panabang </PERSON> told repoters. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> is 210 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Panabang </PERSON>, the Philippine Constabulary assistant provincial commander, said troops arrived at daybreak in trucks and an armored personnel carrier from the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Bangued </LOCATION>, about 20 miles away, and attacked the rebel positions. The troops were backed by three helicopter gunships, but <PERSON> Panabang </PERSON> denied they fired rockets at the rebels in the town hall. `` We wanted to do that but we were afraid to miss and hit houses instead because the town hall is in the middlle of town,'' he said. Provincial Governor <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Valera </PERSON> ordered the evacuation of residents from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and nearby villages during the fighting and military pursuit operations to prevent civilians from getting hit in the crossfire. At least four rebels and three soldiers were killed before the guerrillas broke off the engagement about five hours later, set fire to the building and retreated to the nearby mountains, <PERSON> Panabang </PERSON> said. Only seven bodies were recovered following the fighting, including those of two soldiers whose remains were charred in the fire. But <PERSON> Panabang </PERSON> quoted witnesses as saying the rebels loaded nine bodies on a commandeered jeep as they departed. He said the rebels `` may very well have suffered up to 13 dead'' in the raid. One trooper also was wounded in the fighting, <PERSON> Panabang </PERSON> said. The retreating guerrillas took three police hostages with them, including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arcanghel </PERSON>, he said. More than 100 troops backed by the three helicopter gunships and the armored personnel carrier pursued the rebel force into the hills around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> until midday, <PERSON> Panabang </PERSON> said. He said the military planned to resume pursuit of the rebels shortly. The attack was the bloodiest in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> this year and was the second in <LOCATION> Abra </LOCATION> province.

 Two crane operators at a plutonium production plant were contaminated with a low level of radiation, and one of the men carried the radiation into his home, a plant spokesman said. Investigators found radiation in the cab of a crane at the plant but the source of the contamination has not been determined, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanford </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the Plutonium-Uranium Extraction Plant at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation under government contract. Contamination was found on one of the men when he reported to work Monday and a check of his home determined he had spread the contamination there, <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said. Radiation was found on the other employee's hands and clothes Monday as he prepared to leave for the day, <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said. The level of radiation was extremely low and posed no health threat, he said. Both operators were decontaminated and given clearance to return to work. A radiation team checked the homes of the two crane operators and two other employees Monday night, <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said. They removed a wash cloth, electric razor, towel and undershirt from the home of the employee who registered contamination when he arrived at work, he said. The maximum contamination level in the crane operator's home was 3,500 counts per minute, or less than half the radiation present in the glowing part of a lighted gas lantern, <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said. `` You can buy higher levels of radiation at the store,'' he said. It was n't known how radiation on the operator who contaminated his home had been missed in daily checks of employees leaving the plant. The contamination was isolated at the plant in the area surrounding the crane, he said. Investigators' preliminary report will be issued within 10 working days, <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said.

The White House budget office issues its spending plan. The spending is all geared to impossibly high economic growth predictions. In six or eight months, it becomes apparent that there just is n't that much steam in the economy. Shame might compel most people to concede, but this is where this budget office gets tough. ... Only when evidence of this impossible optimism becomes just mountainous do the president's men back off a bit in their predictions. And as it retreats, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> is required to observe that there's a new economic boom coming, just around the corner. Recently President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fiscal 1989 budget was issued. ... A deficit of $ 130 billion is foreseen. To make all these figures come out so serendipitously, the White House budget office underlaid them with a forecast of 2.4 percent economic growth in calendar 1988 and 3.5 percent growth in calendar 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has now come out with its own economic forecast. It envisions growth of 0.6 percent less in'88 and 0.9 percent less in'89. Run the White House budget numbers off that base and it produces a fiscal 1989 deficit of $ 165 billion. Under the usual rules, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would n't admit its optimism before about September. But this being the year of transitional election, it may never admit it. It is <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last chance to set a new record for rosy optimism. He'll probably want to have a run at it.

The governors _ along with mayors, city councils and school boards _ believe they deserve far more credit for honesty, good will and competence than the federal rulemakers are willing to give them.

The massive bill, which sets out an $ 11.6 million drug-fighting program, is the state's broadest attack on drug abuse in years and deserves bipartisan support.

Named for a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> basketball player who died in 1986 after taking cocaine, this provision would allow prosecution of drug suppliers on charges of second-degree murder if a client died of drug use. While that provision likely would have a deterrent effect on drug dealers and should be retained in the bill's final version, it is by no means the heart of the legislation. Debate over its inclusion should not be permitted to hold up legislative approval of the omnibus bill. More important are the bill's -LRB- 1 -RRB- stiffer criminal penalties for the sale and use of a broad class of drugs and -LRB- 2 -RRB- needed funds for drug and alcohol treatment programs. ... The bill strongly deserves approval before the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> adjourns.

 A woman charged with keeping an 8-year-old boy in a coffin-like box for two years said she confined the boy to protect her possessions and pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment. `` I restrained -LRB- the boy -RRB- during my sleeping hours in order to keep him from destroying property. My judgment may not have been proper, but my judgment as to the amount of restraint seemed proper to me under the circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Retha </PERSON> <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON> in a handwritten statement. Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON>, 54, entered her plea Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Swayze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who set sentencing for April 26. In exchange for the plea, the prosecution agreed that Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON> be sentenced under provisions for first-time offenders, said deputy prosecutor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Corey-Boulet </PERSON>. That means a judge could sentence the woman to up to 90 days in jail plus two years' probation and counseling. Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON> was charged with keeping the son of her step-granddaughter in a playhouse-sized box from May 1, 1985, to May 1, 1987. The box often was locked and contained a jar in which the boy was expected to urinate, the charges said. The boy was not allowed to attend school. An anonymous referral tipped off state <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> workers on April 29, 1987, and they took the boy and his 11-year-old sister into custody. The siblings have lived with foster parents and are doing well, Ms. <PERSON> Corey-Boulet </PERSON> said. One of Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON>' adult sons said the confinement was a temporary way to handle the tantrum-prone boy. He said the family believed he was brain-damaged because of his mother, who the son said abused drugs and would n't take proper care of the boy. The natural mother denied she was a drug abuser.

The plant's juice contains opium, which can be refined into morphine and heroin. `` We are doing this so that drug addicts will not feel tempted to pick or cut the poppies to get the drug, and so that farmers will continue to be allowed to grow poppies,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> of <PERSON> Daehnfeldt </PERSON>, the biggest seed producer in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Drug addicts have been known to plunder poppy fields in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. In other countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, poppy cultivation has been banned. `` We ... have been able to reduce the opium content by half. In a couple of years, we expect to have more or less eliminated it completely,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Test Critic Files Fraud Complaints in 50 States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> physician has filed consumer fraud complaints in all 50 states charging four major publishers with selling achievement tests that give a misleadingly rosy picture of student progress. The complaints were filed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, who gained prominence last November as a test gadfly with a 26-page report accusing publishers of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Test and similar tests of giving `` children, parents, school systems, legislatures, and the press misleading reports on achievement levels.'' The November report led officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to summon 40 test experts and publishers to a closed-door meeting last month to discuss possible actions. <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, who is from <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, filed his complaints Wednesday with the 50 state attorneys general, and distributed them to reporters But he said he had not provided copies to the publishers named in the complaints. Three of the four publishers said they had no comment because they had n't seen the complaint. But a spokesman for CTB @ <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, publisher of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Achievement Test and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, said <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>'s work was `` full of fallacious statements.'' <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>'s complaint claimed `` that 90 percent of school districts and 70 percent of children in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s public elementary schools are presently testing above average in elementary grades on one of the six commercial tests used in the U.S.A.'' Thirty-eight of the complaints named CTB @ <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>; 36 named <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the Stanford Achievement Test and the Metropolitan Achievement Test; 31 cited <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Test of Basic Skills, and 26 listed <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> SRA </ORGANIZATION> exam. The complaints ask that publishers be required to identify school districts using their tests, provide free annual updates of the norms that determine how students score, and provide new test questions for free each year to ensure that schools can not `` teach to the test.'' <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, founder and head of the 700-member <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> watchdog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also called upon each state to analyze standardized tests to determine if they have gotten easier over time. He also demanded that test publishers supply new, more accurate tests at no charge to `` compensate consumers for any misrepresentations received from previously deceptive tests.'' In September, <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> filed similar consumer complaints in his home state and in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. He withdrew them last month after <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> announced it would provide annually updated norms. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, director of research and management of CTB @ <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> condemned standardized tests generally for giving too rosy a picture of student progress, but `` he only looks at half the pie'' because <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> omits the fact that test scores for high school students have declined. Responding to some of <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>'s specific complaints, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said publishers would probably resist demands to identify school districts using their tests. `` We have a responsibility to protect the confidentiality of our customers,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said his company already updates test norms annually, but he rejected <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>'s demand that that service be provided free. He said it would be possible for testmakers to provide states with new questions each year, `` but it's also expensive. If our customers want it, we would respond.'' He added that the technical manuals that publishers routinely provide school districts using their tests already provide much of the information <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> demanded, such as how difficult the tests are.

<HEAD>Future of Kremlin Policy Abroad Also at Stake in Geneva Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hopes for an end to the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have focused attention on talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> this week, but more is at stake than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military withdrawal from the 9-year-old conflict. The Kremlin's apparent willingness to extract its estimated 115,000 troops may signal a broader policy change in the superpower's role in foreign revolutions. Should an acceptable retreat be found from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the conflict between pro- and anti-Communist forces be left to the Afghans, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would heal one of his nation's most visible foreign policy sores. He also could improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the Indian subcontinent and the Moslem world. Perhaps most importantly, some observers suggest, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> might be rethinking its role in promoting socialist revolution in nations such as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where Soviet aid bolsters government forces against tenacious opposition. The Afghan revolution is the only struggle in which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledges its troops are fighting. Since the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> announced last year that it had taken the `` political decision'' to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the state-run media and officials have hinted that policies that led to the Dec. 27, 1979, intervention are under close scrutiny. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON>, a leading economist who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter published Wednesday that he warned the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> less than a month after the intervention that sending Soviet soldiers to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> damaged relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and Moslem nations. While Marxist doctrine forecasts the spread of socialist revolution worldwide, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made it clear that his first priority is getting his own nation's economy on its feet. The government has indicated it will fulfill its contractual agreements, even in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that military aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was not subject to negotiation in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> because it was part of longstanding cooperation with <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. However, some American Sovietologists and veteran foreign policy experts see in the military withdrawal the possible emergence of a policy of improving relations with other nations and directing resources to domestic needs. `` I see them moving toward a different approach to regional conflict,'' former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I get the distinct impression they are changing substantially their view of the projection of power, in part on the basis of their experience in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> we were affected by our experience in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this week for a conference on Soviet reforms, served as defense secretary in the 1960s during the height of the Vietnam War under presidents <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s stated sentiment for focusing time and money on improving the Soviet lifestyle is genuine, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> suggested, he will find it expedient to reduce Soviet involvement in struggles between pro- and anti-Communist forces. He pointed to civil warfare in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as examples where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may be willing to step out if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Legvold </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, accompanied a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delegation to a three-hour meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week. He said he is convinced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his advisers have made a commitment to `` cut their losses'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and have already begun a serious analysis of how the mistake of intervening was made. `` There is a feeling it was a lousy decision in all contexts _ in U.S.-Soviet relations, in relations with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries, in Sino-Soviet relations,'' <PERSON> Legvold </PERSON> said. The key move in working toward an Afghan peace accord was an end to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> insistence that the postwar government retain its current socialist character, said <PERSON> Legvold </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and author of several books on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> could teach the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> `` the constraints of power'' and that losing a conventional war in the nuclear age does not necessarily threaten their security.

<HEAD>Harris Poll Finds Lost Leisure Hurts Arts Attendance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents say they would be willing to pay higher taxes to give their children more education in the arts, according to pollster <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Seventy percent of respondents said they would pay an extra $ 10 in taxes for that purpose, and 56 percent would pay an extra $ 25, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are nothing less than outraged at the cuts that have been made in the arts in the curricula of public schools,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said Tuesday. He said nine of 10 people polled said, `` it's highly important for children of school age to be exposed to theater, music and dance, exhibitions of paintings and sculpture and similar cultural events.'' Fifty-eight of those polled believe their children are being deprived of that experience, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` Two of three give the arts as important billing as math, science, English, languages and social studies,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` This is a powerful mandate _ one that's gone too long unheeded by the school establishment in this country.'' However, despite support for arts in the schools, people are going to performances less. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said decreases of 12 percent in attendance and 3 percent in participation were the first declines sustained since 1973, when he began regularly sampling national attitudes about the arts. Although 33 percent of those polled said lack of time was the reason they did n't go to more arts performances, 32 percent said not enough performances were offered where they live and 29 percent said ticket prices are too high. `` No doubt price is an important element,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, but he called time more important. Until the current poll, the amount of time devoted to the arts had grown _ despite a decline in leisure time from a median of 26.2 hours a week in 1973 to 18.1 hours in 1984. In the poll, a telephone survey of 1,501 adults conducted for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in March and April 1987, leisure time slipped to 16.6 hours a week overall, with women, blacks and Hispanics below the median. The survey group, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, represented a national cross-section. The survey showed that Hispanics have 13 hours a week of leisure time, and blacks, although gaining nearly three hours a week since 1984, still have only 15. Women, increasingly combining jobs and homemaking, report having 14 hours a week for leisure time, while men have 19 hours, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` When people have lost leisure time, they have turned to VCRs,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. He said that `` 44 percent of owners of VCRs report that they are increasingly watching a movie or some other performance on videotape instead of watching regularly scheduled programs on television.'' `` People want to be able to pick and choose precisely what they'll be doing with their precious but limited leisure time,'' he said. `` If they have an hour and 10 minutes _ and people are measuring it that way _ they're highly likely to pick out a videocassette that appeals to them and make a date with themselves to enjoy it.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> grounds will be opened to limited deer hunting this fall for the first time in 18 years because of a burgeoning deer population and dwindling forage. Without the hunting season, some of the estimated 1,500 to 2,000 deer could starve to death. The Oct. 15-Nov. 13 season for antlerless deer will be limited to 80 hunters _ 40 from the public and 40 academy personnel, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Seamans </PERSON>, regional state wildlife manager Only rifles may be used. Many of the deer who roam the academy appear to have little fear of people, but while they have been shielded from hunters for nearly two decades, their lives have not been risk-free. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Babler </PERSON>, academy resources officer, said about 100 deer are killed by motorists each year on academy reservation roads and adjoining Interstate 25. In 1986, there were 186 collisions between cars and deer on or near the academy, he said.

 A <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> art gallery filed federal lawsuits accusing a dealer of operating a $ 32.5 million nationwide forgery network specializing in the works of surrealist painter <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>. T.R. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, whose <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> gallery was raided in August when forgery allegations surfaced, was named with four others in the $ 145 million package of suits filed last week in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on behalf of <PERSON> Galerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Furstenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

That, he says, is why he has tried to help a police effort to abolish a civilian review board and get the city to hire more officers. `` I'm about to decide that the perception around here is that if you're not an elected official, I ought to just sit out in the office and make money,'' <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> editors Tuesday. `` Fine.

The May 1 dedication of <PERSON> Fasanella </PERSON>'s `` Lawrence 1912: The Bread and Roses Strike,'' will culminate months of planning and fund-raising, said City Hall spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. Half the $ 100,000 price of the painting was donated by the state; private donations and more than $ 10,000 from unions around the nation were raised, said <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>.

 An engine fire broke out today on the Scandinavian Star, leaving the cruise ship adrift for hours in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with more than 700 people on board, authorities said. `` The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> navy to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>,'' said Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cutter Vigilance was escorting the ship as a precaution, he said. No fire injuries were reported, but an unidentified 71-year-old male passenger suffered a heart attack. A helicopter was dispatched from <ORGANIZATION> Homestead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to the man up. The Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off <LOCATION> Isla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mujeres </LOCATION>, a Mexican island north of the tourist resort <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said that even though the fire was under control, the engine room had been sealed off and carbon dioxide had been pumped in, and the ship was dead in the water. The cruise ship <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and another vessel, the <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> I, were standing by to assist. The <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>'s captain, <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorn </PERSON>, said that the fire appeared to have been brought under control, and there was no reason to evacuate the ship. `` In the event that the fire breaks out again, and that passengers have to evacuate the vessel, we will be there to assist and take the passengers,'' <PERSON> Thorn </PERSON> said. `` Our report is that it's under control, they have engine compartment sealed and they've pumped CO2 in there to smother the flames,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogeley </PERSON> said. Petty Officer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said the ship's captain had requested additional fire-fighting equipment, such as foam and CO2. Among the 449 passengers and 266 crew members were a group of 16 high school seniors from <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who were accompanied by other family members. The seniors had raised money for their trip with chili suppers and car washes. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said nobody in the party was injured, according to schools superintendent <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>. The ship should arrive in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> late Wednesday or Thursday, said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> SeaEscape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the ship's owner, said the passengers would then be flown to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. The ship was returning to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> after a three-day, four-night cruise to <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> when the fire broke out, she said. Dye and Ms. <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON> said officials were n't sure what sparked the fire, which began shortly after 1 a.m. `` It will take a week before we know the cause and the extent of the damage,'' said Ms. <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON>. A sister ship to the Star, the Scandanavian Sun, caught fire in the port of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in August 1984, leaving a woman passenger and a crew member dead. Ms. <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON> said there was no connection between the two incidents.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it plans to sell jet fighter planes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and to equip <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s six Soviet-built submarines with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> torpedoes and radar. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> also would purchase an unspecified number of M-60 tanks, while <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would buy P-3 <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> aircraft to hunt submarines, as well as either AWACS or <LOCATION> Hawkeye </LOCATION> radar planes. The classified report covering projected arms sales for 1988 was sent Feb. 25 to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

The 75 F-16 jet fighters ticketed for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are intended to compensate for the Lavi, the warplane <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was building with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial support. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, the project was canceled last August after $ 1.3 billion had been spent on it. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, another close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, would purchase an unspecified number of F-16s, and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, a small oil state in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, would obtain four of the jet fighters, plus helicopters. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is due to get equipment for its U.S.-built AWACS radar planes and also $ 500 million worth of <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION> armored personnel carriers. About 400 Bradleys could be purchased with $ 500 million. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which has the largest fleet of submarines in the Arab world, will be able to modernize the six supplied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Two others were sold to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration also informed the congressional committees it would build a $ 2 billion factory in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to provide M-1 tanks for the Egyptian armed forces and separately sell <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> $ 60 million worth of M-60 tanks and <LOCATION> Hawkeye </LOCATION> radar planes. Stingers, the shoulder-fired missile that Afghan guerrillas have used effectively against Soviet airplanes and helicopters, would be sold to several countries, including <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents seized the passport of a man they accused of smuggling 10 to 12 pounds of cocaine just hours after a new get-tough policy went into effect, agency spokesmen said. `` A lot of people come in with contraband and go right back out of the country without going to court. It's become a joke,'' <PERSON> Vann </PERSON> <PERSON> Capps </PERSON>, director of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said of the passport seizure policy. `` This is another tool we can use that is vital to our defense against drugs,'' he said. The new rule will apply to anyone attempting to bring illegal drugs into the country, regardless of how small the amount, <PERSON> Capps </PERSON> said. Customs officers routinely make six to 10 drug seizures daily at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport; the new program could result in the confiscation of hundreds of passports weekly, he said. Some legal experts have criticized the new policy. They question the constitutionality of restricting a person's freedom to travel before the person has been convicted of a crime. On Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Borelli </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, brought home two suitcases with false sides on a flight that originated in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, and stopped in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. `` Within the false sides of the suitcases, inspectors found approximately 10 to 12 pounds of cocaine,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Borelli </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport was seized and he was arrested about 5 a.m., five hours after the policy took effect, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Borelli </PERSON>, charged with unlawful importation of cocaine and possession of a controlled substance, was turned over to the vice president's drug task force, which prosecutes federal cases. Customs inspectors turned <PERSON> Borelli </PERSON>'s passport over to federal prosecutors, who can use it as evidence, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. Once the case is resolved, <PERSON> Borelli </PERSON> will have to apply to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to get the passport back.

 <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> said it will abandon a policy that denied credit cards to some liberal arts majors after students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> demanded the bank's representatives be barred from campus <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said on Wednesday the bank was retreating from the policy and that it would be discontinued by the end of June. He admitted the company had received complaints from several universities around the country, but he would not name them. Although <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said in a telephone interview `` using the major was a good indicator of future earning potential and of students' ability to pay debt,'' he would not describe how the policy was applied <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said other factors would be used to judge students' credit worthiness, but he would not specify what they are A spokesman for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Comptroller of the Currency in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act does not prohibit using a student's academic major in a credit application system. Spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said they were surprised by the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> policy, since their organizations had found that students were good credit risks. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, along with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> the largest credit card issuers, said they do not use academic majors as part of their credit scoring system for students. The UC students complained they were denied credit cards because of their studies in such areas as English, rhetoric, art history and Italian. They said the bank's representatives would be barred from campus unless there was a change in the policy. `` This was obvious, senseless discrimination, that in effect said students in business or engineering majors are the ones who will be making all the money and that only they could be trusted,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, 22. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, a major in art history major last fall at <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> rejected her application for a Visa card last fall because of her `` field of study.'' `` What I study says nothing about my responsibility or whether or not I can pay my bills,'' said <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, who graduated in December and now works in retail sales. `` It seems like they're trying to promote engineering and business majors. We can not condone such discrimination in our society,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yip </PERSON>, turned down by <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 13 because of his rhetoric major. <PERSON> Yip </PERSON>, 22, received a Visa last year while attending a different college as a mathematics major. The <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> policy, apparently part of a credit scoring system, was uncovered last week when a reporter for the independent campus newspaper, The Daily Californian, asked a campus bank-card canvasser how to apply. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> representatives set up tables around the student union to accept credit applications. The canvasser, reporter <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said, advised her to fill in the credit application by listing business administration or electrical engineering as her major, instead of English. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a senator in <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>'s student government, said she was investigating complaints against <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> as well as against a local department store that reportedly also has denied credit to students because of their majors.

 Two newspapers have published accounts of homelessness in the capital, saying vagrants are living in underground passages, garbage dumps and staircases. The reports, in the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Kurier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polski </ORGANIZATION> and in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> evening daily <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wieczorny </ORGANIZATION>, offered an unusually vivid discussion of the topic of homelessness, which officially does not exist in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist system. The articles, published Monday, also reflect the current liveliness of the official press in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in which censorship of news on domestic topics has been markedly relaxed. `` Statistics do n't say how many homeless people there are in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But from unofficial sources we know there are about 15,000 of them in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> alone,'' said Express Wieczorny. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s population is 1.5 million The Kurier Polski article talked about a colony of 20-50 homeless people recently discovered living in underground passages for the city's central water heating system. `` Until not long ago nobody knew that the dark, unending corridors ... were pulsating with life. Along with all kinds of worms, the capital's tramps are living there,'' the paper said. Asked about the reports at his weekly news conference Tuesday, government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said he had not seen the articles, but, `` I stand by my statement that there is no such social problem as homelessness in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Although there is a severe housing shortage in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, there is no evident homelessness in the streets. Beggars are rarely seen and vagrancy is a crime. According to the articles, the homeless include alcoholics, ex-convicts, mentally ill people and people who are estranged from their relatives. `` Most of them resigned from normal family life by their own will. One day they simply left their homes and went away,'' said the Kurier Polski article. `` They live in railway stations, in staircases, in garbage dumps and even in -LRB- underground -RRB- canals,'' said the Express Wieczorny article. `` They are dirty, often have head louses and are exhausted because of malnutrition.'' It said their number is growing. The paper said a church social organization, the <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Chmielowski </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, is active in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and five other cities helping to arrange shelter and jobs for the homeless. The society gets support from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, it said. <PERSON> Kurier </PERSON> <PERSON> Polski </PERSON>, the official paper of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is allied with the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party, said the homeless people redeem bottles or rummage through trash and sell salvageable clothing at the city's markets `` Every earned zloty goes for the purchase of vodka,'' it said. It said the colony living in the underground corridors near the Zeran heat and power plant was discovered two weeks ago when one of the inhabitants died from alcohol poisoning. After a few days, some of the vagrants reported the death to nuns, who summoned police, the newspaper said.

 The superpowers use <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> as a center for espionage, and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> has nearly 100 agents here, while the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has 10 or 11, according to a book published this week. `` <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s proximity to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the -LRB- Soviet -RRB- <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states makes <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> a natural junction for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s network of agents on the other side of the Baltic Sea,'' said the book, `` Espionage in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>,'' It also said that three out of five Soviet diplomats in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> are spies, `` a proportion usually reserved for Soviet embassies in cities like <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>.'' The book, sponsored by the current affairs magazine <ORGANIZATION> Tempus </ORGANIZATION>, brought up to date a series of articles that ran in the respected magazine in 1984. It often quoted local and foreign newspapers and books in addition to its own sources. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s security police said only the director was authorized to comment on the book and that he was unavailable. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Guer </PERSON> said the book, which was mailed to news agencies, had not reached the ministry and he also could not comment. `` The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> personnel working in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> ... regularly meet their superiors in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> ... Highly placed intelligence officers from both <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are often seen in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>,'' the book said. When <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankin </PERSON>, known as a Soviet literary critic and editor, was proposed as ambassador in 1982, the <LOCATION> Swedish </LOCATION> security police cleared him as a `` harmless intellectual.'' The Swedes later learned he was a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> disinformation specialist, it said. In 1973, <PERSON> Pankin </PERSON> was named president of the copyright organization that handled sales of Soviet music and books abroad and of foreign works to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The book claimed the office was a front for a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> section responsible for disinformation and Soviet propaganda abroad. `` <PERSON> Pankin </PERSON>, as head of Special Services A, must be one of the top 30 commanders within the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, probably with the rank of a major general,'' the book said. It said <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents here were engaged in political espionage, counterespionage against <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc refugees, industrial and scientific intelligence, and planning sabotage operations in case of war. `` It is impossible to prevent <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> men from coming here. If that were the case, there would not be many people left at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>,'' the book quoted one veteran officer of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s security police as saying. `` Besides, it can be safer to know that the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> personnel is at the embassy.

 How fares the shamrock this St. Patrick's Day Just fine, says botanist <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, whose desk is cluttered with samples from all over the country. The sprigs of green have been arriving in response to an appeal by <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who is conducting the first survey of the state of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s national plant in nearly a century. His timing is perfect, since Thursday is St. Patrick's Day, when Irish minds turn to the `` chosen leaf of bard and chief, <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erin </LOCATION>'s native Shamrock'' and men, women and children adorn their lapels with a sprig picked from garden, roadside or local supermarket But the shamrock's life is as fleeting as a ray of sunshine in the Irish rain, and by the end of Thursday's St. Patrick's Day parade through <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> the streets will be littered with wilted shamrock. Myths galore surround the three-leafed weed. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> is supposed to have used the three leaves to explain the Holy Trinity to a Gaelic chieftain. In the 18th century the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> establishment accepted it as a national symbol, like the Welsh leek, Scottish thistle and English rose. It was later adopted as a symbol of defiance in the fight for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` Viva la, the rose shall fade, And the shamrock shine for ever new!'' sang <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the 19th-century rebel bard. Today the shamrock emblem adorns everything from the national airline to bags of peat moss fertilizer. But what exactly is the shamrock? In 1893, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> legal clerk <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Colgan </PERSON> set out to catalogue all the species, and concluded there were four main kinds. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> concludes the shamrock is merely a humble clover too often dressed up in `` colorful legend and sentimental nonsense.'' The word shamrock derives from <LOCATION> Seamrog </LOCATION>, Irish for `` little clover,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> held up two plastic bags of shamrock. One, sent to him from <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, had large-leafed shamrocks. The other, from <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wicklow </LOCATION> in the south, had much smaller, darker leaves. `` This one is shamrock because the person who collected it believed it to be shamrock, and I accept that. And the same goes for the other one too,'' he said in an interview. `` It's a matter of a rose by any other name smelling just as sweet. A shamrock is what a person believes is shamrock,'' he said, adding: `` Botanically the plants used as shamrock are in fact clover. But if you tell an Irishman that he's wearing clover, not shamrock, he will feel insulted.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who markets shamrock souvenirs, has his own definition: `` You know it when you see it.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s factory 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, turns out 300,000 souvenirs a year, from key rings to ornamental plates, all decorated with real shamrock preserved by a secret formula. `` We have a shamrock here that's 17 years old and still green,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said there was no basis for the story about <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> and the shamrock, saying that only in 1650, more than 1,000 years after the patron saint of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> lived, was the shamrock first recorded as being something more than an weed.

 In an off-the-cuff comment Wednesday that he immediately regretted, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that he sometimes has not told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> all that it wants to know. The incident occurred when reporters asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about his contention that he knew of no laws being broken in the Iran-Contra affair. If that were so, he was asked, why did <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, his former national security adviser, plead guilty last week to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? `` He just pleaded guilty to not telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> everything it wanted to know.

I just think <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would like to be asking questions about almost anything, anytime.'' Trying to cut off the conversation, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` This is in the courts. Let's wait and determine whether they say the law has been broken.'' As reporters were escorted from the room, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to his guest, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, and said in a whisper: `` Oh boy. Just for that careless remark ... they'll go wild about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or something.'' The remark was picked up by a microphone.

<HEAD>Legislatures May Be Able To Reverse Tuition Guarantee Tax Ruling</HEAD>

 States may be able to avoid paying federal taxes on college tuition prepayment plans simply by rewriting laws governing such programs, a tax law expert said Wednesday. `` If you can drag it kicking and screaming into the normal function of a state governent,'' then a legal case could be made that earnings on a guaranteed college tuition trust's investments should be free of federal taxes, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jegen </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who also heads <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s tuition-guarantee program, BEST. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> would be required to pay federal taxes on its earnings, although individual investors in the trust would have no additional tax liability, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said Tuesday. Five states, including <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, have adopted tuition-guarantee programs modeled after <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s. Under the programs, parents who make advance payments into the trust fund are guaranteed that when their child is ready to enter a state college or university they can do so without additional cost. The payments typically can be made either all at once or periodically. The states invest the money, so the amount parents must pay depends upon not only the child's age when the payment is made and the estimated cost of tuition when the child reaches 18 but also on estimates of the trust's return on its investment. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> estimated the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ruling could add 20 percent to the cost of investing in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> trust, if the trust was fully invested in taxable bonds. <PERSON> Jegen </PERSON> said that because the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said parents would not have to pay taxes on their investments, state legislatures would have an opening for rewriting their laws. `` If they -LRB- IRS -RRB- have concluded that the investors are not subject to taxation, they have to have done that on some basis, that once you put your money away, the funds are no longer yours, that you are not an annual beneficiary of that fund,'' <PERSON> Jegen </PERSON> said. `` Once you separate the investors from the tax consequences and maybe conclude that the fund is subject to taxation, ... it would be a fairly small step to have that fund be a part of the state operations, so much so that it would not be subject to taxation.'' Constitutionally, the federal government can not tax the state in the performance of the functions a state is expected to perform, <PERSON> Jegen </PERSON> said. `` The further away you get from a governmental function, the more likely it is to be taxable,'' he said. For example, a license plate for a car is not subject to federal taxes because providing license plates is a normal state function, he said. Proceeds from the sales of textbooks at a campus bookstore are taxable, because a state is not expected to be in the business of selling books. <PERSON> Jegen </PERSON> said he had not seen the ruling, and his final analysis would depend in part on the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' precise argument. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, citing privacy considerations, would not explain the ruling, nor would it confirm a ruling had been made. Besides <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> have adopted guaranteed tuition programs similar to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s.

 Auto speed king <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and his wife were shot to death this morning in the driveway of their exclusive hillside home in what authorities said was `` an assassination'' by two gunmen who fled on bicycles. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 59, and his wife, <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>, were found dead at dawn by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's deputies responding to reports of gunfire, said Deputy <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatlin </PERSON>. `` It was a double homicide, an assassination,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinsmoor </PERSON>. Neighbors said they heard 6 or 8 shots before the bodies were found about 6 a.m. on the driveway in front of the couple's Spanish-style home on <LOCATION> Woodlyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in a high-security, gated community 20 miles northeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> They were shot to death, but the type of weapon was n't disclosed, <PERSON> Dinsmoor </PERSON> said The Thompsons were walking out to their van when they were ambushed. `` We do n't know a motive,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s were apparently leaving the house for work when the shooting occurred. He said he did n't know of any threats against the <ORGANIZATION> Thompsons </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> became famous as the `` Speed King'' in the 1950s when he set the first of his nearly 500 auto speed and endurance records. In 1960 he became the first to travel over 400 mph on land when he drove a four-engine streamlined car to a speed of 406.6 mph at the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. He later turned to drag racing, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> car racing, won a national economy championship and was a top competitor in road racing and off-road championships in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He was a drag racing innovator, building and driving the sport's first `` slingshot'' dragster He worked in the 1950s to take the sport off the streets onto sanctioned drag racing strips, and he was honored by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for his contributions to the youth of the state as well as the automotive industry. He was also well known as a promoter and his other sports activities included stunt flying and management of prizefighters. In pursuit of his land speed and Indy-car projects, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> often teamed with one of the auto industry's leading figures, <PERSON> Semon </PERSON> `` Bunkie'' <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> was a top executive with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> when he backed the <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> effort to break 400 mph. Later, when <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> moved from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> to become president of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> got company help with his own design of a Ford-powered dune buggy racer. As a racer, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> often failed to finish events because of mechanical breakdowns. He failed to finish in the first 27 powerboat races that he entered. He brought custom machines to <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> racing in the early 1960s, but again the cars he designed were fast but not durable. Longtime friend <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> described him as `` one of the greatest hot-rodders we've ever had'' and `` the dominant figure in off-road racing.'' `` He certainly had a colorful career,'' <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> said. `` We're all going to miss him.'' When he was 12, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> ended his first race at <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> by crashing his four-cylinder Ford Model B hot rod against a wall during the first lap. He was n't hurt because he was wearing a football helmet and was strapped inside with clothesline rope since he could n't afford a real crash helmet or seat belts. Racing put him in the hospital 27 times, including a seven-month stay when he was paralyzed from the waist down after a boat racing accident. It was two years before he walked again. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had a variety of other careers. He swept floors at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and later wrote sports articles there -LRB- `` Just to see if I could.'' -RRB-, sold 10-cent hamburgers at a drive-in, produced and directed racing movies, owned 29 different businesses -LRB- `` Every one of them has made money'' -RRB- and was mayor of <LOCATION> Rolling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the couple's 37-year-old son who is also an off-road racer, was n't immediately available for comment, said his publicist <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A bill to protect families from the financial threat of catastrophic illness is being threatened by a competing push for new subsidies for home health care, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., told reporters he believes the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which passed different version of the catastrophic health care bill, can agree on a version President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could sign A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan to phase in prescription drug benefits, as opposed to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provision putting them in place immediately, could keep down costs, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. That would make the bill more acceptable to the president, who first proposed the catastrophic coverage in his State of the Union address last year, he said. The catastrophic bill was being threatened, however, by Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s push for legislation to expand <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> to include home health care subsidies for the disabled and chronically ill, he said. Pepper, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and at 87 the oldest member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, got the chamber's leadership to schedule a vote on his five-year, $ 25 billion plan although it had not gone through the normal committee channels <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s tax-writing committee did not examine the proposal, which would be financed by raising <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> taxes <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said some health advocates were telling lawmakers to support the home care bill instead of the less-costly catastrophic insurance measure on the ground it is a more pressing need. He said there is a lot of political allure to having the government help people with those home health costs, especially in an election year. `` I do n't know whether any candidate, looking toward November, can say no to that,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. He said supporters were trying to push the bill through without the study needed to make it work. `` I doubt very much that I will support ... the Pepper bill,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. `` You're raising big bucks, and you're changing the whole direction of the health care system.'' There was no reason <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could not eventually move forward on both measures, but trying to do both this year would likely result in neither getting done, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. `` I'm trying to get one bill passed, and that's catastrophic health,'' he said.

<HEAD>Golden Fleece Award To Study That Shows Quail Sex Improves With
Practice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> gave his `` Golden Fleece'' award Wednesday to two government agencies for a $ 107,000 study that found the sexual performance of Japanese quail improved with practice. `` This project gives new meaning to bird watching,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said of the study, `` Learning and Reproductive Behavior.'' The research concluded that a peeping tom quail was much more interested in watching a female quail _ dead or alive _ than in looking at another male or even a female duck. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat, presents the `` Fleece'' each month to recognize what he considers a waste of taxpayer money. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said that since songwriter <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> made clear years ago that `` birds do it ...'' what need is there for research into `` stimuli and responses ... involved in various components of their sexual behavior?'' There's plenty of need, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which is sharing funds for the study with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` This was a study of learning _ not of the quail,'' <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The quail was chosen because it is an easily available laboratory animal that readily engages in the behavior that he -LRB- the researcher -RRB- wants to study. `` One reason he's studying learning in connection with reproduction is that reproduction happens to be one of the real strong motivating factors in animals,'' he said. <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> recalled similar criticism several years ago when another government agency was researching the sex life of the screwworm fly. That research, he said, enabled scientists to halt destruction of herds of cattle by the fly. According to a summary by the foundation, the quail research could even provide answers to the spread of AIDS. The `` research will ... tell us about an aspect of sexual behavior that has received little systematic attention to date,'' the foundation said. `` Given the life-threatening nature of certain forms of sexual behavior with the spread of AIDS, knowledge of how sexual habits are acquired is very important.'' The foundation selected Japanese quail for the study because of its uninhibited mating habits. `` When a sexually mature male is placed with a female, copulation occurs rapidly, often in less than five minutes,'' the foundation said. Researchers were interested in three `` sexual learning phenomena: sexual looking, classical conditioning of sexual arousal and improvement in copulatory performance with practice.'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said the study `` found that practice improved sexual performance. Even the most inhibited males ` eventually acquired as vigorous performance as all other subjects.''' It also found that the male quail spent a considerable amount of time staring at the female through a small window in a cage. `` The ` sexual looking' phenomenon was so strong that these amorous males did n't seem to care whether or not the female recipient of their longing glances was alive or dead,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> told colleagues. `` However, these male quail showed a distinct viewing preference for female quail over male quail or female ducks.'' Although the research `` may be well designed and carefully executed, the question remains whether, with massive federal deficits and limited funds for scientific research, spending for this project is the best use of taxpayers' monies,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> funded the early parts of the quail research, through March 1987; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> has been backing the study since. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said another $ 100,000-plus is expected to be spent by <ORGANIZATION> NIMH </ORGANIZATION> _ for a total of more than $ 200,000 _ over the next two years.

 A 94-year-old man's offer of $ 10,000 to anyone who can end his 65 years of hiccuping has drawn some exotic nostrums _ dill seed, magnesium phosphate, holy water, Indian hemp, among them _ but the man hiccups on. `` Unbelievable,'' <PERSON> Lucretia </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of rural <PERSON> Aitkin </PERSON> said as she sifted through some of the more than 5,000 letters, cassettes, and parcels that have poured into her home from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since her father, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, offered the reward in January. `` People really care. Even though the $ 10,000 is a big deal to some of them, a lot say keep the money and spend it in good health. It's unbelievable for that many people to write in this day and age,'' she said. Suggested remedies have ranged from homespun concoctions involving sugar and vinegar to scientific nerve-treatment regimens complete with detailed diagrams. Others endorse the healing powers of the mind. A <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, massage therapist explained how she cured a 75-year-old woman of a life-long burping problem and offered to work similar magic on <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>. A man from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> sent a brown dust, explaining it is `` vegetable powder'' that will cure hiccups if inserted in the nostrils. A German suggests pressing the right thumb against the little finger, while a Canadian swears that finger pressure applied to the bottom of the nose just right will expel the demon. Many of the would-be healers have the utmost confidence in their cures. One writer from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> advised <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> that a money order was the preferred means of payment, while a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> man pleaded: `` Please do n't tell anyone who cured you. I do n't want to go on TV and I do n't want the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> taking a big cut of a gift between friends.'' <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, who recently returned to his longtime home of <LOCATION> Anthon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, after spending six months in <LOCATION> Aitkin </LOCATION>, 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, has seen only a few hundred of the letters, and his family wo n't permit him to try the various elixirs. The messages that have been forwarded to <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> have lifted his spirits, though not his hopes for a cure, said another daughter, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Anthon </LOCATION> and takes care of him. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> suffers from a gall bladder condition and other ailments, Ms. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> has said. The letter that meant the most to him, said <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, came from a 17-year-old boy who describes his recent conversion to Christianity and suggests faith might be <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>'s best hope for relief. `` He thought it was just a real touching letter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The outpouring began after <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Brainerd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, that he would pay a $ 10,000 reward for a cure. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> report on the offer appeared in newspapers throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, who has yet to get a phone connected in his new home, could not be reached for comment. The international interest `` is exciting to him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` He does n't know what to think of it sometimes. He gets all this stuff in the mail, but I wo n't let him have any -LRB- of the potions -RRB- because you never know.'' A cure would still be most welcome, his family said. A case that has stumped scores of doctors, <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>'s hiccups are constant, painful and disruptive. They make eating solid food impossible and cause frequent vomiting, his family said. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> himself theorizes that his malady is the result of nerve damage suffered 66 years ago when he over-exerted himself lifting a hog on his farm. He said he has hiccuped ever since. The Guinness Book of World Records estimates he has hiccuped 430,000,000 times, calling it the longest-ever recorded attack of the hiccups. After all the years of failed advice from doctors, quacks, philanthropists and opportunists, <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> is pretty much resigned to hiccuping the rest of his life, said Ms. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. `` He's tried so many thousands of things,'' she said.

 Thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets of the capital today after rebellious soldiers failed to seize the headquarters of the nation's military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It was the largest outpouring of opposition to the military-dominated government since civilian opponents began trying to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure as head of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces last summer. Protesters erected flaming barricades across hundreds of streets throughout <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In the capital's financial and tourist district, as well as the poorer sections of the downtown business center, people chanted: `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go. ... <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>, tyrant, your end is near.'' Starting at about 8:15 a.m., nearby residents heard the sharp clatter of light arms fire inside the walled headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. It continued for at least half an hour. `` They were kisses,'' <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> said in response to reporters' questions about the gunshots about an hour after the firing ended <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appeared at the top of a stairway on one side of the headquarters building dressed in civilian clothes and accompanied by members of his high command. To reporters' shouted questions, the general responded: `` What happened is that you are visiting us here.'' <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, a civilian spokesman for the government, said a small group of lower-ranking officers had attempted a coup and that several were detained. A revolt in the military would be a serious blow to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who heads the nation's 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and is considered to be the real power behind <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian government. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been exerting pressure to drive him from power. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants him `` out of there.'' The economy has been crippled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined comment on the trouble in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I do n't have any information to confirm the report. We are aware there is turmoil in the city.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> had ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and their dependents `` not to go into public areas except for essential business.'' Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> confirmed that a coup was attempted and said roads leading to the canal had been blocked. The Defense Forces had closed off the entrance to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base near the canal administrative headquarters in <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> side, they said. `` The canal area is pretty well isolated,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON>, chairman of the commission's board of directors, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` But it is hard to tell from here exactly what that means.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, administrator of the commission, said he `` would not regard -LRB- the blockade -RRB- as a hostile act at this moment.'' Earlier, two <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporters and a photographer were stopped by soldiers as they approached the headquarters, forced from their car and marched into the compound at gunpoint. As they were being held inside, they saw at least one officer with his hands behind his head being taken into a barracks behind the headquarters building. But a captain told them the apparent prisoner was simply taking part `` in a simulated exercise.'' The captain, who declined to identify himself and wore no name tag, said units at the headquarters periodically conduct training exercises aimed at halting coup attempts. `` Everything is normal,'' he said. Hundreds of soldiers in battle gear surrounded the headquarters, in one of the older sections of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Residents were kept at least a block away from the compound. Reports said the coup attempt was led by the 3rd Infantry Company of the 5th Battallon from <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, bordering <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s frontier with Costa Rican. The light infantry company is known as the `` Diablos Rojos,'' or <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devils </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, Panamanian <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said today <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> was `` very angry'' following the reported coup attempt, but was still in control of the situation. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, a former colonel who has been in exile since December, said he spoke with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by telephone at about 10 a.m. `` He sounded either drunk or drugged and he was very angry,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the conversation. `` It seems -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters -RRB- still have control of the situation.'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> was second in command to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> before accusing the general of having ordered political assassinations and being involved in drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last month on narcotics trafficking charges that link him with the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He has denied the accusations. On Feb. 25, President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> announced he was dismissing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as defense chief and replacing him with Col. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Justines </PERSON>, chief of staff. <PERSON> Justines </PERSON> refused the job. The Noriega-dominate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> quickly ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and named Education Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> the new head of state. Widespread protests and general strikes followed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has been fined $ 31,700 for six violations of state health and safety rules following an investigation of a fire that destroyed an MX missile production building and killed five workers, officials said today. <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said it found three violations it characterized as willful and serious for deviations from UOSH rules. Two other alleged violations were classified as serious and one was classified as `` other than serious.'' The state agency, which released its findings today, said the cause of the Dec. 29 fire was not determined by its investigators. `` Deference is given to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigation as to the most likely causes of the fire,'' wrote <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McVey </PERSON>, UOSH administrator. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> has 30 calendar days in which to appeal the citations and civil assessments to the independent <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> planned to respond to the state charges Thursday, company spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Authorities believe the fire in building M-592 at the company's plant 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> broke out as workers were removing casting forms from the first stage of an MX missile motor <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> makes the MX missile's four stages, and also makes the space shuttle's solid-fuel rocket boosters, which failed when the Challenger blew up in January 1986. The three alleged willful and serious violations, each carrying a $ 10,000 penalty, related to omissions in following company safety procedures adopted in conformance with state rules. `` Deviations did not have written management approval; appropriate personnel protection was not provided, nor was remote control used, and equipment was not used to assure ground continuity,'' <PERSON> McVey </PERSON> wrote. The two serious violations, carrying $ 1,700 in penalties between them, related to a lack of safety requirements in management's written operating rules and practices <PERSON> McVey </PERSON> pointed out that the UOSH rules governing employee safety in explosive materials manufacturing `` requires strict employer accountability as to compliance.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> officials had fully participated in development and adoption of the rules in 1982. He added they are unique to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and have no federal equivalent. The last alleged violation, characterized as `` other than serious,'' related to the presence of an unauthorized crowbar in a restricted area.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former appointments secretary testified at his impeachment trial today that campaign contributions were a criterion, but not a major one, in making appointments to state boards and commissions. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> also testified that he did not immediately realize that two proposed appointees to the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> were recommended by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, who provided a $ 350,000 campaign loan to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. One of the three impeachment counts accuses the governor of concealing the loan. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also voted today to lengthen daily sessions in an effort to speed it up. The trial began Feb. 29, and senators have complained that the trial is moving too slowly and there might not be time to reach a verdict before <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s May 17 recall election. They voted 21-6 to add two hours of testimony a day, subject to change if the new eight-hour schedule proves too heavy. The first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor was likely to testify this afternoon as the last defense witness on the first impeachment count, said his attorney, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>. On Tuesday, a woman who claims to be the former lover of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s top police officer testified that he is a liar who had ambitions to be governor. <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> testified Tuesday that her relationship with Department of Public Safety Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> was `` intimate and personal.'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of obstructing justice by ordering him not to cooperate with an investigation of an alleged death threat against a former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide who was to testify before a grand jury about the $ 350,000 campaign loan. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, asked Tuesday about her opinion of <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s overall truthfulness, said, `` He's a liar He's corrupt, he's an egomaniac and he's power-hungry. I'm sorry, but that's the truth.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> told her in 1982 he wanted to be governor because it was `` an easy job.'' `` It seems like everything that he does is for his own pleasure and he wants people to see that he's Tarzan,'' she said. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> attending an anti-terrorism conference, and <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> declined to comment on Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s statements. When the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> director testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he said he knew her as an informant but he was not asked about any alleged sexual relationship. Prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> asked Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> only one question: `` I get the impression you do n't like Colonel <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, is that correct?'' `` At this time I'm very disgusted with him,'' she replied. In an affidavit to senators, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> claimed to have had an affair with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. The trial's presiding judge, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, disallowed testimony about the matter. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s chief justice, renewed that ruling Tuesday after a lengthy exchange in which prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> repeatedly objected to defense lawyer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>'s questioning of Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> `` Maybe I just do n't understand the rules,'' Craft protested. `` That may be a good statement,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> replied. At one point, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> believed `` if you do n't have money or a title, you're a loser.'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> commented, `` What you've just described is someone who's proud of his own achievements in life.'' Attorney <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, testified Tuesday that he believed <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> had a good professional reputation. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said he was not surprised by the allegation that then-state official <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had threatened the life of former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. At the time of the alleged Nov. 12 threat, Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was about to testify before a state grand jury regarding <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s failure to report the campaign loan. `` To me it was just <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> shooting his mouth off again,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has denied making a threat. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has acknowledged that he may have told <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with the attorney general, but the governor has insisted he was not informed there was a serious threat that involved possible witness tampering. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, testified today that the handling of the alleged threat was `` very bizarre.'' `` In my perception I had one grand jury witness, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, threaten a second grand jury witness, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>; we reported it to a third grand jury witness, the governor, who then asked a fourth grand jury witness, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, to look at it,'' <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said. He also said he did not advise <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on how to handle the situation because the governor has his own advisers, including a new chief of staff who was a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, on Feb. 5, and accused him of attempting to block the death threat probe, concealing the $ 350,000 campaign loan and misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. He faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of hiding the $ 350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached in nearly six decades. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict him.

<TEXT>
 A woman's 36-year bout of the hiccups stopped after she was given a drug to treat her newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease, a team of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> doctors said Until then, the 75-year-old woman's `` hiccup bouts were almost continuous, with rare remissions lasting a maximum of six to eight weeks,'' the doctors wrote in a letter in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. `` Even during the periods of remission, sporadic hiccups were observed. She had been hospitalized several times and had undergone a great many tests.'' The hiccups immediately stopped when she got the drug amantadine for Parkinson's disease. The doctors theorized that the disease was somehow responsible for the hiccups. The treatment was reported by Dr. J.J.M. Askenasy of <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> Hasharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. In a separate letter, Drs. <PERSON> Izidore </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lossos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> described another odd case of hiccuping, this one involving a 19-year-old woman. She complained of a two-hour bout of hiccups along with an unpleasant itching sensation in her left ear. The doctors found that both problems were caused by an ant that had crawled into her ear.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Grand Jury Deliberates on Indictment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair on Wednesday considered a prosecutor's request for an indictment charging criminal violations by key participants in the worst scandal of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The special federal grand jury that has been investigating the case nearly 14 months began deliberations after independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> made a personal appearance with several of his top assistants. Charges long have been expected against former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, his one-time aide Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and two arms dealers, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was fired from his job as a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide in late 1986, meanwhile, went to confer with his defense attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. After making his appearance, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> retired to a small office set aside for him in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Courthouse to be ready in case the grand jurors had questions about the contents of the indictment they were being asked to approve. As he left the grand jury room, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> declined to comment except to say: `` these things can take a long time'' _ an apparent reference to the panel's discussion of the proposed indictment. Other prosecutors on <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff continued to make a presentation but left the grand jury room, apparently to allow the grand jury to study the proposed indictment. They were summoned briefly to the grand jury room before the panel took a one-hour lunch break. For several weeks, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has signaled that he is prepared to bring criminal charges stemming from his investigation into the arms-for-hostages deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits from the weapons sales to the Nicraguan rebels. The diversion of nearly $ 4 million in profits from the arms sales occurred at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras. For the last two weeks, teams of prosecutors from <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office have been meeting with the grand jury, presumably to make presentation of the evidence submitted to the panel during its investigation. Marshaling of the evidence in a grand jury investigation is a common practice of prosecutors, particularly in a lengthy inquiry such as the one <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has been conducting since the panel was convened in late January 1987. Last week, former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges that he withheld information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and in 1986 by denying that members of his staff, particularly <PERSON> North </PERSON>, were helping raise private money to arm the Contras during the congressionally imposed ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also recently hired <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a former federal judge, to contest what he called legal challenges to possible prosecutions from prospective defendants who received congressional immunity for their testimony at hearings last summer. North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> both testified before the joint <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee hearings under grants of limited immunity from prosecution. The immunity prohibits <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from using any information gleaned from their testimony as evidence against them. Both are expected to claim that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> made improper use of their testimony in obtaining the indictments. To counter that claim, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has carefully placed evidence he has gathered under court seal to prove that he obtained it independently of the congressional hearings. Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to felony charges that they conspired with <PERSON> North </PERSON> to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation for the purpose of raising money for the Contras. Both are cooperating with <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation. The 1985-1986 sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were part of an effort to trade arms for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian terrorist organizations. Congressional investigators determined that of the $ 16 million in profits from the arms sales, $ 3.8 million went to the Contras when the congressional ban on direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was in effect. The administration also raised $ 34 million in donations to the Contras from foreign countries and another $ 2.7 million from private sources, according to the report of the congressional investigation.

 <PERSON> Munusamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunasekaran </PERSON> sleeps on the job, but his boss does n't mind. <PERSON> Gunasekaran </PERSON> is one of 34 volunteers hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to act as `` human bait'' to attract and catch mosquitoes as part of a program that helps keep this city of 1 million people free of malaria. The volunteers are paid between $ 120 and $ 160 a month to sleep in small huts on a bed surrounded by mosquito netting. The mosquitoes are attacted by the scent of the men inside the hut and the light from small hurricane lamps hanging by the doors, said <PERSON> Muthuthamby </PERSON> <PERSON> Balakrishnan </PERSON>, a senior assistant in the city's <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` The man who is acting as the human bait gets up from the bed, comes out of the net and catches the mosquitoes,'' <PERSON> Balakrishnan </PERSON> said. `` He shines a powerful torch -LRB- flashlight -RRB- on the mosquito and for a few moments it does not fly away. The light has this effect on it. He places a test tube over it and traps it,'' he said. In addition, eight `` bare-leg catchers'' are paid to sit outdoors in various districts of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. They roll up their trousers and allow mosquitoes to settle on their legs, where the insects are trapped. The specimens are sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which determines if any are Anopheles Maculaeus mosquitoes, the malaria carriers. If so, health department officials check the vicinity for any mosquito breeding areas and spray them with insecticide, said <PERSON> Balakrishnan </PERSON>, who has been supervising the mosquito control effort for 25 years. In addition to the men who serve as bait, the city also has mosquito traps scattered around the city. Last year, 34 Anopheles Maculaeus mosquitoes were found in eight areas of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, he said. There are no special requirements for being a mosquito catcher, although they have to be in good health for the all-night occupation. <PERSON> Gunasekaran </PERSON>, 30, says people may joke that he's being paid to sleep on the job, but actually he's able to nod off only intermittently because `` every couple of hours we have to get up, catch the mosquitoes and then lie down.'' <PERSON> Gunasekaran </PERSON>, who is married with two children and works a day job as a gardener, said he traps about 20 to 30 mosquitoes a night, but rarely are any of them the malaria-bearing variety. He has worked at the job for five years. Some of his colleagues have been at it for more than 25 years. Catchers work two shifts a night, seven days a week and on holidays. The shifts are from 6 p.m. to midnight, and midnight to 6 a.m. None of the men has caught malaria, although their blood is tested every six months as a precaution, said <PERSON> Appalasamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gangaraj </PERSON>, another public health official. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soosaipillai </PERSON>, director of the health department, said malaria is virtually non-existent in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. Only one resident was diagnosed with it last year and probably caught it while traveling outside <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Soosaipillai </PERSON> said the `` human bait'' project for controlling malaria-bearing mosquitoes was set up by the British colonial government long before Malaysian independence in 1957. Throughout <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, cases of malaria are diminishing but the disease still poses a threat. Deputy Health Minister <PERSON> Kunjambu </PERSON> <PERSON> Pathmanabhan </PERSON> said 77 percent of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> is free of malaria. Dr. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Chee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsun </PERSON>, director of the government's Vector-Borne Diseases Control, said there were 36,175 cases of malaria and 75 deaths reported last year, compared with 44,145 cases and 62 deaths in 1986, and 49,526 cases and 106 deaths in 1985. The majority of the deaths were on <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> island and involved illegal immigrants who were reluctant to seek medical attention, <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Outlook Good For Production And Service Workers, BNA Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Job prospects for both production and service workers are the brightest they have been in three years but are declining slightly for technical, professional and office workers, according to a private survey released Wednesday. Twenty-one percent of the 398 corporations and organizations surveyed said they anticipate expanding their production and service work forces from April through June. A year ago just 15 percent of the surveyed employers expected an increase in hiring. But only 19 percent of the companies surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, a private publisher of business research, said they plan to increase their technical and professional staffs, down from 21 percent for the first quarter of this year. And just 13 percent, down from 16 percent for the first quarter, said they expect their office and clerical pools to grow this spring. The greatest hiring boom for production and service workers is expected in the <LOCATION> upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the last region to recover from the 1981-82 recession. Twenty-four percent of employers there, up from 15 percent a year, said they will expand their payrolls this spring. An equal expansion in hiring of technical and professional workers is anticipated in the South. But it is offset by a decrease, from 17 percent this quarter to 13 percent in the spring, of companies in the West that plan to hire more people in those occupations. Fewer companies also anticipated layoffs this spring, except for office and clerical workers, according to the survey.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have a virtual lock on the Republican presidential nomination, but his prospects for winning the general election are far less assured, poll analysts said Wednesday. Indeed, some polls indicate that Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s all-but-vanquished Republican opponent, could be as strong or stronger as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee in the fall <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has argued that he would be more likely than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win the presidency if nominated. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has certain weaknesses vis-a-vis <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. While the flaws are not decisive, `` it certainly indicates he's not a prohibitive favorite to beat a Democrat,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. One potential problem is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failure thus far to win strong backing of independents. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swept the Republicans in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won 46 percent of the independents voting in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary, to 42 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s exit poll said. Because Republicans are a minority of the nation's electorate, `` if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to win the general election he's got to start attracting independent voters,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, chief of polling at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also has shown more potential appeal to Democrats. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll late last month said 24 percent of Democrats might consider supporting <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for president, to just 9 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> have been roughly in dead heats with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in hypothetical contests, in surveys by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 18-23, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> magazine March 10, and Newsweek March 10-11. A <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> poll March 9 also put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a tie with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; a Dole-Dukakis race was not proposed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did better in hypothetical contests against other potential Democratic nominees, and analysts said he is likely to be perceived as stronger as his primary victories mount. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the moment has the advantage of being better known than the Democrats, and that, too, is likely to change. And he may lose the bulk of undecided voters, who typically turn against an incumbent, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemm </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> polling firm. Exit polls on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> revealed `` little chinks in his armor,'' said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON>, a poll analyst for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. While 55 percent of Republican voters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was tough enough to be a good president, 24 percent said he was not and 21 percent were not sure, <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON> noted. Also, while 30 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be a very strong leader, 42 percent said somewhat strong, 16 percent said not very strong, 6 percent said not at all strong and 6 percent did n't know. Neither result showed the confidence that may be expected in such a strong front-runner's own party, <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON> said. Similarly, among the 23 percent of Republicans who said leadership was a key issue, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> News found that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> split the vote. Said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>: `` A prohibitive front-runner should be showing some leadership, particularly given the fact that he holds the second-highest office in the land.'' In another measure, 41 percent of Republican voters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not fully disclosed his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair; 32 percent said he had and 21 percent were not sure, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> found. The issue, while not key to most Republicans, could gain significance in the general election, <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that one source of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s popularity among Republicans, his closeness to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, could prove a liability with many Democratic voters in November. `` Right now to guess whether it will be a close election or not is premature,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` It is perfectly possible that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could really firm up his support and be a very strong candidate. It's equally possible the ground will move under his feet, and he'll look very vulnerable.''

<TEXT>
 A Confederate flag that sparked protests by a black legislator has been pulled down from the entrance to the state Capitol. The Confederacy's standard had flown over 14 Flags Plaza along with the flags of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the Choctaw Indian Nation and other states which once controlled what is now <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>.

It was n't clear when the flags came down as many workers at the Capitol only noticed their absence Tuesday. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said there were no plans to put the flags back until the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and various commissions decided what to do with the area to celebrate next year's centennial of the Land Run of 1889. But she said, `` I think it's probable the flags will not go up again.'' The Confederate flag prompted a vigorous protest last year by Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who asked Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> to order it removed and sought to have the state attorney general rule it illegal but was denied both times. Ms. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> would not say whether <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' protest led to the removal of the flags. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said he had not been informed that the flags were not to go back up, but he said he was `` delighted'' by their removal and did not plan any further action.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With her good looks and stylish clothes, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has given a new glamour to the image of Soviet women as she accompanies her husband on his visits to the West. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, she has shown other sides of her character _ a skill that matches her husband's in handling photographers, an eye for detail and neatness. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> for an official visit Monday. When she joined her husband at a tree-planting ceremony Tuesday, both Gorbachevs indicated they are meticulous housekeepers _ <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON>, the farmer's son, scraping every last bit of earth off the white marble surrounding the tree, and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> carefully watering each side of the small plot where the larch was planted. On Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> displayed the same attention to detail when touring a ritzy furniture store more like a Western shop than those she knows from home. At one point, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appeared to think the store might be a special closed shop, like those for the Soviet Communist elite. `` Why are there no shoppers here?'' she asked her guides. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was assured that the store was open to the general public and closed only for her visit. Through detailed questioning, however, she learned that the number of customers is dropping because <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s triple-digit inflation leaves most Belgraders little money to buy the luxury furniture and household goods the store sells. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> admitted to some trouble in getting used to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six - and seven-digit prices for everyday goods `` These millions, they kill me,'' she joked as she paraded around the store, closely examining the china, textiles, glassware, beds and sofas she was shown. She seemed equally interested in a short fashion show and, ever gracious with photographers, gladly consented to put her good looks alongside those of the models and pose with them in a hail of flashing camera lights. Her past as a lecturer in Marxism-Leninism showed through, however, in clipped, schoolmarmish questioning of the store employees who accompanied her. Her questions, delivered in a high, crisp voice, yielded a font of information about everything from credit terms to manufacturing sources. At one point, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took a determined bet with a store employee that the carpet he was showing her was not all wool. She lost, exclaiming `` 100 percent wool! I did n't think there was such a thing today.'' Picking up china, poking in refrigerators, checking mattresses and other furniture, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seemed to drink in details. Such trips doubtless help her husband to fill in his picture of the countries and cities he visits, yielding accounts of daily life he can not see while engrossed in political negotiations. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s costly clothes and prominence at her husband's side have raised criticism at home Critics note that no ordinary Soviet has the money or clout to look like her and mutter about a woman meddling in what is seen as the men's business of politics. A Soviet official, speaking privately, admitted in May before the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> arrived in the Romanian capital of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> that `` not everybody in our country agrees that she should be along.'' But, he said, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` says it helps him to have her there. Apparently, it helped a lot that she was in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>'' at the Soviet leader's 1986 summit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In public, the Gorbachevs show their affection for each other by exchanging glances and small asides. The couple, married in 1954 when both were students in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, held hands as they walked together up a long stairway leading to a monument to the unknown soldier on a hill outside <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> Monday. And at a formal dinner Tuesday night, they twice leaned across <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON>, seated between them, to chink glasses and smile warmly at each other during formal toasts.

<TEXT>
 It was `` an act of God'' that brought two love-struck bulls together with the cows next door, says a man accused of negligence for failing to keep them apart. The bulls were unexpectedly freed from their pen when a tree limb felled by a storm crushed the fence enclosing them. They headed for <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> and Blackbird, two pure-bred cows awaiting artificial insemination by a $ 770,000, prize-winning <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> bull named Broadway. Since the bulls, aged 9 and 13 months, may have beaten Broadway's time with the cows, the cows' owners were advised to wait 60 to 90 days before artificial insemination, to make sure Broadway was the father. Though this was done, the owners are suing <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, caretaker of the bulls and cows, for $ 39,000, accusing him of negligence in not keeping the guys and gals apart. <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembrook </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Pembrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> businessman, each owned a half-interest in Blackbird. <PERSON> Pembrook </PERSON> owns <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, a specialist in artificial insemination and embryo transfer techniques, contends the fence mishap, in the fall of 1986, was an `` act of God'' that could not have been prevented or foreseen. The trial began Monday before a <LOCATION> Payne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury, and testimony ended Tuesday. Closing arguments are scheduled Friday. After the artificial insemination took place, the embryos were frozen, according to testimony. <PERSON> Pembrook </PERSON> picked up the frozen embryos in October, but there was no testimony on whether the embryos had since been placed in host cows.

<HEAD>New Soviet Doctrine a Signal of Economic Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An emerging new Soviet military doctrine appears to signal <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> realization that it can not compete in a full-blown arms race and still carry out much needed economic reforms. As the Soviets debate possible force reductions, their diplomats are trying to persuade the West to scale back through arms control agreements. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, meeting in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> with his Soviet counterpart <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, says he wants <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> to explain whether the new `` reasonable sufficiency'' doctrine will mean fewer tanks, artillery and missiles facing the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and other Soviet generals are billing the new doctrine as defensive, but <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> says their formulation appears to require continued high levels of offensive capabilities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts say Soviet force reductions may not occur until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reach an agreement on cuts in conventional forces. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in 1986, proposed major conventional cuts, and the two sides are negotiating, but no agreement has been reached. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders last month urged the Kremlin-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> to cut its tank and infantry forces to the same level as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Western analysts say the Soviet bloc has a 2-1 edge. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts, however, doubt the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> intends to reduce its forces, and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday, `` If anything, their military continues to grow. They continue to modernize.'' <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Fast </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the author of books and articles on the Soviet armed forces, said of the new doctrine, `` Reasonable sufficiency is whatever you want it to mean. It satisfies both the hawks and the doves, at home and abroad.'' Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scholar, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washingon </LOCATION>, says `` the important part of reasonable sufficiency is the arms control part.'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, in a paper on the doctrine, said <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders are `` saying, in effect: To secure growth and greater national security in the long haul, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> must renounce some of its current military ambitions.'' The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> must be thinking that `` unilateral steps along this road, however, will only put the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the mercy of the West. ` We must bargain now while the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> is still ahead, and see to it that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> disarmament proceeds pari passu -LRB- in pace -RRB- with out own,' `` wrote <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>. Part of the Western confusion over the doctrine stems from differing views offered by Soviet academics. Gen.-Col. M.A <PERSON> Gareyev </PERSON>, deputy chief of the Soviet General Staff, said last year that `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is in favor of restricting military potentials within the bounds of reasonable sufficiency, so that the armed forces will be able structurally to conduct only defensive operations.'' Another Red Army officer, Col. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Semeiko </PERSON>, who comments frequently in the press, called the Soviet formulation `` truly revolutionary, since for the first time it proposed the mutual rejection by the two sides of such a type of military action as the offense, traditionally considered basic.'' As recently as 1986, <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> wrote, the Desk Military Encyclopedia of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dismissed such a defensive posture as only `` expedient when confronted with a superior military opponent, or when it was necessary to economize forces ... to accumulate a preponderance of forces for an offensive.'' Another Soviet military officer who writes frequently on doctrine, Col. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larionov </PERSON>, said last year that `` defense is the more economical method of action,'' signaling that economic, rather than purely propagandistic, motives are driving the doctrine of `` reasonable sufficiency.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials argue that cutting nuclear weapons saves little money, and that sharp reductions in conventional armies are needed to free up money for the civilian economy. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> reinforced that point at a dinner with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> on Tuesday night, telling him that nuclear arms control `` does n't save money. It costs money. We are spending $ 198 million'' for on-site inspections to verify elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles.

The <ORGANIZATION> PDP </ORGANIZATION> favors a continuation of the status quo, whereby Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens with most every right and obligation except they can not vote for president and pay no federal taxes. Thus, votes for <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcelo </PERSON> indicate a preference for statehood, and strengthen his hand against rivals within the <ORGANIZATION> NPP </ORGANIZATION>, including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Baltasar </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrada </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, also a gubernatorial candidate. Votes for <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosto </PERSON> endorse some form of political autonomy, and PDP Gov. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>. `` Everyone here knows _ and anyone in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that knows <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> politics knows _ that what's cooking ... is a confrontation between the <ORGANIZATION> PDP </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NPP </ORGANIZATION>, and not a primary of the Democratic parties,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dapena </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NPP </ORGANIZATION> mayor of <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION>, said. The contests have been heavily publicized, with both sides organizing rallies and long car calvacades, horns tooting and loudspeakers blaring, in urban housing projects and mountain villages across this lush island. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcelo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosto </PERSON> are regular guests on TV and radio talk shows, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>'s four newspapers prominently feature stories like <ORGANIZATION> NPP </ORGANIZATION> allegations of faulty voter lists and <ORGANIZATION> PDP </ORGANIZATION> fears about double-voting. One million Puerto Ricans are expected to vote Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is sending a commission to monitor its primary, citing past `` instances of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> voters casting votes in both party's primaries.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the 1980 primary. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has stated in its platform for more than a decade that it supports statehood for this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory of 3.5 million located 1,000 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The island's 51 Democratic pledged delegates will be uncommitted to any presidential candidate. There is a separate `` beauty contest'' balloting that has drawn several of the Democrats to the territory in search of, literally, a symbolic win _ the candidates were assigned symbols by lot to distinguish them on the ballot. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a square, and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a triangle, are scheduled to visit Friday.

<HEAD>School Bans Stage Play Because Of Nude Scene</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Administrators at a private <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> college say they will bring the curtain down on a student's play unless he cuts a nude scene from the final act. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, 21, learned Tuesday that administrators at <ORGANIZATION> Chapman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> have banned performances of the `` The Coloring Box,'' which he wrote and directed, unless he removes a that calls for a man and woman to walk on stage naked and wash each other's feet. Officials at the 2,000-student college, affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Disciples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said they were concerned that the scene, which had been approved by the school's communications department, would give the school a bad image. `` We recognize diversity of opinion and we support freedom of speech and creative expression, but on occasion the nature of certain performances on campus must be reviewed,'' said school spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Derloshon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, supported by a student arts group, said he plans a demonstration Monday to lobby administrators into a change of heart. `` It goes beyond the nude scene,'' the senior theater arts major said in a recent interview. `` What the college is doing is placing their morals above Constitution-protected rights It's hypocritical to allow nudity in student art classes but not in theater arts.'' The 75-minute play, <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said, centers on four people who reject social pressure and begin living their lives for themselves. The nude scene was written to symbolize their rebirth, he said. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, one of several faculty members who approved the nude scene earlier, said the decision sends students the wrong message. `` Now the nudity has become the issue rather than the writer's development,'' <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON> continued `` That's what really bothers me, this idea that it's a dirty play. It's such a narrow viewpoint.''

 <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>'s beaches will soon change color _ from brown to white _ with the help of sand imported from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. For years, people have complained about <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>'s murky water and brown, narrow beaches, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> McPheeters </PERSON>, administrator of a development called <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION>. `` What do most people think of when they think of beaches?'' he asked Tuesday. `` White sands.'' `` We ca n't do anything about the water but we sure can do something about the sand,'' he said. Within two weeks, he said, two ocean barges full of white sand are expected from <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, he said. The sand, purchased from <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> sand mines, was selected because it has the right consistency and color for building sand castles, he added. Mayor <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggeshell </PERSON> said the white beach would be a welcome addition. The development is the latest part of a multimillion-dollar project on the shores of Offatts Bayou.

<TEXT>
 Four Arabs were reported killed Wednesday, bringing the total to 100 since battles with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers began in the occupied lands Dec. 8, and Palestinians shut their cities and towns in a general strike. The strike was a message to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> must have a role in peace talks. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had ordered it in a leaflet, saying the purpose was to show there is `` no alternative to an independent state led by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, our sole representative.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said after meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that he would not revise or abandon the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> expressed `` strong reservations'' about some aspects of the plan. It does not envision <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> defended sanctions on Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. He said cutting telephone lines, banning travel and imposing curfews prevent activists from preparing attacks on Israelis. Guerrillas in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> fired several rockets into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, causing slight damage in one community, the army said. The settlement's name was withheld for security reasons but its secretary, <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zmora </PERSON>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio some residents were alarmed by `` a feeling of gradual escalation'' in attacks from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police detained an Arab-American advocate of non-violent resistance and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said he might be expelled. They said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, was accused of attending an illegal gathering. Riots swept the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION> and two nearby refugee camps 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the army and the Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Hundreds of Palestinians built roadblocks, set tires ablaze and hurled stones at soldiers, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. The army reported seven Palestinians wounded and two dead near <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION> but the press agency said there were three dead. It identified them as <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehyeh </PERSON>, 60, who died after soldiers threw tear gas into his home, and <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Alush </PERSON>, 23, both killed by gunfire. Army spokesmen confirmed the deaths of <LOCATION> Yehyeh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alush </PERSON> and said the circumstances were being investigated. They said the report of a third death was being checked. Soldiers shot 25-year-old <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamarshi </PERSON> dead in <LOCATION> Yabad </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> bank </LOCATION> village 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, hospital officials in nearby <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> reported. The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating. Fourteen other Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, hospital officials told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, at least 100 Palestinians have been killed in more than three months of `` the uprising,'' as the Arabs now call the violence, nearly all of them by Israeli bullets or beatings. The general strike paralyzed the occupied territories for the second day. Stores were closed, public transport stopped and most of the 110,000 Arabs who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed home. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has declared illegal, fiew from utility poles. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closed the <ORGANIZATION> Hebron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which serves about 100,000 Palestinians, until next week. Army officials said it violated a contract with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military government that forbids striking. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a high school audience in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> the nightly 10 p.m.-3 a.m. curfews in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were needed to `` reduce their -LRB- Arab activists' -RRB- capability to move by night, to prepare explosives ... to obstruct roads that carry workers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The Israelis have cut telephone lines connecting the occupied territories to foreign countries, forbidden travel and kept gasoline supplies from reaching the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` We will use fuller and more sweeping measures to create an atmosphere encouraging the silent majority to restrain the extremists,'' he said. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a Palestinian with homes in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is accused of attending an illegal gathering on the main road between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. He had no further details. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s lawyer, said his client was questioned about taking two foreign television crews to a women's sit-in in <LOCATION> Isawiya </LOCATION>, an Arab village incorporated into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after the 1967 war.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vowed today not to revise or abandon the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks in the face of opposition from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. As they parted after a two-hour White House session, a deadlock was apparent. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> registered his `` strong reservations'' to an international conference demanded by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to modify the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he was willing to hold direct negotiations with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet auspices. Or, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, `` I shall be ready to consider a similar proposal.'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking first in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, said `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not slice this initiative apart and not abandon it.'' He advised <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that there was `` a sense of urgency'' behind the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intiative to hold the peace conference next month. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said those parties who do not agree to hold negotiations `` need to answer to themselves and their people.'' At the same time, he said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had not directly rejected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, which also calls for negotiations on an overall settlement by December. `` There was essentially no slamming of the door on the Israeli side,'' a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told reporters afterward. As <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s talks here wind down _ he leaves Thursday _ the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said, `` We are where we expected to be.'' But he also threw cold water on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s offer to negotiate with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet auspices. The proposal was made by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> last October on a trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and subsequently rejected by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. `` Standing on its own, there would not be much point point in presenting that again,'' the official said. Despite their disagreement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> again offered assurances to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and a warning to its enemies, that `` no wedge will ever be driven between us.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> posed for pictures in the Oval Office, sitting in wingback chairs in front of the fireplace. Asked whether he was giving up on a peace plan in view of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> resistance, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` We have not yet had our meetings; we're just beginning. We're going to, I think, have a discussion on all these things.'' On the eve of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> underscored the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations would help both sides and are urgently needed. `` When it comes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not a bargainer or a broker,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> group. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a friend and an ally.'' The White House meeting came on the third day of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s four-day visit, marked so far by his opposition to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for negotiations It began with another call on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister. They will meet again on Thursday. His spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, summing up three hours of talks <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> held Tuesday with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said `` he did not give an answer. He did not say yes, he did not say no.'' But <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal to hold an international peace conference next month was `` a sticking point that has to be resolved if we are going to go ahead.'' The Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have been plagued by protests in which 96 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces in a little more than three months. The peace conference would set the stage for negotiations starting May 1 between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a mixed delegation of <LOCATION> Jordanians </LOCATION> and Palestinians to set up Palestinian self-rule in the territories for three years. In the second stage of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan, negotiations on an overall settlement of the 40-year <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict would begin by December. There the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would call on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish at least some of the territories in exchange for Arab recognition. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged Tuesday he was unable to bridge differences with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. But he said `` we feel encouraged to continue our efforts to work with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and others in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s view, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference could not play `` any positive role.'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, the Israeli spokesman, claimed that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> wants the conference to let <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s enemies `` put pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to try to bring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to agree to solutions it would not agree to in free negotiations.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> offered last October to hold Israeli-Jordanian negotiations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet `` blessing.'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> stands by the offer even though it was rejected by the king <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the Jewish group `` we will not leave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> alone to stand alone.'' `` Nor,'' the president said, `` will we acquiesce in any effort to gang up on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Peace will not be imposed by us or by anyone else. It will and must come from the genuine give-and-take of negotiations. That's what we're working to set in motion now.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had set this week as a `` deadline'' for a reply from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is still consulting with its Arab neighbors on the proposal. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> sought to reassure supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that an international conference would not dictate solutions to any side. Pressed by several congressmen on why <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had softened his opposition to Soviet participation, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said no Arab state would enter peace talks without a Soviet presence. `` They're -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- in the region, and we have to find a way to deal with them,'' he said. Meanwhile, nine <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators made public the text of a letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urging him not to subject <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism or pressure. It said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support should not be used `` as a lever to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders to adopt a policy which they see as dangerous to the national security of their country _ especially when such policy entails injecting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the peace process.'' The letter was signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator said Wednesday that next week's visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> may help clear the roadblocks in the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said the superpowers may `` at least find it easier to settle among themselves'' the issue of a simultaneous cutoff of military aid to both warring sides. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is scheduled to be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> March 20-23 to continue preparations for a superpower summit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which represents the Afghan guerrillas in the peace talks, both are demanding that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s aid to its <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> allies cease at the same time as the assistance _ mainly from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ to the insurgents fighting the Soviet-backed government. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have rejected this as interference in their domestic affairs and said the Soviet aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> can not be compared to foreign aid to insurgents. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> told reporters the aid cutoff was one of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s two main concerns that should be resolved before the signing of a peace settlement. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s other main concern is the establishment of a new Afghan government to oversee implementation of a settlement and ensure the safe return of more than 5 million Afghan refugees. For the first time, <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> spelled out in detail <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s idea for resolving the issue, saying <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and `` everyone else'' that the future government was a matter to be settled by the Afghans But he said the Afghans should be given a `` helping hand'' in forming it. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> envisaged a conference of all Afghan parties, `` including representatives of the present regime ... in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> or anywhere else,'' at an unspecified date. He said the conference could best be coordinated by U.N. Undersecretary General <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the intermediary between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the nearly 6-year-old peace talks. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was prepared to stay in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> `` as long as it takes to conclude the accords making up the peace settlement.'' Earlier, the head of the Afghan delegation, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, gave a similar pledge. He said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` sees no reason for a suspension of the talks.'' New sessions were scheduled Thursday, the second day after a Soviet-set target date for the conclusion of talks. The Soviets have offered fresh assurances, however, that they will still remove an estimated 115,000 troops two months after a settlement is signed. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979. The two chief delegates resumed trading charges through the media that the other side was stalling the negotiations. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> is creating `` artificial obstacles'' and warned that failure to reach a settlement might cause the war to spread to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> was paying `` mere lip service to peace and harmony in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> met Wednesday with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and was warned that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to stop `` artificially procrastinating'' on an end to the war, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The news agency said the discussion between <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> dealt mostly with the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> issue. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> had a meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that included a discussion on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but said it is embassy policy not to disclose details of diplomatic exchanges.

 <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> does n't have a law degree or even a bachelor's, but he does have the Democratic nod for a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the example set by another Illinoisan _ <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. `` As a matter of fact, I believe -LRB- <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> -RRB- studied law by the firelight,'' <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> said Wednesday, a day after he won a four-way Democratic primary race. `` The test, to me, seems to be what you have done after school and passed the -LRB- bar -RRB- exam.'' And <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> says there's another counterpart who went far without the kind of academic credentials now usually expected of anyone presiding over a courtroom. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't have a law degree and he was a justice on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the'40s and 50s,'' <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> said that like <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, becoming a lawyer was not easy for him. He attended <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, taking 1,200 hours of classes, but left both schools without a diploma. `` I did it at night law school for four years, and I worked 40 hours a week and I had my family to support,'' <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> recalled. The 61-year-old <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbon </PERSON> jurist began practicing law in 1956 after passing the bar exam on his third try. Since 1967, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules have required that candidates for the bar have a law-school degree before taking the test. <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> has been a <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit judge since 1975 and last fall was temporarily assigned by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear cases on the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Two of his rivals, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolker </PERSON>, made an issue of <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON>'s academic background `` Getting less than a law degree is an indication of lack of qualifications,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> dismissed the importance of his credentials for representing the 37-county district from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think, perhaps, the people may have found out the lack of a law degree was somewhat of a false issue,'' <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> himself, who never graduated from law school, once said of a legal education: `` It is but a small matter whether you read WITH anybody. Get the books and read and study them ... that is the main thing.'' Reading the law with an established attorney, a sort of apprenticeship, was an accepted form of legal training until recent decades. With all the vote in, <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> had 49,894 votes, or 33 percent; Circuit Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> had 42,245, or 28 percent; <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had 39,582, or 27 percent and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolker </PERSON> trailed with 17,428, or 12 percent. <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON>, who has the advantage of an overwhelmingly Democratic district, will face Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, 48, of the appellate court in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, in the November general election. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said he did not expect the academic credentials issue to come up in the race for the $ 93,000-a-year job. The winner will succeed retired Justice <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldenhersh </PERSON>, who resigned last September at age 73 due to poor health. The high court appointed Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, as an interim justice to serve through December. He did not seek a full 10-year term.

 A van ran off a dead-end road Wednesday and plunged into a secluded bay in a wildlife refuge, drowning three young sisters, state troopers said. The girls' mother, who was driving the van, crawled through mudflats but was in shock and unable to tell rescuers about the children. The woman, 29-year-old <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>, was reported in guarded condition at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said the dead were <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>, 2; <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 6; and <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Malissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 8. Authorities speculated that Mrs. <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> may have visited nearby <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, a popular resort area, and may have been returning to her home north of Mobile. A group of people on the beach near the road were huddled around a campfire shortly after midnight when they saw the van run into Weeks Bay.

<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 35 activists for the homeless were evicted Wednesday from an abandoned house, while supporters ran up side streets knocking over garbage cans and setting trash fires, police said. One woman was arrested and several protesters scuffled with police during the vandalism spree, which began at 6 a.m. as police removed squatters occupying a house owned by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, officers said. The activists took over the house five blocks south of campus about a week ago, breaking in through boarded windows, said university spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Debley </PERSON>. The university ordered the eviction after the city fire marshal inspected the three-story house Tuesday and declared it a fire hazard, he said. `` There were a few minor scuffles with police but the eviction itself was peaceful,'' said <PERSON> Debley </PERSON>. The eviction was carried out by university police, with <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> officers standing by. Within hours, bulldozers moved in to demolish the building, which was to be torn down to make way for student housing, <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> said. The university runs an 80-bed shelter for the homeless on campus property, <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> said. Homeless activist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, who lives in another building as a squatter, said the group would take over another house. He estimated 2,000 people live on the streets of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. The squatters, a mixture of homeless people and activists, include some members of the 10th Street Housing Collective, which staged a two-year occupation of an abandoned house owned by a bank, said <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Rexroat </PERSON>, of Mayor <PERSON> Loni </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>'s office. The group was evicted from that house two days before taking over the university building, <PERSON> Rexroat </PERSON> said. The woman arrested was being held in the city jail for malicious mischief, disturbing the police and interfering with a police officer, police said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House said Wednesday it is weighing all options `` short of invasion'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in response to a reported new Nicaraguan incursion against Contra rebel bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> had requested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to deal with the invasion. Asked whether this included a plea for military help, he replied, `` I ca n't say.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were dispatched to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to brief congressional leaders. He said they would `` review a menu of options and will probably make decisions after that.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meantime, said `` obviously we're concerned'' about the incursion reports _ confirmed by the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but neither confirmed nor denied by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But he also sidestepped questions about possible use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and diplomatic moves were being considered in response to the reports, which surfaced as the administration made fresh appeals to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for continued aid to the Contras in their battle against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. Asked whether consideration was being given to using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't comment on anything.'' He said only that officials had been `` in consultation'' with the Honduran government. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> at first told reporters `` nothing is being ruled out at this point.'' But he quickly revised that, saying: `` At this moment everything is being considered, short of invasion.'' During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with visiting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` the information we have is that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has crossed the border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' The president, who had held a series of strategy sessions with key advisers, invited several congressional leaders to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the situation, said sources who declined to be identified. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> later told reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made `` some tentative decisions about what the options are and what seems to be the most reasonable course.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said, meantime, said he could not immediately evaluate the incursion reports. `` If true, that would be a very serious matter and would introduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter the situation,'' including the willingness of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote for further aid of some kind for the rebels, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters. But he said he still does not believe support exists in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and repeated that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about a further package of purely `` humanitarian'' aid. The Honduran ambassador, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said there had been a `` penetration into Honduran territory of a number, ... definitely in the thousands, of Sandinista troops. At this moment, we are trying the utmost to obtain a clearing of the area, ... a total withdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of the Sandinista troops from our territory.'' But he said his government hoped to avoid military action. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> declined to confirm or deny that its troops entered Honduran territory but acknowledged that a major offensive was under way. `` We're looking into the reports,'' said an officer in the ministry's public relations office who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It's serious and that's why I ca n't say yes or no.'' Another ministry source had denied the incursion reports Tuesday night. Some 12,500 American military personnel are stationed in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including roughly 10,000 are located in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military manpower in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> varies from week to week, depending upon the exercises being conducted. A headquarters unit in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> coordinates the exercises has about 1,100 personnel assigned to it. Beyond that, there are about 950 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> engineers working on training exercises inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, far from the border area. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he could not be more precise about the number of Nicaraguan troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> beyond `` on the order of thousands.'' `` I hate to see unusual attention drawn to the fact of whether the exact number is 4,000, 4,200, 4,700 or 5,300,'' he said. `` The fact of the matter is, that we have a major <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> offensive under way. `` It's been described as such by the Nicaraguan government on a number of occasions now. Just yesterday, President -LRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was talking about two major offensives.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the Sandinista forces are using `` much superior firepower,'' including Soviet-supplied AN-26 aircraft, close support from artillery and rockets and MI-25 attack helicopters. Besides the operation in the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> there is a `` multi-batallion operation under way in the vicinity of Bonanza'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committed to help <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> `` preserve territorial sovereignty and national integrity. We're in very close consultation with the government of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not spell out what options were being considered, but he said `` the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be asked to consider the issue, and the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will present their views.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is looking into a published report that the Nicaraguan government failed to deposit $ 11 million it owed to the <ORGANIZATION> InterAmerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> after saying it had done so. The bank accepted <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s word, reinstated the Central American nation as a borrower in good standing and disbursed $ 11 million to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from old loans that had been withheld, according to the report in The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. `` The very next day the <ORGANIZATION> IDB </ORGANIZATION> received the bulk of the 11 million which <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had supposedly deposited in <ORGANIZATION> IDB </ORGANIZATION> accounts six days before,'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunning </PERSON> told a congressional hearing Wednesday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for international affairs, said his department had asked the bank for a copy of its report on the incident, which allegedly occurred last Nov. 11. The Times article appeared Jan. 5. `` I was n't aware of that situation, which we refer to as ` round-tripping,' and it is something that is being looked into,'' <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee on international development institutions. `` I would point out, however, that since that incident occurred, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> again immediately fell into arrears and therefore is not eligible to receive further disbursements,'' <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said. Later he added: `` The incident you mentioned ... does not appear to be isolated just to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. ... We understand that this type of ` round-tripping' is something that's been done by the bank from time to time, and you can lay it down in a way to inadequate, not tight enough management.'' <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is still refusing to make a new contribution to the bank, which is owned by 44 governments, until they agree to a new voting system that would enable the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to block loans they consider undesirable. Under the present system, borrowing countries control the votes. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government also wants changes in management. The bank now plans to lend about $ 2.5 billion a year.

 A former surgeon who faked a suicide last year after being charged with trying to strangle his estranged wife is being held without bond after surrendering to authorities, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johe </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, surrendered to District Justice <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boser </PERSON> on Tuesday, authorities said `` It came as quite a surprise,'' she said. A preliminary hearing is scheduled April 19 for <PERSON> Johe </PERSON>, who practiced at <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johe </PERSON>, 35, was arrested in June 1987 on attempted murder, aggravated assault and trespassing charges after he allegedly entered the home of his estranged wife, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Plott </PERSON> <PERSON> Johe </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> and tried to strangle her. <PERSON> Johe </PERSON> was released on $ 25,000 bond, then disappeared after leaving two suicide notes _ one at his home in <LOCATION> Ellicottville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the other in his van near <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The one found in the van last July said: `` Goodbye. I hope the water is not too cold. I guess I'll never know. <PERSON> David </PERSON>.'' His body was never found, however, and some authorities said they never believed he died. A <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> judge in December dismissed a motion that would have declared <PERSON> Johe </PERSON> dead after Mrs. <PERSON> Johe </PERSON> reported receiving unsigned Christmas cards and presents for her three children that she believed were from her husband. Last week, <PERSON> Johe </PERSON>'s father, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johe </PERSON>, confirmed that his son was alive and had called him recently. `` I believe he just got tired of running and decided to turn himself in,'' said <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> police Officer <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday one of two <ORGANIZATION> AMRAAM </ORGANIZATION> air-to-air missiles fired during a test last month missed its target. The service, in a brief statement, said the test was conducted Feb. 22 when an F-15 Eagle jet fighter fired two of the missiles against two target drones flying over the White Sands Missile Range in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` One scored a direct hit against its assigned target drone,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The other missile did not intercept its target and analysis is continuing to determine the cause of the miss.'' The test brought to 45 the number of successful trials out of 54 missile firings conducted to date. The <ORGANIZATION> AMRAAM </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air-to-Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> _ is a so-called `` smart'' missile that has been under development since 1981. It is designed to use its own small radar to home in on enemy planes without having to be guided by a pilot.

 The White House offered encouragement Tuesday for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s offer of asylum for Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and left open the possibility of not seeking his extradition on drug-trafficking charges. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` we do want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of there and a return to a civilian democratic government.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the administration has imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to force his ouster. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has said it would be willing to receive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> provided he asks for asylum and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not seek his extradition. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` we have looked with favor upon efforts by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and other countries to help solve this problem, but that's as far as we're willing to go. He acknowledged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have held talks with their counterparts in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but he refused to talk about the question of extradition. `` We simply are n't prepared to comment on those specific points at this time,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We'll pursue the legal course. There are always a lot of options that can be taken under those circumstances,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one option was a political decision not to seek extradition. Some officials see the waiving of extradition as a key to encouraging a quick departure by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> during a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with congressional leaders.

 Government radio today urged Nicaraguans to be on alert for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it was considering action against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for allegedly attacking Contra positions in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The director of state-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Caros </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadamuz </PERSON>, put out a nationwide alert calling on the people to `` maintain in a state of alert in defense of the neighborhoods, cooperatives, businesses, industries because we ca n't discount the possibility that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will invade <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in defense of his mercenaries.'' He said there was `` a direct threat from the White House that we have to take seriously.'' The radio also said unidentified airplanes were flying over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coastal </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cabezas </LOCATION>. It said the people were `` scared and expected a bomb.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was considering `` everything ... short of invasion'' after national security officials met to discuss what it said was a Nicaraguan attack on Contra rebel positions in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, about 6,000 Nicaraguan soldiers used helicopters and heavy artillery in a major offensive against Contra rebel forces. But the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today strongly denied its soldiers penetrated Honduran territory. `` We have never invaded <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and we have never invaded any neighboring country,'' said a ministry spokeswoman, Maj. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON>. `` So we totally deny those declarations made this morning by the White House.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Nicaraguan moves amounted to a `` very serious breach of regional borders.'' He said 1,500 Nicaraguan troops were already inside <LOCATION> Hondruas </LOCATION> and that 4,500 more appeared to be in a staging area to cross the border. Heavy fighting was reported throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 5th Military Region, which includes <PERSON> Boaco </PERSON>, Chontales, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebel positions. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 35 <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> fighters, seven Sandinista soldiers and one civilian had been killed in the fighting. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday that initial reports suggested the Sandinistas hoped to deliver a `` knockout blow'' to the Contras. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that the offensive was launched last Friday and intensified Monday and Tuesday. The drive occurred a week before the leftist Sandinistas were to negotiate with the U.S.-supported rebels about a cease-fire in their six-year war. Three days of talks scheduled to begin next Monday in the small southern town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, near the border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> defeated a $ 30 million aid package for food and clothing for the rebels two weeks ago, just after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid ran out. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opposed the package because it did not contain military aid. In a White House meeting Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pleaded with congressional leaders for a renewal of Contra aid, but met an icy reception from Democrats. Congressional sources, declining to be identified, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pounded the table and said, `` There are some people around this table who do n't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.'' <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening, when a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it was under way but denied Contra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where the rebels have bases. `` The army has undertaken major offensive operations ... Reports that the army has penetrated <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are not true,'' the spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. He can not be identified for security reasons. In December 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery pounded Sandinista troops who had penetrated <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to attack Contra bases, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters were brought in to ferry Honduran infantrymen to the front. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> charged at the time that up to 2,500 Sandinista troops had gone up to nine miles into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> about a week later. Contra spokesmen in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> claimed Tuesday that Sandinista troops entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in the latest offensive in pursuit of rebel forces. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>, a Honduran armed forces spokesman, said on Tuesday he had no information of Sandinista incursions into his country. `` Nevertheless, tomorrow we will probably be able to report on the situation.'' President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was watching developments closely and a government team `` is monitoring reports on the subject,'' a Honduran government source said on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the Honduran capital. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The Contras' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Tuesday, claimed the Sandinista army was carrying out `` genocidal bombardments'' in Chontales, dropping 500-and 1,000-pound bombs from helicopters. `` Many peasants had to flee for fear of being torn to pieces,'' the radio said. Contra leaders said Sandinista forces were knocking the rebels back. `` They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON>, director of the Contras' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. Sandinista military sources said the offensive involved about 6,000 troops and called it `` an important anti-insurgent operation.'' All sources spoke to the AP on condition they not be identified.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave final congressional approval Tuesday to legislation authorizing prime federal parkland in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a national monument to the 5,000 black patriots who served in the American Revolution. The voice vote by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> followed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the bill on Feb. 26.

Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the Korean War memorial, to be built on the mall that extends from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol, will be `` a fitting and long-overdue monument to the 55,000 Amricans who lost their lives in a forgotten war.'' Private sponsors say they have raised $ 2.5 million toward a goal of $ 10 million for the Korean War memorial. The black patriots monument, also expected to be built on the mall, will cost an estimated $ 4 million. Both the black patriots and the Korean War monuments previously were authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and will be built with private donations.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who commands the most feared army unit in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, said Tuesday he is not involved in drug smuggling and journalists are defaming him. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 49, last Thursday. It accused him of allowing his private airstrip near <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> to be used to smuggle drugs from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I deny everything in this affair,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said by telephone from his office in the barracks of his 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, located just behind the presidential palace. `` I am a Haitian in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. This concerns the Americans, not me.'' When asked about the indictment he denied owning or operating a landing field. `` That's a lie,'' he said, and laughed. `` I have no landing field. I'm not even an aviator.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he had not been officially informed of an indictment and declared: `` It is the newspapers that are saying that.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> said Monday that Ambassador <PERSON> Brunson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> personally told President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> of the indictment last week. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, elected Jan. 17 in voting supervised by the army, has made no public comment on the matter. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the government had not received official notification of the indictment. In the telephone interview, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said: `` There is a campaign of denigration against me. Haitians, when they want to denigrate somebody and ca n't do it in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, go abroad to do it.'' <PERSON> Haiti </PERSON> <PERSON> Progres </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> en Marche have printed banner headlines and front-page stories in the last few weeks about <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s alleged involvement with drug trafficking. The opposition weekly papers are based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and printed there. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Matin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouvelliste </PERSON>, the two <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> dailies, and all 14 radio stations except the Roman Catholic church's <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION> have refrained from reporting the indictment. One station manager said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> threatened him with violence if he broadcast the story. Western diplomats and a former army officer said it is general knowledge that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> operates a landing strip near <LOCATION> Thomazeau </LOCATION>, a village northeast of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> near the Dominican border. Asked what he would do to defend himself against charges in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said, `` Military regulations are very strict concerning that. It is up to the corps, not me, to assume my defense.'' Soldiers from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s battalion, who reinforce <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> police, were blamed for most of the attacks on civilians during anti-government protests last summer. At least 30 people were killed and 200 injured. Dessalines soldiers also were accused of protecting and even aiding thugs who roamed the streets of the capital on Nov. 29, the day of an election managed by an independent commission, killing at least 34 people and causing the election to be canceled.

 Imposing federal efficiency standards on the electrical devices that start fluorescent lights would save a massive amount of electricity, the equivalent of the power created by seven atomic plants, a congressman said Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., said a bill that he was introducing would save 7,000 megawatts by the year 2000, nearly $ 11 billion in energy costs He also said the measure would save more than $ 21 billion in power plant construction that could be avoided with the energy savings. `` The energy saved by these standards is equivalent to the energy produced by 15 large coal power plants or seven nuclear power plants,'' he said. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said his estimates came from the American Council for an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Efficient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit research group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on energy and power, said the bill would mandate energy efficiency standards for ballasts by amending the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION> passed last year That law sets standards for stoves, refrigerators and other major appliances. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have adopted similar measures on the state level. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> alone, state officials estimate that consumers will save between $ 223 million and $ 496 million by the end of the century, according to <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>. Most fluorescent lights use ballasts with an aluminum wire coil and small iron cores. Under the proposed standards, producers would have to use either copper wire and steel cores or solid state circuitry. Both types are already available. The alternative ballasts are about twice the price of the standard aluminum ballast, but they last twice as long. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said the alternative ballasts would save 10 percent to 15 percent in electricity over the traditional aluminum ballasts. There are more than 50 million ballasts sold annually, he said. Industry groups supported the legislation, saying it would simplify their business by having one nationwide standard. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Certified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the five states with their own standards have differing laws, and that other states are considering their own requirements.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that Nicaraguan troops had attacked Contra rebel positions in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and his spokesman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering `` everything ... short of invasion'' in response. The White House said the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>, asked for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance in trying to repel the Nicaraguan forces, but <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he could not say whether that request included a plea for military help. The Honduran ambassador put the number of Nicaraguan troops in his country as in the thousands, but <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> today strongly denied that its soldiers had entered Honduran territory. `` We have never invaded <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and we have never invaded any neighboring country,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` So we totally deny those declarations made this morning by the White House.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked whether he was considering any use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces, replied, `` We've been in consultation with the Honduran government but I ca n't comment on anything.'' He said that `` the information we have is that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has crossed the border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Obviously we're concerned.'' Speaking separatel, the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said that here a had been a `` penetration into Honduran territory of a number, ... definitely in the thousands, of Sandinista troops. `` At this moment, we are trying the utmost to obtain a clearing of the area, ... a total withdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of the Sandinista troops from our territory.'' But he said his government hoped to avoid military action. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his national security adviser, the secretary of state and others `` have conferred at length in the last 24 hours concerning the Nicaraguan invasion of Honduran territory.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not spell out what options were being considered, except he did say that `` the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be asked to consider the issue, and the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, will present their views.'' He said the administration no longer is thinking of working with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on an aid package to simply provide the resistance forces with food, medicine, and other supplies, but not arms. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were being dispatched to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to brief congressional leaders. He said they would `` review a menu of options and will probably make decisions after that.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he could not immediately evaluate reports that Sandinista troops had crossed into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` If true, that would be a very serious matter and would introduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter the situation,'' including the willingness of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote for further aid of some kind for the rebels, he told reporters. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he still does not believe support exists in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and repeated that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about a further package of purely `` humanitarian'' aid. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that 1,500 Nicaraguan troops were inside <LOCATION> Hondruas </LOCATION> and that an additional 4,500 appeared to be in a staging area to cross the border. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that `` all options are under consideration. At this moment, everything is being considered short of -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- invasion.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> commented one day after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and Republican congressional leaders. He failed to persuade the Democratic leaders to get behind a new package of humanitarian aid for the Contras. Congressional sources, declining to be named, said at the meeting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pounded the table and said, `` There are some people around this table who do n't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.'' Today, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` More than 1,500 Sandinista troops are now inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, attacking freedom fighter camps in an effort to destroy their remaining supplies.'' He added: `` There are nearly 4,500 Sandinista forces with strong helicopter support moving into the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which is just below the Honduran border. They've established a new base for this operation .... `` In the last several hours, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government has been in contact with the presidents of the other three democratic governments in the region,'' he said. `` We've had discussions concerning their response to this incursion and its meaning for the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> peace plan.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government today is examining its options,'' he said. When first word of the Sandinista operation came Monday night, Democratic sources in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> portrayed it as a Nicaraguan attempt to strengthen their position in advance of cease-fire talks with the Contras, scheduled to begin Monday. Today, one senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Sandinista drive appeared to be aimed at a Contra camp complex and supply depot. If the depot is knocked out, `` there will be nothing left'' of the Contra war effort, the source said. That official said that Contra commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> is in the Bocay region and may be in `` serious trouble'' because he and his forces are surrounded by Sandinista troops. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening, when a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it was under way but denied Contra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where the rebels have bases. `` The army has undertaken major offensive operations. ... Reports that the army has penetrated <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are not true,'' the spokesman said. Today, however, another official of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would neither confirm nor deny that its troops had invaded <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We're looking into the reports, ` an officer said. `` It's serious and that's why I ca n't say yes or no. Both Nicaraguans would not be identified. The Honduran <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said that 43 people had been killed in the Sandinista initiative. Heavy fighting was reported throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 5th Military Region, which includes <PERSON> Boaco </PERSON>, Chontales, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebel positions. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was peppered with questions about whether the administration was considering any use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces stationed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and in nearby areas. `` The president has said many times that he does not plan to introduce invasion forces in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We have said in the past, and it still holds true, that we do not plan to invade. ... That certainly has n't changed.'' But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said, `` At this moment, everything is being considered, short of invasion.'' But later he said `` nothing is ruled out at this point.'' `` I'm trying to be as restrained as possible,'' the spokesman said under intense questioning about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intentions. `` I'm telling you not to draw that signal -LRB- of direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement -RRB-, but we're in the midst of discussions.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that administration officials had consulted by telephone late Tuesday with congressional leaders and their representatives.

<HEAD>Reagan Stands Firm on Peace Plan Despite Shamir Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday he will not revise or abandon an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plan for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks even though <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> complained that it was `` not conducive to peace.'' Ending two hours of talks with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in apparent deadlock, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned that opponents of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal face certain consequences. `` They'll need to answer to themselves and their people as to why they've turned down a realistic and sensible plan to achieve negotiations,'' the president said, standing alongside an unsmiling <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> during a White House departure ceremony. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not specifically say `` no'' to an international peace conference demanded by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. However, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> made clear that he rejected the idea. `` I have strong reservations concerning the proposed international conference, which in my view is not conducive to peace,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> last October accepted a proposal by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to hold direct talks with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet auspices. `` I shall be ready to consider a similar proposal,'' he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has rejected the idea, holding out for a full-scale international conference, and a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said: `` Standing by itself, there would not be much point in presenting that again.'' The official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> dealt almost exclusively with differences over the international conference. He said they did not review <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s concerns about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal that it cede at least part of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> it has held since the 1967 Six-Day War in exchange for recognition by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will wrap up four days of talks Thursday with another meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` We are where we expected to be,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, since <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had hoped to convene the peace conference next month and to open negotiations May 1. He asked for a prompt reply from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs. `` We are not setting our watches on any of them,'' the senior official said. But he stressed the need to make arrangements rapidly. At the departure ceremony in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised to work to strengthen U.S.-Israeli ties during his final months in office. Without specifically mentioning the three months of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rioting and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> crackdown in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, he said the talks focused on the search for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We've seen a new sense of urgency on the part of many in the region, and a wide recognition of the reality that the status quo is unacceptable,'' the president said. He said `` the present situation is a challenge and an opportunity to move decisively to break the deadlock that has lasted far too long. I hope we will not lose this opportunity.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan `` offers a realistic and achievable way to change the relationship between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs. ... So let's be clear about several things: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not slice this initiative apart and will not abandon it.'' Explaining <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stand later, the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, `` You start pulling it apart, it's not going to be workable.'' While rejecting the notion of an international conference, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> firmly believes that those who are prepared to live with each other in peace must learn to negotiate directly with each other.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official tried to put a positive face on the talks. He said `` there was essentially no slamming of the door'' by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that the tone of the talks was excellent. Despite the apparent impasse, the president sought to reassure the hesitant <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not allow terms to be dictated at a peace conference and shared <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s distrust of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> The official paraphrased <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying that peace can not be made under violence and terrorism. `` He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is revealing its real intent: no to peace and yes to violence. We must find ways to give moderate Palestinians and other Arabs a stake in the process.''

<HEAD>Former Mayor Jane Byrne May Quit Politics after Third Straight
Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> kicked in the door of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s fabled backroom politics nearly a decade ago, unsmiling and unafraid of mixing it up with the Democratic machine's big boys. But after her third straight electoral setback, this one for clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and viewed by many political observers as the first step in a comeback bid, Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> apparently is calling it quits. `` When we say the people spoke,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said of Tuesday's primary defeat, `` they apparently shouted `` And therefore,'' she added, `` I'm very good at taking hints.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> declined to be interviewed Wednesday, when she departed <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and `` some rest and relaxation,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pecor </PERSON>, her campaign manager. But asked whether Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> does not intend to run again under any circumstances, <PERSON> Pecor </PERSON> replied, `` Where she is concerned, one should never say ` never.' `` She has demonstrated time and again that she has a very solid core of support running somewhere between 35 -LRB- percent -RRB- and 40 percent of the Democrats in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the county.'' But that was n't enough to stave off the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s upset bid in the three-way 1983 Democratic mayoral primary, and it was n't enough when she tried to avenge that loss against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year It turned out be too little again Tuesday when she lost to <PERSON> Aurelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, endorsed by the party organization that Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> once held, vise-like, in her grip. And this latest loss came in a race rich with resonance and names _ <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> `` Fast Eddie'' <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> _ that speak to the past, present and perhaps even the future of <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s quirky Democratic politics. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a former debutante with a flair for the dramatic, became the city's first woman mayor in 1979, scoring a rags-to-riches victory after campaigning against the political machine of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. She defeated the machine's candidate, then-Mayor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilandic </PERSON>, with the help of much of the city's machine-weary blacks, but later made peace with the regular Democrats. Included in that group were several aldermen Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had railed against as members of `` an evil cabal,'' most notably <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aurelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>'s father and one of the machine's most loyal servants. But she paid dearly for cozying up to the old guard, as well as for several other moves _ replacing blacks with whites on the school board, then handing out hams at public-housing projects as the 1983 election neared. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, galvanizing the black vote, turned her out of office and became the city's first black mayor. He spent the next four years retooling the party machinery to fit his needs, then became the first two-term mayor since <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> by handily beating back successive challenges from Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> last February in the primary and then <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, running as a third-party candidate, in April. After <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death in November, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> became mayor. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, saying the party under <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had become untenable, completed his move away from the Democratic organization last year. Running as a Republican, he was unopposed in Tuesday's primary for court clerk In the meantime, Ms. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, an attorney and Metropolitan Sanitary District commissioner, stepped out of her father's shadow and was welcomed into the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> camp. So much so that she may have beaten <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> in Tuesday's race on the strength of her showing among <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s blacks, who helped propel her to a 52 percent to 38 percent victory over Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> with nearly all the votes counted. Two other candidates, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a follower of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, split the rest of the vote. Ms. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> defeated Ms. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> in the 1986 Democratic primary for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> secretary of state's office, won that November by Republican <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s defeat spoiled an anticipated Byrne-Vrdolyak struggle in the fall, a match of two former titans for an obscure office both hoped would lead to bigger things.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Grows By 8.9 Percent In February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The housing industry, after staggering for two months following the October stock market crash, enjoyed a sharp 8.9 percent increase in construction activity in February, the biggest gain in more than a year, the government reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase pushed construction of single-family homes and apartments up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units last month following declines of 15.8 percent in December and 1.9 percent in January. Those back-to-back setbacks, coupled with three consecutive monthly declines in new home sales, had raised concerns because housing is often the first industry to weaken at the onset of a new recession. Economists feared that potential home buyers had grown wary following the record collapse of the stock market in October. But the February upturn in construction starts was seen as an encouraging sign that while housing activity will be slower this year, it will not weaken so much that it threatens overall economic growth. `` Housing is on the rebound,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` With interest rates at low levels and the economy growing and no recession in sight, we think we have all the ingredients in place to generate a strong spring building season.'' In another upbeat report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percent in February, leaving industrial activity 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago. Analysts said the increase, although much slower than the gains made at the end of last year, confirmed their belief that the manufacturing sector, aided by strong export demand, would provide much of the strength in the economy this year. `` The industrial production figures depict an economy that is growing less rapidly but really looks pretty healthy,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. The declines in housing starts in December and January had pushed building activity to its lowest point since the end of the last recession in December 1982. Even with the February increase, the pace of building is still 17.4 percent below where it was a year ago. However, economists predicted that construction activity would climb even more in future months as sales bounce back in response to lower mortgage rates. Fixed-rate mortgages, which have risen slightly in recent weeks, are still below 10 percent, standing at 9.96 percent, according to a nationwide survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Many economists predicted that rates would probably hold at this level, given the modest growth expected for the economy this year. `` I think we have seen the lowest rates for mortgages but I do n't believe they will rise much from where they are now,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>. The 8.9 percent rise in housing starts in February was the sharpest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986. Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economic activity, also rose sharply in February, jumping 11.5 percent to an annual rate of 1.40 million units, also the biggest monthly gain since December 1986. The strength in construction starts last month came in both the single-family and apartment sectors. Construction of single-family homes rose 9.3 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted 1.10 million units while multi-family units rose by 7.8 percent to an annual rate of 399,000 units. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said that the improvement in construction in February put housing on track with his forecasts for construction of about 1.49 million units this year, a drop of about 8 percent from the number of units built in 1987. `` We are not looking for 1988 to be a wonderful year but we are cautiously optimistic that we can get through the year without further declines,'' <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON> said. The strength was widespread in all sections of the country except the West, where starts fell 9 percent. Housing starts rose 25.6 percent in the South, 13.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and 2.7 percent in the Northeast. The report on industrial production said that the 0.2 percent February increase was the fifth in a row but the weakest advance since output fell 0.2 percent in September. February production was held back by a further drop in activity at auto plants, where manufacturers have been scaling back plans in an effort to reduce a huge backlog of unsold cars. Production in manufacturing rose 0.2 percent while output in the mining industry was down a sharp 0.8 percent, reflecting cutbacks in coal production. Output at the nation's utilities rose 0.7 percent.

 A man who attacked with gunfire and grenades from behind a tombstone killed three people and wounded 52 at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> graveside service Wednesday before enraged mourners cornered and beat him. Police arrested the man at the end of a wild chase over graves in the <ORGANIZATION> Milltown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> cemetery during which he hurled grenades at the pursuing mourners and fired until his gun jammed. A companion fled in a van parked on a nearby highway, witnesses said. Thousands of mourners screamed and dived for cover when shots shattered the silence of the cemetery as the coffins of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members killed by British soldiers in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> were being lowered into a single grave. One of the wounded was in critical condition and four were seriously wounded, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. Most victims were shot or hit by shrapnel while scrambling for cover behind gravestones. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, blamed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary groups and accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of collusion. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, aides of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she was `` shocked and appalled.'' Her government denounced the attack as `` insane and depraved.'' It appealed for calm, as did <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, church leaders and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Within hours, however, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> youths took to the streets in the ghettos of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. They shot at British soldiers and hijacking and burned buses. Black smoke hung over several neighborhoods. Police, the British government and the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> vigilante groups, all denied complicity. Police gave no immediate indication whether the badly beaten attacker was a Protestant. The largely <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is waging a guerrilla war to drive the British from Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary groups have grown up to fight it. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It's obvious it was an attack by Loyalist -LRB- Protestant -RRB- movements. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said: `` There was collusion between elements with the British Crown forces, probably the Royal Ulster Constabulary -LRB- provincial police -RRB-.'' Police said they deliberately kept away from the funeral because of assurances that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> would not turn them it into a paramilitary display. Commandos in civilian clothes killed the guerrillas, <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, on March 6. British officials said they were on a mission to bomb a public military ceremony at the fortress colony in southern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. They were buried beside dozens of other guerrillas killed in the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> battle against the British, which began in August 1969. Mourners, with a priest officiating, were lowering <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>'s flag-draped coffin into the grave when a bearded man opened fire 15 yards away from behind a gravestone. Young men yelled `` There he is! There he is!'' and the thickset gunman bolted toward the highway. His cap fell off as he reloaded his pistol, and still dodging and weaving, fired at the youths and hurled two grenades while taunting the pursuers to keep coming, witnesses said. `` I saw a young man throwing things from the back of the mourners,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who was saying prayers beside the open grave. `` I thought they were stones, but it looks as if they were grenades. He was also firing shots into the crowd. There was absolute chaos.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the attack involved two men who parked the van beside the cemetery, walked in carrying bags and cameras, and were mistaken for journalists.

 A 16-year-old science whiz has been named `` All-American Girl of the Year'' in a contest co-sponsored by ` Teen Magazine `` I have this permanent smile on my face,'' <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Stuyvesant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said after she was chosen from among five finalists. Miss <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the'80s definition of an all-American girl is `` somebody who tries her best and strives to do something out of the ordinary. It's somebody who likes to do things that are different, who takes chances with things that do n't necessarily guarantee success.'' The other finalists were composer <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedrzycki </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; astronomer-pilot <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Patience </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; athlete <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Eagle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; and pianist <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 14, of Bountiful, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

Her father, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, an accountant, and her mother, <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON>, a nurse, are immigrants from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. Her sister, <PERSON> Shanna </PERSON>, is 9. At home, she was `` encouraged to do my best from very early on. And at my school, everybody works hard. Everybody is motivated, striving to reach for the top. That kind of atmosphere encourages you to work even harder,'' she said. The prize is a $ 5,000 scholarship, which she will use next fall at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>, studying chemical engineering before going on to medical school. `` A lot of teen-agers are classified _ because of drinking and driving, pregnancies and crime _ as awful and violent,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` But plenty of teen-agers are not even recognized for accomplishments.'' Now, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will be a role model. `` I can handle it,'' she said. `` It's great.'' Noxzema Skin Cream was the other sponsor of the event.

<HEAD>Botha Meets Tutu, Nixes Clemency For Sharpeville Six</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Wednesday rejected worldwide appeals to halt the hangings of the `` <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six'' as defense lawyers launched a bid to save the condemned blacks. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, in a rare meeting with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, urged the president to heed the widespread appeals for clemency. The black Nobel Peace laureate emerged after 40 minutes in <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> office to say the president had ruled out personal intervention `` If ever there was a case for the state president to exercise his discretion, and grant clemency, this is it,'' said defense lawyer <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Diar </PERSON>. `` They are very simple, ordinary people who do not see themselves as political martyrs.'' Defense lawyers, battling for a stay of execution, filed an appeal in <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> citing new evidence. The appeal contended that a prosecution witness committed perjury after being told by police to implicate two of the defendants. The five men and one woman, convicted of a 1984 mob killing of a black township official even though no evidence showed their direct involvement, are scheduled to hang at dawn Friday at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Central Prison. Justice W.J. Human, who sentenced the six to the gallows two years ago, will consider the appeal Thursday. A finding of new evidence is the only means available to stop the hangings now that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to commute the sentence. The condemned are <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramashamola </PERSON>, 26; <PERSON> Mojalefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefatsa </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniso </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Duma </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, 28; and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokgesi </PERSON>, 30. The six were convicted by white judges of murder in connection with the September 1984 killing of black township councilor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The attorneys submitted documents Wednesday stating that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Manete </PERSON>, a black who testified anonymously during the 1984 trial, has claimed he was brutalized by police. According to the documents, <PERSON> Manete </PERSON> said officers told him to say in an affidavit that he had seen two of the defendants at the scene even though he had not. Defense lawyers tried during the trial to question Manete about his statements to his own lawyer on the alleged police action, but the court objected, citing attorney-client privilege. In documents submitted to Human on Wednesday, <PERSON> Manete </PERSON> waives those rights and the protection of anonymity. Defense lawyers said they would request a retrial if the stay of execution is granted. The planned execution of the six has drawn condemnation and calls for clemency from religious and political leaders from around the world, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and leaders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> appealed to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to spare them. The case is controversial because no evidence was produced to directly link the six to <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s death. They were convicted under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which holds they were responsible for the killing by joining a crowd of 100 people who gathered at <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s home with the intent to kill him. He was stoned and burned to death. <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> was killed in riots which began a two-year outbreak of nationwide anti-apartheid unrest that left more than 2,000 blacks dead. Activists frequently targeted black township councilors, considering them collaborators with the government.

<HEAD>Tiny Town to Keep Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAND VIEW, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials who considered going out of business to avoid road maintenance costs have decided the cost of not having a town government could be much higher. Expected development at the gateway to adjacent Voyageurs National Park requires a government, with its planning and zoning powers, the officials decided. `` We're never going to have the kind of crowds they have at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, Yosemite or Glacier, but the traffic's going to increase,'' Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We're going to get some development and we're going to have to have planning to control it.'' The opening last summer of the national park's visitor center spurred the beginnings of new development, including a recently built mobile home park and plans for a condominium project. Officials hope to stay ahead of any development by finishing a comprehensive plan within a year, the mayor said. Officials also were swayed by residents of this northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town of 101 people, who opposed the plan just as they had a similar proposal in 1984. Officials hoped to pass their road maintenance costs on to <LOCATION> Koochiching </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> by dissolving the government. Improvement of the town's five miles of mostly gravel roads was estimated to cost as much as $ 200,000, but the town could barely afford its $ 8,000 maintenance budget.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> senator called for a temporary ban on fishing in part of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that 15 foreign vessels have been detected fishing illegally in Alaskan waters over the past 18 months. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said the vessels did not include the seven Japanese trawlers videotaped by American fishermen in Janaury nor six Polish vessels spotted by a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plane in February. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said it was impossible to catch any of the ships spotted by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> planes because they were long gone before a cutter could arrive on the scene, but information on the sightings was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't cite them from an aircraft. You need ships to do the actual enforcement,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told reporters, adding the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has two ships to patrol the 800,000-square mile <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing zone off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> was among the dozen witnesses that testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> about illegal fishing in American waters and possible overfishing in an area of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> known as the `` doughnut hole.'' <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a committee member, said he would introduce a resolution calling on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> to open talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about closing the `` doughnut hole'' to all fishing until scientists complete studies of the area. Other witnesses told the committee: _ Evdience in a 1982-1983 court case showed the existence of a `` master plan by the Japanese fishing fleet in Alaskan waters to evade enforcement vessels and manipulate catch records. _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> revoked the licenses of the captains of several of its fishing boats in April 1987 after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spotted the vessels fishing in American waters _ Overfishing by foreign fleets in the international waters off the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> may ultimately affect the fish harvest by domestic fishermen in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zone In addition, committee staff released a letter from <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Shima </PERSON>, councillor of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, that said reports of illegal fishing in the American zone were `` vastly exaggerated.'' The letter to Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, committee chairman, also called for `` multilateral talks'' about the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fishery. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was reviewing the legal implications of such a closure. The catch by fishing vessels from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 4,500-square-mile `` doughnut hole'' has risen from about 200,000 metric tons in 1984 over 1 million metric tons in 1987.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Wednesday that the first formal talks between the superpower defense secretaries were productive and friendly, despite the raising of sensitive issues by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, discussed strategic nuclear weapons, the implementation of the superpower treaty to eliminate medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles and the size of their respective armed forces, said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> met privately with only their translators present for 10 minutes at the opening of the afternoon session, at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and emerged quiet and grim. Neither side would comment on the private session. Earlier, the mood had appeared jovial, although <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> raised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that the Soviets violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty by building a phased-array radar far from the Soviet border in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The pact requires such radars to be along the border. The talks are scheduled to end Thursday. `` The tone has been very positive and cooperative throughout,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for public affairs. `` We are pleased with the way things are going.'' During the afternoon session, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> about `` dangerous activities,'' such as the physical contact between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet ships in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> last month and the fatal shooting of Army Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> by a Soviet soldier three years ago in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said the Soviet ships intentionally bumped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said earlier he would seek a Soviet apology for the slaying of <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and try to work out new guidelines to prevent friction between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet ground, air and naval forces. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozdniakov </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation would not comment on the talks until <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and an aide, Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, address a news conference Thursday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was also to give a full version of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position at a news conference Thursday. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> opened the formal talks Wednesday on a light note, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Gesturing around the second-floor conference room of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> `` commented that -LRB- it -RRB- ... was a very small room, and said there is a saying in Russian that although we have close quarters, we should n't quarrel.'' `` Everyone got a laugh out of that,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Reporters and photographers were allowed briefly into the rooms where the conferences and meals were held but were ushered out as talks began. `` The main point that Mr. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> made in the beginning was that he wanted to have useful discussions without having the pressure of negotiations ... to arrive at some sort of agreement,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The defense ministers faced each other across a long table, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> flanked by <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> and a translator, and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> by a translator and <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, a top Soviet arms control spokesman. Before leaving <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said he was `` prepared to discuss issues of preventing incidents between the armed forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the U.S.S.R.'' And he said he hoped for `` a frank, constructive discussion'' of arms control issues including strategic arms, nuclear testing, chemical and conventional weapons.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has failed to `` deal seriously'' with issues that need to be resolved for a settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Wednesday. In response to reporters' questions, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> reacted to a Soviet announcement blaming `` procrastination and delay'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s inability to meet a March 15 deadline for agreement on a withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets had said that if the agreement was reached in United Nations-sponsored talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by that date, it could begin the pullout on May 15. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in reponse, `` The March 15 target date was an artificial and arbitrary date put forward by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> knows full well that an agreement can not be reached without their commitment to a complete withdrawal in the context of a safeguarded and comprehensive settlement. `` We're disappointed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has chosen to make a public issue out of the arbitrary date rather than deal seriously with the issues which remain to be resolved before the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> process can be concluded.'' Still to be settled, he said, are precise details of the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops and the way the Afghan government will be organized after the Soviets leave. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must also reach an understanding about how they will cease aid to their clients in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ the Soviet-backed government and the U.S.-backed resistance forces, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to aid the Afghan rebels as long as the Soviets assist the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. The Soviets have objected to this condition on grounds the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no right to tell <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> it can not support a legitimate government, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said the Afghan government is merely a `` faction'' in what is essentially a civil war.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is sending tax bills averaging $ 4,000 to thousands of civilian employees of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military who work abroad. As many as 40,000 of these civilians work in military commissaries and recreation facilities. They are known as NAF employees because they are paid out of non-appropriated funds _ typically from the revenues of those facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said the employees may owe as much as $ 30 million in back taxes because they wrongly claimed the foreign-income exclusion, which allows Americans working abroad to exempt up to $ 70,000 a year from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes. This benefit is not available to government employees, but many NAF workers insist they are not government employees because of the source of their paychecks. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has rejected that distinction since 1954, but said taxpayers who disagree may appeal.

 An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cutter Vigilant escorted the 465-foot ship, the Scandinavian Star, as a precaution, according to Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> navy to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. There were no injuries from the fire, but a 71-year-old <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> man who suffered a heart attack was in stable condition and on his way home aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane. A second person who suffered a spinal cord injury was also evacuated with the heart attack victim, but <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said that injury also was apparently not related to the fire. The ship was expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> late Wednesday or Thursday. The 449 passengers will be flown to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON>, spokesman for the ship's owner, <ORGANIZATION> SeaEscape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Scandinavian Star was on a 3-day cruise to <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and was returning to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> when the fire broke out about 1 a.m. EST Wednesday, she said. The crew sealed off the engine room and pumped in carbon dioxide to put out the fire. `` They used all their CO2 and closed off the engine room,'' said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. `` Then they requested more assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.'' The fire was already extinguished when the Vigilant arrived about 10 a.m., he added. Ms. <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON> said the company did not know what sparked the fire. `` It will take a week before we know the cause and the extent of the damage,'' said Ms. <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON>. In August 1984, a fire struck the Star's sister ship, the Scandinavian Sun, in the port of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, killing a passenger and a crewman. `` I feel they are two totally different incidents that are in no way related,'' said Ms. DeChello. She said the cruise line was inspected by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and rigorously enforced all safety rules. Wednesday's fire occurred as the Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off <LOCATION> Isla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mujeres </LOCATION>, a Mexican island north of the tourist resort <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials have agreed to pay $ 166,000 to the family of a 5-year-old boy who was arrested at his home one night, taken to jail, informed of his rights and interrogated about vandalism at a construction site. The settlement came Monday, when a trial was to have begun in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the family's lawsuit against several officials. The county also will pay attorneys' fees. The settlement will be paid by the county's insurance company over 21 years. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, now 9, began having nightmares, visions of the devil and fears of dying soon after the incident, said his mother, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The boy has been seeing a psychiatrist, she said. `` He knows he was done wrong, and this is to set things straight,'' she said. `` Maybe knowing this is all over, there will be a sense of relief.'' The family sued former <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prater </PERSON>, now a highway patrolman; former <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, now city judge in <LOCATION> McMinnville </LOCATION>; the county sheriff; and the county executive.

Ms. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said she was kept waiting for about 30 minutes before she was allowed to see her son. `` We think the sum paid to <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> ... compensates <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> for the damage done to him and the horrible nightmare he has lived through,'' said the family's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Galligan </PERSON>.

 No individual contracts will be signed during the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike, meaning the `` Tonight Show'' and other daily programs will get no new material until the walkout ends, the guild announced Wednesday. The vote by the guild council reverses the position taken in earlier strikes, when individual waivers were approved for certain programs, including <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s `` Tonight Show.'' The stance also reiterates the guild position that none of its writers will work on next month's Academy Awards broadcast. `` The council has decided to table all consideration of independent contracts until a future time,'' said <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement released after the vote.

<HEAD>Output Edges Up 0.2 Percent In February</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production edged up 0.2 percent in February as reductions in output at auto factories and coal mines offset gains in other areas, the government reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said that the February advance, which followed a 0.3 percent January gain, was the poorest showing since output actually declined by 0.2 percent in September. But private economists said the gains, even at a much slower pace, represented good news for the economy, especially given fears that production would have to be cut back sharply in the early part of 1988 in order to work off high levels of unsold goods. `` There is nothing here that signals anything dangerous for the economy,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are slowing down, but we are not slowing all that much.'' Industrial output had surged ahead with monthly increases of 1.1 percent in October and 0.5 percent in both November and December. However, much of that production went into inventories of unsold goods as consumer spending fell during the final three months of the year. Economists had worried that factories would cut back production so much in the early part of 1988 that it could topple the country into a recession. But recent business statistics, including the continued advances in production, rising consumer spending and strong gains in employment, have eased those fears. `` The industrial production figures depict an economy that is growing less rapidly but really looks pretty healthy,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers have enjoyed a significant rebound in output over the past year as the weaker dollar has boosted export sales. Forecasts of continued economic growth this year are relying heavily on those advances to cntinue. <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON> said a recent survey of the association's members found that a significant 20 percent of the companies were looking forward to higher sales this year. `` They see a lot of strength in their markets and very little probability of a recession,'' he said. The February increase included a 0.2 percent rise in production at manufacturing plants, identical to the gain in January. Auto production fell 0.9 percent in February and now stands 8.5 percent below where it was in October. The output of passenger cars was 6.1 million units at an annual rate, a small improvement over January, but this was offset by a drop in production of light trucks. Factories making durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, saw output rise by 0.2 percent last month while output at plants making nondurable goods edged up 0.1 percent. Output in the mining industry dropped 0.8 percent in February, the third consecutive monthly decline. The setback last month was blamed on a drop in coal production. Output at the nation's utilities rose 0.7 percent in February following a 1.8 percent January increase. The various changes left industrial production at 134.4 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

 Filming a documentary inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not occur without omnipresent government officials, state-selected interviewees and limited access to certain areas. Despite the restrictions, executive producer <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON> said he did n't believe his seven-hour documentary, `` Portrait of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' was compromised. Many of the Soviets who appear in the film, to be shown in installments on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday on <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s SuperStation <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, hand-picked by the government to appear in the film Officials from <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>, the state broadcasting committee, accompanied his crews on nearly every shoot. `` At the end, we had to rely on our own judgment,'' said <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON>. `` And you also see the pictures. You can say anything you want over pictures, but the pictures _ what's going on the frame _ do n't lie. Nevertheless, the result is a flattering depiction of life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ an official portrait, beautifully photographed, showing only the occasional wart. The series does mention the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s problems, but only those that have been raised in the state-controlled media: bureaucratic sluggishness, shoddy workmanship, complaints about consumer goods and housing. Larger problems are inexplicably absent, given the briefest of mentions, or left for viewers to discern for themselves. These include the struggles over Jewish emigration and human rights, the explosive nature of the nation's more than 100 nationalities, the issue of who really wields <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> power, and the massive military budget and the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` I think the films do look to some degree pro-Soviet,'' <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think that our intention was for certain aspects of it to look pro-Soviet. Not pro-Soviet government, but pro-Soviet people.'' The first episode, which is about the ethnic Russians, is fairly typical. There is poet <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON>, the one-time rebel who is now part of the establishment, reading a few lines from his epic work about the Holocaust, `` <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON>.'' That's the only reference to anti-Semitism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the entire seven hours. <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON>, who is of Russian extraction and Jewish, said he could not `` in good conscience'' overlook the problems of Soviet Jewry, but he added that `` it's a much more complicated story than can be done in this kind of survey piece. It's a story that deserves its own hour. `` So to the extent that we ignored Jewish emigration, we could not ignore the fact that anti-Semitism existed and exists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It is a fact of life. You got ta mention it. We did,'' he said. What gets more than a mention is music and dancing. There's dancing by <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> ballerinas and Russians dressed as <ORGANIZATION> Cossacks </ORGANIZATION>; by teen-agers in discos and old men straight from a yogurt commercial; by the Georgian state dance troupe and bemedaled <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veterans. So much foot-stomping and high-kicking is in the series that some viewers may get the impression the biggest name in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is n't <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> or <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> Danskin </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON>, who also did the upbeat `` Portrait of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' series for <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, said he wanted to draw in the general audience with the music and dance, then give viewers an understanding of the Soviet lifestyle, politics and economy. Such an overemphasis on dance weakened the segment that profiled the peoples of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON> said. One troubling part comes in the episode on central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, in which an official involved in the restoration of mosques is allowed to deliver the statement: `` Times change. Islam is not so popular now.'' The documentary allows the statement to go unchallenged, even though there are 45 million Moslems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ 16 percent of the population _ and many practice their faith regularly despite Kremlin oppression. <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON> replied that `` our perception was ... the general consensus seems to be that <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> is a mile wide and an inch deep, rather than a mile deep and an inch wide. ... So, we could n't find a way to challenge it, essentially.'' The strongest of the segments by far is the sixth hour, a moving piece on how World War II affected the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miskin </PERSON> does a good job of blending historic war footage and poignant interviews with elderly widows and veterans. Other episodes look at life in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics. The final hour summarizes the series and features a lot of footage from the Goodwill Games, the international sports competition that <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> conceived with the Soviets.

 A federal grand jury today indicted former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and two arms dealers on conspiracy charges in the diversion of Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The long-awaited 23-count indictment _ which in addition to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> also named retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> _ culminated a 14-month grand jury investigation into the arms-for-hostages deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of funds to the Contras. The grand jury said the four men `` deceitfully and without legal authorization'' organized, directed and concealed `` a program to continue funding of and logistical and other support for military and paramilitary operations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by the Contras'' at a time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law barred such action. The four defrauded the government `` by deceitfully exploiting for their own purposes'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` rather than pursuing solely the specified governmental objectives of the initiative, including the release of Americans being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the grand jury said One count said the defendants embezzled and converted to their own use proceeds generated by the weapons sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It was reported in the indictment that the arms sales generated approximately $ 30 million, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was paid only $ 12.2 million for the weapons. The indictment stated the conspiracy began in late spring or early summer of 1985 and continued through at least December 1986. The central conspiracy count charges that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> `` together with others known and unknown'' conspired to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by obstructing lawful government functions. The indictment variously charged the defendants with conspiracy, theft of government property, obstruction of justice, false statements, falsification, destruction and removal of documents. The indictment said the conspiracy deprived the government `` of the honest and faithful services of employees'' by using the positions of <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> to generate funds for <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. North was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, making false statements, obstructing the presidential inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair in November 1986, and concealing, falsifying or destroying official documents. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was named in two counts of obstructing a congressional inquiry and two other counts of false statements. The three counts in which all four were charged _ conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and commit offenses against the government, theft of government property and wire fraud arising from the diversion of the arms sale proceeds _ carry together maximum penalties of 25 years' imprisonment. Each charge carries a maximum fine of $ 250,000. Each of the obstruction and false statement charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> carries a five-year sentence and $ 250,000 fine. The destruction of documents charge against <PERSON> North </PERSON> carries a three-year term. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, among other things, were charged with conspiracy to pay illegal gratuities to <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his family to further the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> so that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> `` would continue to receive opportunities for substantial revenues and profits'' from `` lucrative activities referred to them by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and facilitated by him.'' This charge listed a series of two payments totaling $ 16,000 to security expert, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinette </PERSON>, who installed a security system at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s home in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The indictment also charged that <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> created an investment account containing $ 200,000 in a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank for the financial benefit of the North family. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> were also charged with offering an illegal gratuity to North in return for his support of the private supply network for the Contras and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales. North was charged with receipt of an illegal gratuity stemming from the installation of the security system. The charge carries a two-year sentence and a $ 250,000 fine. North was also charged with pocketing at least $ 4,300 of the $ 90,000 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. The charge alleged that <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> had given the traveler's checks to North for efforts to help release <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and to help support the Contras. North was also charged with conspiracy to defraud the government in connection with the use of a tax-exempt foundation that raised several million dollars in private donations to help arm the Contras. Two conservative fund-raisers, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, pleaded guilty last spring to the same charge and identified <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a co-conspirator. Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and several of his top prosecutors made a final presentation to the panel. Last week, former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he withheld information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and in 1986 about covert administration efforts to help the Contras during the ban on direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. The 1985-1986 sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were part of an effort to trade arms for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian terrorist organizations. Congressional investigators determined that of the $ 16 million in profits from the arms sales, $ 3.8 million went to the Contras when the congressional ban on direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was in effect.

<HEAD>Contras Issue Statement Calling Sandinistas Totalitarian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nicaraguan rebels on Tuesday accused the Sandinistas of being totalitarian for refusing to allow opposition political parties to be represented at cease-fire talks planned for next week. Presidential press spokesman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said Monday night that the leftist government vetoed the rebel request last week. `` One of the reasons is space,'' <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said. `` There's just not room for a mountain of people.'' The first face-to-face talks in Nicaraguan territory between the government and rebels, known as Contras, are set to begin Monday at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, a border post near the Costa Rican border. The meeting had been set for last week, but the government canceled it after the Contras at the last minute insisted on a preliminary meeting to work out the topics for discussion. The rebels backed off that demand and both sides agreed to an open agenda. One issue the Contras want to include in the discussions is a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo that calls for political amnesty and a revision of the military draft law, among other things. The rebel delegation will be headed by its top political leader, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. The Sandinistas are insisting that the talks center only on the mechanics of working out a cease-fire in line with a regional peace plan the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents signed last August. The government group will be led by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. A Contra statement Tuesday said Nicaraguan Resistance, as the rebels are formally called, `` puts special importance and utility on the participation by the respresentatives of the internal opposition in the talks, considering its protaganist role in the Nicaraguan conflict and its participation in a national solution to the national conflict.'' The rebel communique, read over the telephone to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said the rejection of the presence of opposition party members as well as the dismissal of the cardinal as mediator of the negotiations confirmed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' `` totalitarian tendencies.'' President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on March 2 said <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s mediation no longer would be needed because the talks would be direct. The move was seen here as retaliation for the cardinal's proposal, which included political themes that the government said it would not discuss. President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Tuesday said he did not `` discount that at the last minute the mercenary forces will come up with pretexts so the meeting would not take place.'' An esimtabed 50,000 people have been killed and wounded in the war that has continued for more than six years. President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also proposed Monday the renewal of talks with the internal political opposition, also a condition of the peace plan. Those talks broke off last December when the political parties insisted on discussing a change in the constitution. The peace outline was signed in August by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. It seeks to end wars here, in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. It calls for cease-fires, political amnesties, democratic reforms and an end to logistic or strategic support for insurgencies.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> certified almost $ 3.5 million in new federal matching funds on Wednesday for 11 presidential candidates, including nearly $ 900,000 for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> whose <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign is winding down. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued to lead the Democratic money race, qualifying for more than $ 600,000 in new matching funds and raising his matching total to more than twice that of his competitors for his party's nomination. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has a big lead in the Republican contest, got in line for a new quarter of a million dollars in federal funds, keeping his edge in the category. In all, the new funds raise the total certified thus far for 14 candidates to $ 45.44 million. Presidential candidates qualify for matching funds by raising at least $ 5,000 in individual contributions of $ 250 or less in at least 20 states. After qualifying, every individual contribution of $ 250 or less is matched dollar-for-dollar by federal funds. The money comes from the voluntary $ 1 checkoff on federal tax returns. Candidates lose eligibility for matching funds for new contributions by withdrawing from the race or by failing to win at least 10 percent of the vote in two consecutive primaries in which they compete. Here are the Republican presidential hopefuls, the amount of new money certified Wednesday and the total certified thus far: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, $ 247,118.92, $ 6,859,448.66.

 At least 10 firefighters have become ill after battling a weekend fire that destroyed a warehouse containing thousands of chemicals, authorities said Wednesday. Several residents of a nearby mobile home park also reported rashes and other adverse health effects after Saturday night's fire in the town of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, which was the worst accident involving hazardous materials in state history. `` Until we take a look at specifically what compounds were involved, it's difficult to evaluate the seriousness of the health implications,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Strohm </PERSON>, deputy director of the state Division of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. He was unaware of anyone being hospitalized. State Fire Marshal <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> said some of the 75 to 80 firefighters called in to extinguish the fire have reported nausea, tightness in their chests and other symptoms. <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION>'s fire chief ordered his firefighters to go to a hospital for blood tests _ and the chief himself was n't feeling well <PERSON> Strohm </PERSON> estimated that 10 to 14 firefighters have fallen ill. He said the state became aware of the illnesses Tuesday. He said he was not aware of any new illnesses since then. The firedestroyed an 8,000-square-foot warehouse of the Aesar Division of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthey </PERSON>, an international precious metals company with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Malvern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthey </PERSON> officials did not immediately return a telephone message Wednesday afternoon The warehouse contained about 3,000 chemicals, including heavy metals and inorganic chemicals, the company said in a statement. Officials said the fire caused millions of dollars in damages and will cost millions more to clean up. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthey </PERSON> has hired <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, to conduct the cleanup. Federal and state investigators on Wednesday continued trying to determine the cause of the fire. <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> said investigators from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> believe it was accidental. Another fire broke out in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> at the same time Saturday night, at an abandoned lumber yard. That fire caused an estimated $ 500,000 damages. <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> said its cause also remains unknown. About 80 residents of a trailer park were evacuated when wind shifted and blew a plume from the chemical fire in their direction. Fearing that radioactive materials could have been stored in the warehouse, some firefighters were tested for radiation exposure but the tests were negative. Officials from the stalled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant provided testing assistance. <PERSON> Strohm </PERSON> said determining possible health risks from the warehouse fire is difficult because some of the chemicals' properties may have changed when mixed with each other and with water and when they burned. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthey </PERSON>'s manager for environmental affairs, said Clean Harbors workers have finished cleaning the warehouse parking lot and are building a temporary cover over the fire site to prevent any precipitation from seeping through. State hazardous-waste officials have said they are conducting laboratory tests of the runoff but have not received results.

 The Democratic presidential race was as scrambled as the Republican contest was clear Wednesday after Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> victory enhanced the chances the Democrats would met this summer without an obvious nominee On the Republican side, the biggest question appeared to be merely whether _ or when _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rivals, trounced in primary after primary, would drop out. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, donning his leader-at-work mantle, lunched with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and played dinner host to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> while savoring his 55 percent majority over <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 36 percent and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s 7 percent in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, the one that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> once said would start his turnaround. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tended business in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and pondered his future. In the face of defeat, he met with supporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` They're all very friendly, very positive, very upbeat, saying ` Hang in there,''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a big loser Tuesday, went home saying he would have to scale back his effort. He has spent within $ 2 million of the $ 27 million allowed by law for the primaries. Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> signaled it was time for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race to end. He said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> should `` start thinking past the convention and start thinking about November'' and the need to win the White House. But among the Democrats, the talk was of a brokered convention, which <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says is inevitable, and of the steps that some party leaders said must be taken to prevent so publicly divisive an event this summer. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, aglow in the winner's circle at last, said the nomination in a deadlocked convention could easily come to him because `` I'm probably the second choice of as many people as anyone else. At the same time, he all but conceded the next big bloc of delegates _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 138, to be awarded in a primary March 26 _ and concentrated on another state he thought he could win, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, on April 5. Home-state voters pumped up <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s political adrenaline with his 43 percent showing in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 31 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 17 percent and a weak 5 percent for <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and 2 percent for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> conceded he still must prove himself. `` I have to win outside the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, `` and I will.'' He flew directly to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and told reporters, `` You are going to be seeing a lot of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>.'' But the debate among Democrats was whether they should search for a formula to avoid a deadlocked convention. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, the Democratic national chairman, has proposed a meeting after the primaries at which party leaders and the candidates would close ranks around the front-runner. He said a brawl at the convention would damage the Democrats' chances in the election. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, often pictured as the beneficiary of a brokered convention, seconded <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s motion. `` I think it would be a mistake to go to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, have a divisive convention, have a contention over a canddidate, have deals cut practically in public,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would attend a post-primary season summit, but only to talk about fair play and fair rules at the July convention. `` My base of support is broader than any other candidate,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, contending the nomination could go to him outright. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, acknowledging he wo n't be the front-runner, said there was nothing wrong in the image of a convention deal selecting the nominee. `` Brokered conventions produced <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' he said. `` We did n't do too badly for this country in those brokered conventions.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> struck an underdog posture, saying `` the odds are against me here in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' `` They say I'm the underdog. I like being the underdog because the underdog usually does well,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman said he would duplicate a campaign gimmick that drew publicity just before <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s long-ago caucuses: several dozen of his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues will stump <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for him on Friday.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that Nicaraguan troops had attacked Contra rebel positions in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and officials said he is considering sending the 82nd Airborne in response. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the use of the 82nd Airborne, based in Ft.. <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was one of a `` few options'' being considered by the administration to confront the new situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> However, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, asked on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> whether any military action was being taken in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said, `` That is absolutely not true ...'' `` The president has made no decisions,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` He is identifying his options. He has not acted on them. We are keeping very close touch with the situation. It is a fluid and developing situation.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> briefed congressional leaders for more than an hour on what <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called `` an incursion'' by Sandinista forces into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to eliminate Contra supply locations in that country. `` It is clear the Sandinistas ... have crossed the border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and are mounting a major offensive,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The outcome is uncertain.'' The White House said the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>, asked for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance in trying to repel the Nicaraguan forces, but <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he could not say whether that request included a plea for military help. The Honduran ambassador put the number of Nicaraguan troops in his country as in the thousands, but <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> today strongly denied that its soldiers had entered Honduran territory. `` We have never invaded <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and we have never invaded any neighboring country,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` So we totally deny those declarations made this morning by the White House.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked whether he was considering any use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces, replied, `` We've been in consultation with the Honduran government but I ca n't comment on anything.'' He said that `` the information we have is that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has crossed the border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Obviously we're concerned.'' Speaking separatel, the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said that here a had been a `` penetration into Honduran territory of a number, ... definitely in the thousands, of Sandinista troops. `` At this moment, we are trying the utmost to obtain a clearing of the area, ... a total withdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of the Sandinista troops from our territory.'' But he said his government hoped to avoid military action. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his national security adviser, the secretary of state and others `` have conferred at length in the last 24 hours concerning the Nicaraguan invasion of Honduran territory.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not spell out what options were being considered, except he did say that `` the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be asked to consider the issue, and the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, will present their views.'' He said the administration no longer is thinking of working with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on an aid package to simply provide the resistance forces with food, medicine, and other supplies, but not arms. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he could not immediately evaluate reports that Sandinista troops had crossed into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` If true, that would be a very serious matter and would introduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter the situation,'' including the willingness of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote for further aid of some kind for the rebels, he told reporters. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he still does not believe support exists in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and repeated that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about a further package of purely `` humanitarian'' aid. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that 1,500 Nicaraguan troops were inside <LOCATION> Hondruas </LOCATION> and that an additional 4,500 appeared to be in a staging area to cross the border. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that `` all options are under consideration. At this moment, everything is being considered short of -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- invasion.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> commented one day after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and Republican congressional leaders. He failed to persuade the Democratic leaders to get behind a new package of humanitarian aid for the Contras. Congressional sources, declining to be named, said at the meeting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pounded the table and said, `` There are some people around this table who do n't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.'' Today, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` More than 1,500 Sandinista troops are now inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, attacking freedom fighter camps in an effort to destroy their remaining supplies.'' He added: `` There are nearly 4,500 Sandinista forces with strong helicopter support moving into the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which is just below the Honduran border. They've established a new base for this operation .... `` In the last several hours, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government has been in contact with the presidents of the other three democratic governments in the region,'' he said. `` We've had discussions concerning their response to this incursion and its meaning for the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> peace plan.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government today is examining its options,'' he said. When first word of the Sandinista operation came Monday night, Democratic sources in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> portrayed it as a Nicaraguan attempt to strengthen their position in advance of cease-fire talks with the Contras, scheduled to begin Monday. Today, one senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Sandinista drive appeared to be aimed at a Contra camp complex and supply depot. If the depot is knocked out, `` there will be nothing left'' of the Contra war effort, the source said. That official said that Contra commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> is in the Bocay region and may be in `` serious trouble'' because he and his forces are surrounded by Sandinista troops. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening, when a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it was under way but denied Contra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where the rebels have bases. `` The army has undertaken major offensive operations. ... Reports that the army has penetrated <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are not true,'' the spokesman said. Today, however, another official of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would neither confirm nor deny that its troops had invaded <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We're looking into the reports, ` an officer said. `` It's serious and that's why I ca n't say yes or no. Both Nicaraguans would not be identified. The Honduran <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said that 43 people had been killed in the Sandinista initiative. Heavy fighting was reported throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 5th Military Region, which includes <PERSON> Boaco </PERSON>, Chontales, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebel positions. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was peppered with questions about whether the administration was considering any use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces stationed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and in nearby areas. `` The president has said many times that he does not plan to introduce invasion forces in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We have said in the past, and it still holds true, that we do not plan to invade. ... That certainly has n't changed.'' But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said, `` At this moment, everything is being considered, short of invasion.'' But later he said `` nothing is ruled out at this point.'' `` I'm trying to be as restrained as possible,'' the spokesman said under intense questioning about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intentions. `` I'm telling you not to draw that signal -LRB- of direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement -RRB-, but we're in the midst of discussions.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that administration officials had consulted by telephone late Tuesday with congressional leaders and their representatives.

 The prosecutor in the `` preppie murder'' trial suggested in closing statements Wednesday that the defendant strangled a teen-age woman after a bitter Central Park argument about his alcohol-induced impotence. `` Perhaps he could n't perform because he had too many tequilas and beers,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> said of 21-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>. `` Whatever the exact words were, only two human beings know what triggered the fight. It was an argument that escalated and became physical,'' she said. Earlier, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' attorney ridiculed the prosecution version of the death of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and said his client accidentally killed her during rough sex in the park. `` What he was doing was reacting to the pain. He was trying to stop her,'' lawyer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Litman </PERSON> said during his four-hour summation. `` He used force to repel the pain that was being caused to him.'' Chambers is charged with second-degree murder. A former drug abuser who is under indictment on burglary charges in another case, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> admits he killed the victim but says it was an accident after she attacked him sexually and hurt him. <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> repeated her charge that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> brutally beat and murdered Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, 18, while in a rage in the early morning of Aug. 26, 1986. `` He squeezed her neck until her young life expired in his deadly hands. ... She struggled against death. She was in intense pain,'' <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> said. `` She writhed and squirmed to free herself.'' Holding a photo of Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> taken in a bar hours before her death, <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> told the jury: `` One ca n't help but look at that photograph and pray for time to stand still, for time to grab her and say, ` Do n't go with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>, in his summation, repeatedly told the jury in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> that the evidence supported Chambers' version of the woman's death <PERSON> Litman </PERSON> reminded jurors that Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> had pursued Chambers in a bar on the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> the night of her death because she wanted to have sex with him. A friend of Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> testified the slain teen had said her previous encounters with <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> had been `` the best sex'' she ever had. `` That's why she pursued him, and that's why _ unfortunately _ this wound up the way it has,'' <PERSON> Litman </PERSON> said. To convict Chambers in the highly publicized case, `` You must exclude to a moral certainty every inference except one of guilt _ and you ca n't do that,'' he said. `` There are 20 different explanations that are as consistent with reality as the one they're -LRB- the prosecution -RRB- going to try to give you,'' said <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>. Following the summations, the jury is to receive its instructions in the case Thursday before beginning deliberations.

 The very authority by which independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> brought indictments Wednesday against four major participants in the Iran-Contra affair is being challenged in a constitutional battle before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. But a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision striking down the so-called special prosecutor law would not necessarily invalidate the indictments returned against former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> a back-up appointment in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to shield the Iran-Contra inquiry from legal attacks that the special prosecutor law improperly takes power from the president and confers it upon the federal judges. However, the status of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation is further blurred because he began his work before the back-up authority was conferred. The targets of the investigation are expected to argue that the initial absence of the supporting authorization taints the entire inquiry. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments April 26 in the constitutional challenge to the special prosecutor law. Eight justices will decide the outcome. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has removed himself from consideration of the case without explanation. A decision is expected by July. A panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled, 2-1, in January that the independent counsel provision of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is unconstitutional. The law authorizes a federal court to appoint a special prosecutor when the attorney general recommends an independent investigation of a high-ranking administration official accused of a crime. The appeals court ruling came in the investigation of former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> on charges he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, the independent counsel investigating the <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> case, appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> did not receive back-up authority from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and her investigation would be ended if the high court declares the special prosecutor law unconstitutional. Two other inquiries by independent counsels also could be affected by the court's ruling. The perjury conviction of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> could stand or fall on the outcome. The investigation that led to the illegal lobbying conviction of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> had back-up authority similar to that conferred in the Iran-Contra case.

 Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Production at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percent in February, following a 0.3 percent January gain. It was the fifth consecutive increase and left <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry producing at a level 5.8 percent higher than a year ago, although the gains are below advances registered in late 1987. The February increase included a 0.2 percent rise in manufacturing, identical to January's gain. In both months, auto assembly lines were shut down as automakers worked to reduce a high backlog of unsold new cars. Auto production fell 0.9 percent in February and now stands 8.5 percent below where it was in October.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOUSING STARTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction increased sharply in February, by 8.9 percent, the biggest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986. It follows declines of 1.9 percent in January and 15.8 percent in December. All regions posted increases except the West, where starts fell 9 percent. Many economists had predicted a housing rebound, since mortgage rates have fallen since the first of the year and are again in the single-digit range.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Job prospects for production and service workers are the brightest they have been in three years but are declining slightly for technical, professional and office workers, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, a private publisher of business research. Twenty-one percent of the 398 corporations and organizations surveyed said they anticipate expanding production and service work forces from April through June. A year ago 15 percent expected an increase in hiring. But only 19 percent of the companies surveyed said they plan to increase technical and professional staffs, down from 21 percent for 1987's first quarter.

 The results of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary were just what the delegate counters for Democratic candidates <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> expected, including <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s third-place finish without a single delegate. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> predicted early Tuesday that the favorite son senator would claim 135 delegates in the direct-election primary. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> captured 136 of the 173 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobble </PERSON>, delegate counter for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign, expected his candidate to finish with close to 40 delegates based on his forecasts for various counties in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gained 37 delegates. The last-minute advertising blitz launched by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to translate into delegates for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> never made any headway,'' said Cobble. `` He had four days of banging his head.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who contends that after all the primaries and caucuses the Democrats will be `` gridlocked,'' said the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> results solidify his theory of no clear winner heading into the convention. `` Not only does it further assure the likelihood that no one claims a first-ballot victory on the morning of June 8, it pokes big holes in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attempt to claim inevitability,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said. The last big primaries _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ are held June 7. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> still maintains a slight edge in total national convention delegates, according to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has 464.5 delegates with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> second at 460.55 and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> third with 354.8. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> stands in fourth place with 171.5 delegates and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is fourth with 145. There are 272.65 uncommitted delegates. On the Republican side, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ to no one's surprise _ picked up 69 delegates out of the 82 at stake in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Kansas Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> finished a distant second and gained 13 delegates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a commanding lead in the AP delegate count with 774 of the 1,139 needed to nominate. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is second with 178 delegates and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is third with 17. There are 72 uncommitted delegates in the Republican race. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, delegate counter for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, said the total was slightly higher than the delegates the vice president expected, and the campaign immediately started looking to the future. `` In <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, we have a terrific organization. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, that's yet another home state of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has a good organization,'' <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Senate Defeats Move To Make Nuclear Contractors Share Accident
Liability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday rejected an attempt to make private contractors at least partially liable for any future accidents caused by negligent work at the nation's nuclear weapons plants. The chamber voted 53-41 against a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said that subjecting private contractors to potentially huge damage claims while they are performing `` the most important and sensitive function of this government'' would merely drive them away from the nuclear weapons business. `` Rather than attracting the big companies with the reliability and the expertise, we'd wind up with fly-by-night operators running these plants,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s vote came on <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s motion to table the <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> proposal. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, citing a long list of problems in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear complex, argued that `` Unless we hold the contractors responsible, there is absolutely no incentive for them to operate these facilities as safely as possible.'' Most of the DOE's nuclear facilities, which produce the components for nuclear warheads, are operated by private companies, whose contracts total an estimated $ 100 billion. The debate over contractor liability occurred as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> neared passage of a bill to renew the Price-Anderson Act, the government's 30-year-old system of no-fault insurance covering nuclear accidents. The key feature of the measure is a tenfold increase, from $ 700 million to $ 7 billion, in the maximum amount of money that would be available for quick disbursement to victims of any single accident involving nuclear reactors. In the case of nuclear utilities, each commercial reactor would be required to continue to carry the maximum amount of private insurance available _ about $ 160 million. If any given accident cost more than that to compensate victims, the additional money _ up to $ 7 billion _ would be assessed equally among all 110 nuclear plants now operating. Once that pool was exhausted, it would be up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide additional money to victims from taxpayer funds. The government, meanwhile, would continue to self-insure its own nuclear plants, offering the same $ 7 billion maximum that could be disbursed quickly in the wake of an accident. The system, for both commercial and government operations, shortcuts the usual legal requirements for damage claims by eliminating the necessity for victims to bring individual suits in court. Since the legislation was first passed in 1957, DOE contractors have been virtually absolved of any responsibility to share the financial burden in the event of an accident at a government plant. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did approve, 94-0, an amendment offered jointly by <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> which provides for stiff fines, ranging to $ 100,000 per day, for violations of safety rules by <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> contractors. Additional fines, and prison sentences ranging up to five years, could be imposed on corporate officials who commit `` knowing and willful'' safety violations. But <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> fell short on his bid to have contractors share the financial burden caused by accidents, even though, in a last-minute bid for additional support, he watered down the amendment to stipulate that a company could be held financially liable for no more money than its profit on its contract at the plant where an accident occurs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> noted that several companies have threatened to withdraw from bidding on future contracts unless they continued to be exempt from liability. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> already has shut down one weapons production reactor, the Hanford facility in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The others, at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, are being run at partial levels because of safety and environmental problems. <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> announced last year it will not seek to renew its contract to run <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> is considered a front-runner to take over that plant.

 An Arab-American who advocates non-violent resistance to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was arrested Wednesday and may be expelled, officials said. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, was charged with participating in an anti-Israeli demonstration. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said he was questioned for four hours about taking part in a women's sit-in in <LOCATION> Isawiya </LOCATION>, an Arab village incorporated into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the area in 1967. He said he was released by city police on $ 2,000 bail and ordered to appear before a judge, but no date was set for the hearing. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a Palestinian born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen with homes in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He was in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a three-month tourist visa that expired in November. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said he told police investigators the protest began peacefully. `` The women were demonstrating with olive branches to protest the ransacking of five houses by police. I went there, I saw the broken furniture and smashed windows,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after his release. He said he left the village when police ordered him out, then watched from a hillside as police fired tear gas to break up the sit-in. He said Arab youths responded by throwing rocks. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said he was stopped a short time later by traffic police for failing to signal a right turn. He said they ordered him detained when he was unable to present either his Israeli identity card or his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport, which were seized last November when <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> defied an expulsion order. During the questioning, `` the police mentioned expulsion. They said it could be this time for you,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> added. A senior government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the charges could lead to <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s deportation. `` He must be investigated. The charges against him will be checked, according to that we will decide,'' said the official. `` I'm not saying he is definitely going to be expelled, but this -LRB- investigation -RRB- may affect it. Everything depends on what the investigation shows.'' On Monday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to show within 60 days why <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> had not been expelled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly urged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials to allow <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> to remain. `` We've been in touch with him and a consular officer visited him at the police station,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are following the case closely.'' Awad came under fire after the publication in Hebrew of his book titled `` Non-Violent Resistance: A Strategy For the Occupied Territories.'' The book urged the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to refuse to pay taxes, lay down in front of bulldozers to prevent land confiscation and boycott Israeli products. Although <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> has played only a minor role in the current uprising, some of his passive resistance ideas have been adopted, such as boycotting jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and refusing to pay taxes.

 Gunmen on bicycles ambushed and killed auto speed king <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and his wife in their driveway Wednesday, days after he told a friend he had received several death threats and feared for his life. The 59-year-old racing promoter and his wife, <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>, 41, were found dead at dawn, said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatlin </PERSON>. Two male assailants fled on bicycles, investigators said. `` It was a double homicide, an assassination,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinsmoor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> became famous as the `` Speed King'' in the 1950s when he set the first of his nearly 500 auto speed and endurance records. Longtime friend <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> described him as `` one of the greatest hot-rodders we've ever had'' and `` the dominant figure in off-road racing.'' As recently as Sunday, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> expressed fears for his life after receiving numerous death threats, friends and associates said. `` He was a little concerned,'' family friend <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> said. He said he talked to <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> early Sunday and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> mentioned the death threats. `` I do n't know why <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> had to be involved,'' <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> said. `` Everybody loved her.'' Neighbors heard six or eight shots and deputies found the bodies about 6 a.m. in the driveway of the couple's gated, Spanish-style estate in an area of $ 1 million-plus homes 20 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, investigators said. `` We do n't know a motive,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, who would n't divulge the type of weapon used Several bullets struck each of the Thompsons in the upper torso, he said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Difilippo </PERSON>, a building contractor who lives across the street, said he was awakened by shots. `` I heard yelling, ` Do n't shoot.' That was <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Difilippo </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had voiced concern for his life after winning a series of multimillion-dollar lawsuits against another racing promoter. Promoter and one-time partner <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> lost a series of lawsuits to <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stadium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorsports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assets were ordered liquidated last year by a judge to settle the matter. At one point, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> hired a guard, <PERSON> Difilippo </PERSON> said. `` He told me around Christmas they had threatened to kill him,'' <PERSON> Difilippo </PERSON> said. The Thompsons apparently were ambushed as they were getting into their van, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. The van, its passenger window shattered, rolled down the sloping driveway into a block wall. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Thompsons </PERSON> were apparently leaving the house for work when the shooting occurred. He did n't know of any threats against <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> in 1960 became the first to travel over 400 mph on land when he drove a four-engine streamlined car 406.6 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. He later turned to drag racing and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> car racing, and was a top competitor in road racing and off-road championships in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s other sports activities included stunt flying and management of prizefighters. Racing put him in the hospital 27 times, including a seven-month stay when he was paralyzed from the waist down after a boat racing accident. It was two years before he walked again.

 Here is what the presidential Tower commission and the joint congressional investigating committees said about the four men indicted Wednesday in the Iran-Contra arms scandal: former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. The Tower commission, in its Feb. 26, 1987, report to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, depicted <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a backstage manipulator who carried out both the arms sale to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in an `` unprofessional'' manner that invited kickbacks and scandal. The Tower commission said <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, a vice admiral who first was the deputy national security adviser and later held the top post in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, `` failed grievously'' to consider the gravity of the diversion of proceeds from the arms sale to the Contras. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` apparently failed to appreciate or ignored the serious legal and political risks presented,'' the Tower panel said. `` His clear obligation was either to investigate the matter or take it to the president _ or both. He did neither.'' It said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` conducted the operation through Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his associates, a network of private individuals already involved in the Contra resupply operation.'' `` North cut himself off from resources and expertise within the government'' and relied on private businessmen and brokers with `` questionable credentials and potentially large personal financial interests in the transactions. This made the transactions unnecessarily complicated and invited kickbacks and payoffs.'' `` The use of Mr. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s private network in the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative linked those operators with the resupply of the Contras, threatening exposure of both operations if either became public. The result was a very unprofessional operation,'' the Tower report said. The Tower panel said that on one or more occasions, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> may have misled Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about the initiative. The report quoted <PERSON> North </PERSON> as once saying, `` it's going to be just fine ... as soon as everyone knows that ... the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> is helping us with the Contras.'' The report said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` misrepresented his access to the president and attributed to the president things the president never said'' during October 1986 meetings in <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with Iranian representatives. North reportedly told the Iranians that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said he wanted an end to the Iran-Iraq war on terms acceptable to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and that the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states had to be convinced <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Husain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was `` causing the problem.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the Tower commission those statements were `` absolute fiction.'' The report said <PERSON> North </PERSON> once threatened the president of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> with a cutoff of $ 80 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid if he publicized the existence of a secret Costa Rican airfield used to resupply the rebels. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> as a major general in 1983 and became a private arms dealer, controlled Swiss bank accounts under the name of <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> into which $ 20 million in profits from the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were placed, the Tower report said. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> is an Iranian immigrant and naturalized American who was <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s business partner in <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, company. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> helped open the channel of communications to the regime of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The House-Senate Iran-Contra committees in their report last Nov. 18 faulted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for allowing a `` cabal of zealots'' to seize control of foreign policy and skirt the law. The report said that even when <PERSON> North </PERSON> became skeptical that the arms sales would free <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or lead to a new relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` he believed that the prospect of generating funds for the Contras was ` an attractive incentive' for continuing the arms sales.'' `` The decision to designate private parties _ <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> _ to carry out the arms transactions had other ramifications,'' the committees reported. `` First, there was virtually no accounting for the profits from the arms deals. Even <PERSON> North </PERSON> claimed that he did not know how <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> actually spent the money committed to their custody. ... `` Second, by permitting private parties to conduct the arms sales, the administration risked losing control of an important foreign policy initiative.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> came under increasing pressure on Wednesday to give up his faltering presidential campaign as <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said it was time to `` start thinking about November.'' A dozen of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supporters openly debated the merits of his continuing a candidacy that seemed doomed to failure _ although none of them advised <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to get out of the race. In any event, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` They're not going to decide. I decide what I'm going to do here.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, said: `` We're in business.'' Asked for how long, he said, `` Until <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> wants to change it.'' With Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> marching with seeming inevitability toward the nomination, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s aides said the senator had decided to stay in the race until the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on April 5. They said no decision has been made for beyond that date. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides gave the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator wide berth. `` We're prepared to accept whatever decision <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> makes,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, the vice president's deputy campaign manager He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ready to match <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dollar for dollar in any primary state where he chooses to compete, and another spokesman said the vice president has a $ 4.5 million campaign treasury at his disposal. The other aide, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, said he believes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have enough delegates to claim the nomination by the end of April or early May in any event. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>'s comments seemed a broad hint to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that the time is approaching to abandon the race. He stressed his campaign neutrality, but added that he has a responsibility as chairman `` to ask them -LRB- the candidates chasing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- for some self-reflection.'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> should `` start thinking past the convention and start thinking about November'' and the general election. He said either of the two would have to win roughly 75 percent of the remaining delegates at stake to have a chance at the nomination, and he called on them to assess `` realistically'' why they are still in the race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won 774 delegates in The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count, compared with 178 for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and 17 for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. It takes 1,139 to win the Republican nomination at the party convention this summer. None of the three active candidates was campaigning during the day. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended to vice presidential duties and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was at home in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. But there was an extraordinary public airing of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s prospects by his supporters in the wake of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary landslide on Tuesday. Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, said, `` I guess the general feeling among some of us is he should go on through <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.'' She added, `` If there's a way to stay in all the way and speak to the issues ... it benefits the party and benefits him, and it keeps the campaign on a positive level,'' she said. `` But I'm not sure it can be done that way. Maybe it's not worth the strain of continuing on.'' Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, `` If he wants to stay in for a few more weeks he can do it. He's staying in because he's invested three years of his life.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that it looked `` pretty clear and convincing'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be the nominee, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s chances are `` very very difficult, if not impossible. But that's all right. It's not over till it's over.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>, R-Va., said the meeting was of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s `` best friends interested in his best interest and that of the party,'' adding: `` This is a decision for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to make, and we will support that decision. Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said `` no conclusions were drawn'' in the meeting, but `` I think there was a general consensus, more than a general consensus, that now the campaign ought to go forward.'' `` I believe that he should stay in,'' <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said, adding that at the meeting, there was `` absolutely not'' anyone urging <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to get out. <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said Wednesday's Iran-Contra indictments were not discussed in the meeting, but said: `` There's going to be some <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> baggage that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to contend with.'' That view was echoed by Sen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., who was not at the meeting but advised <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to stay in the race `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> ca n't duck the -LRB- Iran-Contra -RRB- issue,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said his colleagues were ` ` very friendly, very positive, very upbeat, saying, ` hang in there.' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides were careful not to gloat, but said it was as good as over. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s `` got to do what's best for him.'' But he added that <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, which holds the next <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary on March 29, `` is going to be a very strong state for us, there's no question about it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoys the support of several Republican elected officials in the state. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, nominally neutral in the presidential race, is writing a newspaper article praising the vice president and is considering a formal endorsement at a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign function being planned for a few days before the primary, sources said. Beyond that, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in a strong position in primaries in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He said he believes the vice president will clinch the delegates needed for the nomination either on April 26 when <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> votes or a week later, with primaries in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who met with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> on Tuesday, says he wo n't compete in either Connecitcut or <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but will concentrate his efforts in caucus states. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says he is now concentrating on expanding his political base for the 1992 campaign. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> indicated in the meeting that he intends to remain a candidate until the nominating convention.

<HEAD>Dukakis Health Care Bill Shaped By Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' highly touted universal health care plan has been streamlined since it was raised a year ago, its deadlines extended, its bureaucracy reduced and its funding expanded by millions of dollars. But the proposal's basic premise, making <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> the first state to guarantee health insurance protection for all its residents, remains intact. The plan, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has held up as an example to the nation in his Democratic presidential campaign, awaits final action by a legislative conference committee. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the chief architect of the bill, said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposals are so similar that `` there are no major sticking points'' that would prevent passage. Universal health care in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> first came to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in a position paper issued by <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> in February 1987. `` In my wildest dreams, I did n't think a year later we'd be almost on the verge of accomplishing it,'' she said. `` I thought it would take much, much longer.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't an initial supporter of universal health care, considering it too costly. In his original proposal in August, the governor did not suggest any state spending for the plan, maintaining that employers should shoulder the cost. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> is credited with getting the governor to support the present plan, which would phase in health care until all residents are insured by 1992. The present plan retains <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposed unemployment surcharge tax on employers who do n't provide coverage by 1992. But it also contains a state commitment of $ 500 million or more over the next four years to make sure everyone is covered. The governor has taken the issue on the campaign trail, talking as much about the 600,000 uninsured in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as the 40 million uninsured nationally. Only <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has anything comparable to what's been proposed in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The state has required employers to provide workers with insurance coverage since the early 1970s. The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act was passed after <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s law took effect to prevent other states from imposing similar mandates on employers, and questions remain about how <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' proposal will fare under federal review. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' small businesses lobbied hard and successfully against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' bill last year. This year, although some small business groups still oppose it, the measure has been reshaped to reflect their concerns. State-brokered pooled insurance for small employers was added. So were tax breaks and a `` hardship trust fund'' in which the state agrees to help employers pay insurance costs that exceed 5 percent of their revenues. The House also passed an amendment exempting employers of nine or fewer workers from the 1992 deadline for providing employee coverage. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version has no such exemption, and the issue is expected to be a focal point of the conferee negotiations. Other major changes since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> first proposed the bill include allowing more time to put the system into effect and scrapping a plan to create a `` super agency'' to oversee the universal health care system.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> blasted each other's capitals with missiles, hammered other cities with air raids, and fought ground battles along the front Wednesday The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> called for an end to the carnage. Hundreds were reported killed in the air and ground exchanges, the latest in more than two weeks of almost daily attacks on the two nations' heaviest population centers. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards fired five missiles into the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghad </LOCATION> after 70 Iranian civilians were killed in Iraqi missile attacks on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and warplane raids on seven Iranian cities The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> confirmed only three hits on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and said `` many civilians were killed or wounded.'' The agency, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, did not give a casualty count but reported seven missiles fired at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> confirmed that missiles hit the capital and said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION> and other cities in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iranian agency said 25 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded in Shiraz alone. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it has fired 22 surface-to-surface missiles into the Iranian capital since a two-day truce in the so-called `` war of the cities'' broke down late Sunday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has reported launching seven into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The Iranian agency also said Revolutionary Guards pushed into <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> province in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and seized 95 square miles, including 21 villages, in heavy battles with Iraqi troops. It said more than 3,100 Iraqis were killed or wounded and 800 taken prisoner in the fighting in the mountainous region, 160 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The agency said Iranian troops were in control of the town of <LOCATION> Khurmal </LOCATION>, near the border, and that the residents in the `` liberated'' area `` warmly welcomed the attacking Iranian combatants.'' In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zuercher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> quoted Iranian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> as saying his country had cut all ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> also was quoted as saying only a military solution could end the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> no longer felt obligated to respect international conventions which are supposed to protect civilians and prisoners in wartime and ban the use of chemical weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, demanded an end to the missile attacks on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. It also endorsed another round of negotiations by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on implementing the council's July 20 cease-fire resolution and peace plan for the 7 -LCB- - year-old war A statement issued by the council president said the 15 nations on the panel `` strongly deplore the escalation of hostilities between these two countries, particularly the attacks against civilian targets and cities ...'' A presidential statement is the mildest form of council action. It falls short of the resolution and the appointment of a special negotiator the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had been seeking. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said the Soviet idea would divert attention from the July resolution. The resolution demands an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal to international boundaries as the first steps for negotiating an end to the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s news agency said jet fighters bombed the northern Iraqi city of <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> and other cities, `` inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy.'' The Iraqi agency reported that warplanes Tuesday raided a `` large maritime target,'' a reference to an oil tanker, that night. Gulf-based marine executives had reported a raid on the Liberian-flagged Trade Fortitude at around the same time.

 Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, his face drawn and gray, his voice breaking, said Wednesday he was caught in the cross-fire of a bitter dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president and that `` it is a shame the new battleground for such a fight will be in a courtroom.'' The Marine officer talked to reporters a few hours after a federal grand jury indicted him and three others on conspiracy charges. `` I did not commit any crime. I intend to fight allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. He said the fight will entail enormous costs, personal and financial, but `` nevertheless, I can assure you, I will never give up, we will win.'' North's eyes clouded and his voice quavered as he thanked the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` who have shown so much love and concern these past 16 months by their millions of telegrams and letters and prayers and support.'' Beside him was his lawyer, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who also represented North at last summer's hearings before joint committees of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, whose spirited defense of his client was one of the highlights of the hearings, said that seeking Wednesday's indictment `` was one of the worst prosecutorial decisions in the history of our country. `` It is a decision of an unaccountable prosecutor who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> determined to allege that some crime, any crime had been committed,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the independent counsel `` presents an indictment after 15 months -LRB- of investigation -RRB- based on mistaken facts, novel and sometimes ridiculous legal theories. `` The return of an indictment under these circumstances presented here is an abuse of the criminal process,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` Everyone must seriously wonder about a decision to indict a man like <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a highly decorated <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officer, based on his tireless effort in the interests of his country.'' For his part, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said it was a sad irony that the decision to indict should occur on the fourth anniversary of the abduction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and the third anniversary of the kidnapping of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' Middle East correspondent. `` The indictment is also sad for our country,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. He said that as a Marine officer he had always done his best. `` Unfortunately, I have now been caught in a bitter dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president over the control of foreign policy, the power of the president to deter communism in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the president's duty to protect our citizens against terrorist acts abroad,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` It is a shame that the new battleground for such a fight will be a courtroom,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. After he read his statement, <PERSON> North </PERSON> turned to leave. A reporter asked `` who authorized you to conduct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy?'' `` I'm not going to take any questions,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>.

 Separated Siamese twin <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> may have suffered new brain damage after choking during a routine feeding, <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> had been left unattended briefly late Sunday afternoon when he choked on formula fed to him through a nasal tube, according to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Hopkins Children's Center Since then, he has had some seizures, she said. A nurse making a routine check on the room <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> shares with his brother <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, found he had stopped breathing, called for emergency help and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> was rushed to the pediatric intensive care unit, where a ventilator was attached to mechanically aid his breathing. The child awakened an hour later, an indication that his breathing had not stopped for very long, Ms. <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> said. Doctors believe `` there may be some damage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> said, because `` he has had, since the incident, some mild seizures.'' She described them as `` jerking movements of the face'' and said they had been stopped by medication. The twins had been doing well since surgery last month to implant titanium mesh plates in the opening at the back of their heads, created by a complex, marathon operation last September to separate their joined skulls. Doctors said both boys sustained slight brain damage during the separation procedure, and the long-term effects remain uncertain. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> remained in good condition Tuesday, while <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> was listed in stable condition and showing slight improvement in the intensive care unit. Doctors had hoped the 13-month-old twins would be going home to Ulm, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, by the end of March, but Ms. <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s setback could cause a delay.

 Investigators Wednesday were trying to determine when and where the USS <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>'s disbursement officer was strangled, shot and robbed of the ship's payroll, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman The body of Lt. <PERSON> Ratish </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>, 24, was found Tuesday inside a locker on the destroyer. About $ 94,000 was missing from his office safe, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said, revising the amount downward from Tuesday's estimate of $ 120,000 `` He was shot at close range, and also strangled,'' said Chief Petty Officer Art <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON>. There was no indication <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> also was bludgeoned, as first reports indicated, <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said. `` With all the blood and everything, that's the way it looked,'' <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said. `` The bullet apparently passed right through the head.'' Final autopsy reports have not been released, <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said. The time of death and where <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> was shot had not been determined, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. No bullets or casings were found, and the caliber of the weapon was not known, <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said the twice-monthly payroll, due for disbursement Tuesday, was $ 70,000, and about $ 20,000 in cash usually is kept in the safe. No information was available on suspects from <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officers working with <PERSON> Duval-Jacksonville </PERSON> sheriff's deputies, <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said People trying to board the destroyer or other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships must pass checkpoints at the base entrance, the pier area and the ship itself, <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said. Only family members and friends of the crew who have been previously cleared are allowed aboard the ship in port, he said. Even Naval personnel who do not have business on the ships can not board, he said. <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>, who was single and came from <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, had enlisted three years ago. Lt.

 The White House remained silent Wednesday on the question of whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would pardon key figures indicted by a federal grand jury for their involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. Under the Constitution, a president holds immense power when it comes to granting pardons. The question now looms whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will choose to use it. On Wednesday, a federal grand jury indicted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former national security adviser, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, along with fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and two arms dealers on conspiracy charges in the diversion of Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contras. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was informed of the indictments by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, his deputy chief of staff. Speaking of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` He had no response.'' He said there was no White House comment because `` it's a matter before the courts.'' Since the Iran-Contra scandal erupted in November 1986, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has refused _ in public at least _ to entertain any discussion of pardons. `` This is a subject I have not and will not discuss at this time,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said last November. Reporters tried _ at least four times that day _ to persuade him to discuss it, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeatedly refused to do so. In the intervening months, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been careful not to rule out the option. He has made it clear _ particularly in his description of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> as an `` American hero'' _ that he is giving the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide the benefit of the doubt. `` I'm going to wait until he's had his day in court,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said last summer when queried about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony before the joint congressional committees investigating the matter. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added that he was `` not going to pre-judge'' North based on his televised appearances before the committees. And after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completed its investigation, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a national broadcast that he thought <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` believed they were doing what I would've wanted done.'' Although contending he was as `` mad as a hornet'' about the damage inflicted on his administration, the president has never criticized his aides for lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, shredding documents or participating in a cover-up. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, questioned at one time about the series of laws in 1985 and 1986 barring direct or indirect military aid to the Contras, responded: `` I do n't think that the law was broken.'' In fact, if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> choses to grant pardons to anyone connected with the affair, he would not have to list a specific crime that is being pardoned. Such sweeping power amounts to a legal grant of absolution, enshrined in the Constitution. The Founding Fathers borrowed the concept from English common law. It allows a president virtually unlimited authority covering `` offenses against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, except in cases of impeachment.'' `` He's really very free,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienes </PERSON>, a professor of constutional law at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. A president is able to grant a pardon involving a federal crime solely on his own initiative _ he need not consult anyone or even wait for an indictment or conviction before taking action, <PERSON> Dienes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dienes </PERSON> cited an 1867 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case, <ORGANIZATION> Ex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garland </ORGANIZATION>, which states the effect of such a presidential decision: `` In the eye of the law, the offender is as innocent as if he never committed the offense.'' During his nearly eight years in office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has granted 333 pardons out of 1,894 requests, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Normally, the process begins with a four-page application submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pardon attorney. Since virtually all the applicants have been convicted of crimes, the department's guidelines require that applicants wait five years to seven years after the completion of their sentences. But presidents are allowed under the Constitution to avoid that route. Two months into his first term, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ignored the formal procedure and granted pardons to two former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials convicted of sanctioning warrantless break-ins. That was the path President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> took to pardon <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on Sept. 8, 1974, for any wrongdoing connected with the Watergate scandal. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-emptive pardon sent his popularity ratings into a tumble. It also contributed to his loss of the 1976 elections. Although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is barred from running again, his decision in this case could affect Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chances in the presidential election this fall and those of other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates, according to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a senior fellow and specialist in presidential affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> predicted that if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided to pardon any Iran-Contra figures, he would wait until after the November elections. `` Since <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s action cost him the election, I doubt we'll see <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> move before November,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. He added: `` I would be stunned if there is n't a pardon between election day and January 1989. As outgoing president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is in the best position to take the heat.''

 Protests that began months ago with allegations of criminal conduct by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have turned into public rage over unpaid salaries in an economy without money. The largest demonstrations in nine months of turmoil, accompanied by strikes, took place Wednesday. They started at about 10 a.m. and riot squads managed to disperse the crowds by mid-afternoon. By early evening the streets were deserted except for police patrols. People were reported injured, but there were no confirmed figures. There were reports of widespread looting and several stores were set ablaze. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who rules <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as chief of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> _ the military and police _ has been indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on narcotics charges and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday he wants the general `` out of there.'' Economic pressure applied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> includes a freeze on Panamanian government accounts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and withholding <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> revenues. This has dried up the supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s national currncy. Wednesday's protests began soon after young officers led by Police Chief <PERSON> Leonidas </PERSON> <PERSON> Macias </PERSON> mounted an unsuccessful coup. Shops and other businesses closed early. Reporters saw protesters at a barricade stop and open a refrigerated truck and empty it of frozen chickens. Electric power went off throughout the country at about midday, soon after workers of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> walked out to protest not being paid. Government workers were sent home after waiting all morning for biweekly paychecks that did not arrive. Public transportation stopped because employees were not paid. In lower-income neighborhoods, burning barricades appeared at street corners. Many protesters identified themselves as `` civilistas'' _ members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a coaliton of about 200 business, professional, labor, student and opposition groups. The Crusade was formed last June, after the first reports that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in drug dealing, corruption and allegedly even political murder. Its stated purpose was to force him out. Protesters at many street corners Wednesday stoned the few buses that were running and any cars suspected of being from the government. Those carrying journalists were allowed to pass. `` It is time for the gringos to come in,'' a demonstrator shouted at a carload of reporters, using the slang for North Americans. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, a Crusade leader, said: `` The fight will intensify tomorrow.'' One large group of protesters was made up of health workers from Social Security hospitals. They yelled that they have not been paid and many fought riot police with rocks and sticks. Soldiers went to Social Security institutions Wednesday morning and disarmed hospital security guards, also members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. `` They probably do not want the people to take the guards' guns away,'' a hospital employee said. A nurse said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>: `` He must go. Look what he is doing to this country.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former national security adviser, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, and fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> were indicted Wednesday along with two arms dealers on charges they conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contras. The long-awaited 23-count indictment, which also named retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, said the four men `` deceitfully and without legal authorization'' organized, directed and concealed `` a program to continue funding of and logistical and other support for military and paramilitary operations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by the Contras'' at a time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law barred such action. The indictment charged that proceeds from the the $ 30 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were diverted illegally to foreign bank accounts controlled by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> for their personal financial gain. Only $ 12.2 million from the arms sales was turned over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> also were charged with conspiring to pay illegal gratuities to North by arranging the installation of a security system at the Marine officer's home and by creating a $ 200,000 fund for his family in a Swiss bank. Outside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse, <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told reporters the investigation was continuing but declined to say whether there would be any more criminal charges brought in the case. `` The grand jury is not finished,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` This is simply an interim report.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was fired from his job as a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide in late 1986, said: `` I did not commit any crime. I intend to fight the allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary.'' His voice breaking, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said the months ahead will be difficult. But, he added: `` Nonetheless, I can asure you, I will never give up, we will win, I just can not tell you how soon.'' North's attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told repoorters it will be necessary to call high-ranking officials to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the indictment was an abuse of the criminal process and said a criminal court is not the place to solve a dispute between the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is mind-boggling to consider a protracted trial,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. A secretary in <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s office said he was out of town and had not commented on the indictment. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was informed of the indictments by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, his deputy chief of staff. Speaking of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` He had no response.'' He said there was no White House comment because `` it's a matter before the courts.'' Just hours before the indictment, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if he still stood by his assertion that no laws were broken in the Iran-Contra affair. `` I have no knowledge of anything that was broken,'' he replied. Asked why he felt that way, he replied, `` because from all of the investigation and everything else, we do n't know where that money came from and we do n't know who had it and we do n't know where it went. All I know was that we got the purchase price we had asked for.'' But the indictment, among other things, charged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> conspired to divert millions of dollars from the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government arms to the alleged `` Enterprise.'' Among other things the indictment charged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to lower its price from $ 6,000 to $ 3,469 for each of the 1,000 TOW missiles sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in February 1986 even though the Iranians were paying $ 10,000 apiece. As a result, the `` Enterprise'' kept more than $ 6 million and turned over only $ 3.7 million to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, the indictment said. In May 1986, only $ 6.5 million of the $ 15 million that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> paid for spare Hawk missile parts was turned over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, leaving nearly $ 8.5 million for the `` Enterprise,'' the indictment said. The indictment culminated a 14-month grand jury investigation into the arms-for-hostages deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of nearly $ 4 million in profits to the Contras. All four defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud the government and commit criminal offenses against it, theft of government property and wire fraud arising from the diversion of arms-sale proceeds. The these charges together carry maximum penalties of 25 years imprisonment. Each of the three charges carries a potential $ 250,000 fine. North was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, making false statements, obstructing Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s Nov. 21-23, 1986, inquiry by making false statements and concealing, falsifying and destroying classified government documents in <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> files. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s weekend inquiry uncovered the diversion of arms-sale profits and led to <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s resignation and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s dismissal from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff.

 <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was named in two counts of obstructing a congressional inquiry and two other counts of false statements. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was accused of lying to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees on Nov. 21, 1986, by saying he did not learn about the November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> until three months later. The indictment also charges that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, a computer buff, deleted from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> computer system all stored messages that he had sent or received. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> are also charged with lying to House committees in the summer of 1986 by falsely stating that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was not helping raise money for the Contras or providing military advice to the rebels. The obstruction and false statement charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> each carry five-year sentences and a $ 250,000 fine. After a full day of deliberations, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was called to the grand jury room at 3:54 p.m. and told the panel was ready to return an indictment. The 21 members of the grand jury then filed upstairs to a courtroom where the 101-page indictment was formally returned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>. The case was assigned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, 77, who was appointed by President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and presided over one of the Watergate trials. Last week, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s predecessor as national security adviser, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges that he withheld information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and in 1986 by denying that members of his staff, particularly <PERSON> North </PERSON>, were helping raise private money to arm the Contras during the Contra aid ban. The indictment also charged <PERSON> North </PERSON> with obstructing the independent counsel's investigation of the security system at his <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home by creating false documents to conceal the fact that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had paid $ 16,000 for it installation. He was charged with illegally accepting the security system as a gratuity. The indictment also charged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> pocketed $ 4,500 of $ 90,000 in travelers checks that he received from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> to cover expenses related to the rebel cause and the efforts to obtain release <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In a statement, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Janis </PERSON>, said: `` We believe strongly that Mr. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> has committed no crimes and that ths indictment is unfair and unwarranted.'' Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, who chaired the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee, said, he believed `` justice will ultimately be done.'' `` While I personally remain convinced that they exhibited insufficient sensitivity to the rule of law, and to the fact that under our system of government the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> makes the laws, we must await the verdict of a jury of their peers as to whether this insensitivity was criminal in nature,'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, another member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel who was one of the administration's strongest supporters during the congressional hearings, said the investigation was `` a colossal embarrassment to our whole government.'' `` It's going to be a very tricky trial to try to prove these charges in an open forum,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> told reporters. `` I'm not white-washing this. There were serious mistakes made here,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to felony charges that they conspired with <PERSON> North </PERSON> to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise $ 3.2 million for the Contras. The indictment also charged <PERSON> North </PERSON> with participating in that conspiracy.

<HEAD>Security Council Ask South Africa to Spare `Sharpeville Six</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Security Council unanimously urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Wednesday to commute the sentences of the `` <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six,'' sentenced to be executed for a 1984 death by mob violence. Its resolution asked for a stay of the executions, scheduled for Friday, and said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s `` practice'' of executing opponents of apartheid has harmed the search for peace. On Tuesday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issued a personal appeal for the lives of the six. They were convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black township councilman stoned and burned to death in the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> township south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. An appeals court judge ruled that they did not kill him personally but had common purpose with the mob. <PERSON> Dragoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pejic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president for March, said death sentences for the `` African patriots'' had caused `` undivided international condemnation and uproar.'' He also said thousands of innocent black South Africans have been detained and tortured. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> sent a telegram to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> asking mercy be shown the five men and one woman on humanitarian grounds. He said clemency would help reduce tensions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where 5 million whites control the government and the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The council resolution spoke of the `` <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> racist regime's decision to execute the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six ... in defiance of worldwide appeals. Ambassador <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> issued a statement criticizing the council, which frequently condemns his country. He said the government `` strongly objects'' to council action that interferes `` not only in an internal South African matter but also a matter which is the result of the due process of law.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` is not insensitive to the feelings aroused by capital punishment but must respect the independence of the country's judicial system,'' his statement said. `` Murder is a common law crime. It has nothing to do with the color of a person's skin.

 A Japanese sound expert testified Wednesday that tape-recordings show President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband was killed on an airport stairway in 1983 by a gun other than previously claimed, and that soldiers shouted `` Let me do it! <PERSON> Matsumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acoustics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, testified at the trial of 34 soldiers and three civilians accused of murdering former Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Galman </PERSON>, a purported communist agent originally accused as <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s assassin. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s murder led to a groundswell of opposition to then-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> that culminated in a February 1986 popular revolt which deposed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> after 20 years in office and swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> identified four soldiers as the ones who shouted `` This is it!,'' `` Let me do it!'' and `` Shoot, shoot!'' seconds before <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was murdered at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport on Aug. 21, 1983. He said the soldiers shouted in <LOCATION> Tagalog </LOCATION>, the main Filipino language. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was shot as he left a <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight under military escort on his return from three years self-exile in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to lead the opposition to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The soldiers shot <PERSON> Galman </PERSON> on the tarmac seconds after <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> fell. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, speaking in Japanese through an interpreter, said he analyzed sounds picked up by journalists' tape-recorders during the assassination and from test-firing various types of guns in Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> studios. Chief prosecutor <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> later told reporters <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s testimony supports the prosecution's claim that <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was killed on the stairway, where only soldiers were in a position to shoot him in the back of the head The <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> government claimed <PERSON> Galman </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on the tarmac with a .357 - caliber <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said his analysis of tape-recordings show the first shot, which has been established as the one that killed <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, could have come only from a .45 - caliber He said the sound of the footsteps of <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and his four soldier escorts were clearly picked up by two boom microphones extended over the top of the 21-step stairway as the party began descending. `` We can clearly analyze the sound of the first step to the 11th step,'' he said. `` After the 11th step ... the sound of gunfire was heard.'' The tapes picked up the words `` Eto na'' -LRB- This is it -RRB-, followed by `` Ako na. Ako na'' -LRB- Let me do it. Let me do it -RRB- and `` <LOCATION> Pusila </LOCATION>. Pusila.'' -LRB- Shoot. Shoot. -RRB- <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said that from a study of voice prints, he concluded the words `` Eto na'' were shouted by Lt. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, chief of the security detail who remained at the stop of the stairs while <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was led down. The words `` let me do it'' were spoken by Sgts. Claro Lat and <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> one after the other, he said. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said the fatal shot came after both <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and Constable 1st Class <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazaga </PERSON> shouted `` shoot'' one after the other. Defense Lawyer <PERSON> Rodoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> objected that `` voice analysis is not an exact science.'' But <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> claimed that like fingerprints, a voice print is unique and can not be duplicated. Judge <PERSON> Regino </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermosisima </PERSON>, one of the three judges trying the case, said the court was accepting <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s testimony as `` part of the evidence although this is not an exact science.'' An earlier trial acquitted 25 soldiers and one civilian implicated in the Aquino-Galman murders. But soon after Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> became president, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had influenced the decision and ordered a retrial.

<HEAD>Tutu Cancels Meeting With Dutch Reformed Church Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> on Wednesday canceled a meeting with leaders of the white Dutch Reformed Church after they described his challenge of government policy as `` impious.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a prominent foe of apartheid and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, had planned to meet the leaders in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Thursday for the first formal talks between the two churches since 1960. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and most other government officials belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the largest denomination of the dominant Afrikaner white minority. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he canceled the meeting because of an `` abusive attack'' on his church in a statement issued Tuesday by Dutch Reformed leaders and published Wednesday. He said the leaders `` deliberately sabotaged the talks.'' Later Wednesday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> issued a statement asking <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> to repudiate the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> says he does not endorse the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s use of violence but shares its professed goal of a non-racial democracy. `` The question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of the kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SACP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- South African Communist Party -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` Are you in favor of the establishment of a Marxist dictatorship in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> under the rule of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SACP </ORGANIZATION>, to the detriment of the church?'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> later met with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to urge clemency for the `` <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six'' _ a group of blacks scheduled to hang Friday for complicity in a 1984 mob killing during anti-apartheid unrest. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> scolded him for taking a confrontational stance toward the government. The archbishop said his decision to cancel the church meeting was influenced by a `` background of unease'' related to the scheduled hangings. He urged Dutch Reformed leaders to join Anglican clergy in prayers for condemned prisoners. The Dutch Reformed leaders' statement referred to comments by <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a mixed-race minister, at a church service Sunday in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> were protesting a recent government ban on political activity by 19 organizations. <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> used strong language in responding to Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s warnings that he will act against the clergymen if they did not stop `` preaching revolution.'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said the government `` signed its own death warrant. ... No government can challenge the living God and survive.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said, `` If it is revolution to say I work for a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that is truly democratic ... I am for that.'' The Dutch Reformed Church objected to the clergymen's `` language, convictions and veiled threats that do not breathe the spirit of the Gospel. It said it was `` not unsympathetic to the problems that churches in this country have to contend with.'' But the statement called on <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> `` to divorce themselves from this impious road and to discuss their problems openly'' with <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` who are both avowed Christians.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> issued a statement Wednesday through the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> saying the churches had to recognize `` certain limitations in the execution of their prophetic task outside the ecclesiastical field.'' One major point of <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s sermons was to dispute <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s statement that they were preaching revolution instead of the Christian message. The Dutch Reformed statement appeared to agree with <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. `` In exceeding these limits they have confronted the state, and can not equate themselves with the church in the face of state retaliation,'' it said. `` The Church of Jesus Christ can not be used as a means for a revolutionary change of government.'' By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Woman Pleads Guilty To Locking Boy In Box</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who pleaded guilty to keeping an 8-year-old in a playhouse-sized box for two years says she was trying to prevent the boy from destroying her property while she slept. <PERSON> Retha </PERSON> <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON>, 54, pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment Tuesday. Sentencing was set for April 26. The child, who was kept in the box from 1985 to 1987, is the son of Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON>' stepdaughter. When the boy was removed from the Skyles home, he said he was surprised to learn that all little boys were n't kept in boxes, court papers said. In a handwritten statement, Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON> said, `` I restrained -LRB- the boy -RRB- during my sleeping hours in order to keep him from destroying property. `` My judgment may not have been proper, but my judgment as to the amount of restraint seemed proper to me under the circumstances,'' she said. The box often was locked and contained a jar in which the boy was expected to urinate, police said. He was not allowed to attend school, but did attend church. When he was removed from the home, he had a severe case of head lice. The law provides for a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail, two years' probation and a requirement that the woman pay indefinitely for counseling for the boy, deputy prosecutor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Corey-Boulet </PERSON> said Wednesday. However, a judge can declare the case exceptional and impose a stronger sentence. The prosecutor declined to comment on whether she thought the sentence contained in the law would be appropriate, adding only that the boy is `` going to be needing a lot of counseling as he adjusts to a more normal life and she's -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON> -RRB- going to be paying for that. That's the kind of punishment that will benefit the child.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fehr </PERSON>, executive director of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Crime and Delinquency, said: `` One ca n't help but be struck by the discrepancy ... in regard to a child being confined for a much longer period of time than the person who pleaded guilty to the crime.'' Ms. <PERSON> Skyles </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON>, did not return messages left with his office Wednesday. An anonymous tip led <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> workers to the <LOCATION> Skyles </LOCATION> home, where they took the boy and his 11-year-old sister into custody. They are living with foster parents and are `` thriving,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendizabal </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DSHS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

<HEAD>Ferry Workers Vote To Continue Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 2,000 ferry workers voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to continue a six-week strike against a ferry line, despite a company ultimatum to sign new contracts or lose their jobs. In an outdoor meeting in this southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> port, all but two of the ferry workers from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION> raised their hands in favor of maintaining the strike. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, deputy general secretary, and other union leaders urged members to step up picketing and fight what they said were moves by P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> to hire non-union foreign workers. The strike has halted sailings of P and O's 11 vessels between <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> and the French ports of <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION> across the English Channel and <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, chairman of the ferry company, denied the company planned to use foreign workers and said he was disappointed with the vote. `` I hope they will opt for the new contracts,'' he said. The ferry workers struck after the company announced plans to reduce the number of crews for each vessel. Pay for a deckhand ranges from $ 23,125 to $ 33,300 a year. The union agreed to fewer jobs to maintain profitable operations against the challenge of the Channel Tunnel project, but wanted the cuts spread over three years. The underwater rail tunnel now being built between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is scheduled to open in May 1993 at a cost of $ 9 billion and is expected to cut into ferry profits. The company's ultimatum followed the collapse of five days of talks with the union, which were convened by the government's arbitration service Each side accused the other of intransigence. Six hundred ferry masters and officers will decide whether to settle a dispute with the company at a meeting Saturday. The company wants to cut 200 of their jobs because of redundancies and new work patterns. The officers have not been on strike.

 A Republican senator said the investigation that led to indictments Wednesday of four people in the Iran-Contra scandal was a `` colossal embarrassment'' to the government, while Democrats said the charges vindicate last year's congressional inquiry into the arms and money affair. The charges were announced by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the independent counsel whose investigation began about the same time that committees of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began looking at the secret sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of some of the money to the Nicaraguan Contras. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, said he believes that `` justice will ultimately be done.'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> added that `` I personally remain convinced that they -LRB- the four men -RRB- exhibited insufficient sensitivity to the rule of law, and to the fact that under our system of government the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must make the laws,'' but he said, `` we must await the verdict of a jury of their peers as to whether this insensitivity was criminal in nature.'' Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee, noted that the indictments closely paralleled the conclusions of the congressional committees, although the panels made no attempt to assess criminal blame `` I do n't think there are any major surprises,'' he said, although `` there was more of an emphasis on the misuse of federal funds ... than I might have anticipated.'' `` They are very serious charges, obviously, and quite extensive,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> told reporters. `` They cover a lot of misconduct.'' He added that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> probably developed more information than the committees were able to get on financial records. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, another member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, said, `` it is a serious matter when any citizen is charged with a crime, and it is even more serious when a former high government official, and close adviser to the president, is charged.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said `` no one should prejudge the case,'' but said he had heard nothing in the indictments which had not come out during last summer's Iran-Contra hearings. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, another member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, was one of the administration's strongest supporters during the congressional hearings and he was critical of the indictments. The investigation was `` a colossal embarrassment to our whole government,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> told a news conference. `` It's going to be a very tricky trial to try to prove these charges in an open forum.'' `` I'm not white-washing this. There were serious mistakes made here,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` You may very well be able to get convictions under technicalities of the law,'' he said, speaking of the indictments, but `` these indictments are choking on the nits of the law.'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee and another strong administration supporter, said, `` these indictments are n't any surprise But this is only the beginning of what will be a very long legal process that will question the sufficiency of the indictments and the constitutionality of the laws.'' For example, he said, `` I believe the indictments are premised on some assumptions that may or may not be true, like title to the money. The prosecutors believe the money from the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and therefore it was misappropriated for the Contras, but I think a very good argument can be made that the proceeds of the sale do n't belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., a candiate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said, `` whatever the outcome of these prosecutions, I think the special prosecutor has given us fresh evidence that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration generally has put the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through the shredder. `` This will be an important issue in the campaign,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said, particularly the role of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, another presidential candidate, said the indictments were `` a source of embarrassment to this administration and a disgrace to our country,'' but called those indicted `` the fall guys.'' `` They were, in fact, implementing this administration's policy,'' he said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide who was one of the four men charged, was supported Wednesday by <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private, conservative organization. Messing is a friend of North. `` It's a difference between persecution and prosecution that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is going to have to explain to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> said. `` After 15 months and $ 10 million and almost 300 people at his disposal, Judge <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is going to have to convince the American people that is not persecution but a prosecution.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, president of another group that supports <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement calling on the president to pardon North. `` Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> is a man of principle, honor and commitment. His patriotic, pro-American values are a tremendous asset to the well-being of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` This is hardly the definition of a criminal,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` He should be pardoned immediately.''

<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A soldier in one of the units involved in a helicopter collision that killed 17 servicemen said at a memorial service Wednesday that the loss was magnified by `` the bond between us soldiers.'' Military and civilian dignitaries, including Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, joined family members and other mourners in the 450-seat Post Central Chapel for two services. The first half-hour memorial honored the seven Army aviators flying the helicopters when they collided March 8; the second paid homage to the 10 foot soldiers on board. An open Bible rested on a simple altar, flanked by banners representing the the 101st Airborne Division and flags pinned with colorful streamers representing battles in which units of the 101st fought. The seven helicopter crewmen were represented in front of the altar by seven flight helmets placed atop sabers for the officers and M-16 rifles for the enlisted men. Infantry helmets were used to represent the foot soldiers. The 17 were killed when a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, returning from a night mission, was struck by another copter on a separate mission at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>. Army investigators said they have not determined the cause of the crash. `` During the toughest of times we find ourselves wondering why we choose to be infantrymen,'' said Spec. 4 <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, whose unit included 10 of the victims. `` It is a job that is at best difficult and at its worst fatal.'' The loss was magnified by `` the bond between us as soldiers, which brought us closer to each other in a way that so many others can never know; something that only people who serve in a profession such as ours can ever understand,'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. `` I have flown personally with each of these -LRB- helicopter crew members -RRB-. I can tell you without reservation that they truly loved what they were doing,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fucci </PERSON>, commander of the 101st Aviation Regiment's 5th Brigade. `` We all share in the loss of these men. And though all the grief that we feel does not begin to compare with the sorrow being felt by their wives and their families, our hearts and our prayers go out to you,'' he said.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed Wednesday that the superpowers freeze their naval forces in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> as a first step toward reducing tensions in the region. He described the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> as `` one of the most explosive regions in the world'' and recommended that the freeze begin July 1. In a wide-ranging speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also indirectly criticized the late Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who imposed an economic blockade of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> after President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> set his own foreign policy course in 1948. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader also discussed the ethnic unrest in his own country, saying he was determined to resolve it democratically but would not allow independence for nationalist groups. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> itself is an ethnically diverse nation of six republics and two autonomous regions and is plagued by growing ethnic tensions as the economic situation worsens. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later flew to <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, capital of the northern <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> republic, one of the most prosperous regions in the communist world. Plans for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief to visit a private farm in the area were canceled because he arrived late, officials said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet Slovenian leaders Thursday as he continues his five-day visit here. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said his country was concerned about the military presence in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> because it is provides Soviet ports on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> their only access to the world's oceans. In addition to the naval freeze, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called on the superpowers to set a limit on the number of vessels they maintain in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, and he suggested they give each other and nations in the region advance notice when they redistribute their forces or conduct military exercises there. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also proposed that military observers be permitted to watch such maneuvers. He made no direct reference to ethnic rioting in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, in which at least 32 people were killed, nor did he mention mass demonstrations in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. But he said the state of relations between the more than 100 nationalities within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is `` one of the most important and delicate issues in a multinational country such as ours.'' `` There are certain difficulties inherited from the past,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, apparently referring to a 1923 decision to put an Aremenian-controlled region under control of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians' demands for annexation of that region are believed to have been at the root of the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> riots. `` We are determined to secure democratic solutions to these problems,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, but he served notice that he would not tolerate nationalists' demands for independence. That theme has been kept alive by exile groups from the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithusania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. `` Whatever constituent or autonomous republic or region we take, it is now bound by thousands of threads to all other parts of the country,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It has indisoluble links within the integrated economic and political complex.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the 1948 rupture in relations between his country and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> `` inflicted grave damage on Yugoslav-Soviet relations and ... on socialism as a whole.'' But he assured his hosts he wants improved relations with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and does not intend to try to press his ideas of perestroika, or restructuring, on them. `` We are implementing our perestroika in keeping with the conditions and needs of our own country, and we have no intention whatsoever to palm it off as a universal model or recipe that would be good for all,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The Soviet leader blasted unnamed leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance for `` harping on the lie'' of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat to prevent nuclear disarmament and build up <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` These contradictions, not to say absurdities, have quite definite political convictions behind them,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of yellow ribbons adorned trees, traffic signs and lapels on <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> in the journalist's hometown Wednesday, the third anniversary of his kidnapping by Moslem extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` The most sacred experience is to be remembered by frends, loved ones and by God,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where prayer services were held for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` We pray that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> will be remembered today and soon delivered from his tormenters,'' <PERSON> Wolter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and has been held longer than any of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The activities in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> coincided with a national observance in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The anniversary also was marked in <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthplace, <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where a group including relatives hoisted an American flag and tied a yellow ribbon to the flagpole at City Hall `` May this be a day of miracles,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON>, who has acted as personal chaplain to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s family in recent months, said in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>. `` Please Lord, set him free.'' Journalists outnumbered the handful of churchgoers at an early morning service at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> James </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> asked reporters to put down their notebooks to join hands and pray for a colleague. At the church's midday service about 30 people heard a service by <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wolter </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Christians </PERSON> had a duty to speak up for those who suffer injustice. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> and works as a prison guard in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, urged those attending to write their congressmen to press the government to do more to win the release of the hostages. `` I'm sure <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> is thinking of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> today,'' he said. `` I know he wants more than anything to be able come back here and be with his family and friends.'' Several florists in the small city of 17,000 donated more than two miles of yellow ribbon, which was tied in bows and handed out to residents. Nearly every tree, sign post and railing along Main Street sported yellow ribbon. `` We always knew people were concerned about <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` But in the past they did n't turn out and make an effort to show it.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, has fought to free her brother since his kidnapping, but her activities did not win widespread support in her hometown until recently. `` People did n't know how to react,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, a talk show host on radio station <ORGANIZATION> WBTA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think many people opposed what <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> was doing. They just did n't know if it was the best thing to do.'' Mrs. Say, who was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and other family members have said they hope the attention will force the administration to develop a new policy.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Wednesday he's counting `` the number of votes, not the color of votes'' in the wake of his second-place showing in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> where he garnered less than 10 percent of the white vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said the four men indicted Wednesday on conspiracy charges in the Iran-Contra affair _ Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, fired national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> _ were `` fall guys.'' `` They were in fact implementing this administration's policy,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, calling the Iran-Contra affair `` a source of embarrassment to this administration and a disgrace to our country.'' Back on the subject of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> contest, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was upbeat. `` We came in a strong second in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. `` I am gratified with the response to my campaign in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> yesterday.'' `` We did well. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> did well by both of its favorite-son candiates,'' he said, when asked about pre-election polls that had showed him virtually dead even with home state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ended up with 31 percent of the vote, to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s 43 percent. Exit polls showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> overwhelming won the state's black vote, but pulled only 7 to 8 percent of white voters into his camp. That was less than the 10 percent he garnered across the Super Tuesday states on March 8, and a represented an apparent setback from his strong showings in Northern states that have black populations of 1 percent or less, including <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. When asked if that spelled trouble in the states yet to come as he tries to attract crucial white support to his campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied, `` Let's count the number of votes, not the color of votes.'' He noted he is first in the cumulative popular vote count of states that have held primaries so far, and is a close second in the delegate count to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Of 30 contests now I have come in number one or number two ... We have reason to celebrate in my campaign. We are where every campaign wants to be.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made the comments following an observance at Holy Trinity Church of the third year of captivity for American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> who is being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Earlier he had a chance meeting at National Airport with rival Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who was leaving as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was arriving. The two spoke briefly, and according to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked about party unity. Organizers of the hostage memorial said all the presidential candidates were invited to the service, which included remarks by former hostages and family members of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and others still being held. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who helped gain release of downed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in 1983, was the only one who attended. At a news conference afterward, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has `` done everything I can'' to make contacts that might secure the hostage release, but that the situation is complicated because he does not know who is holding the hostages. He criticized the administration, however, saying that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence operations should be put to work finding the location of the hostages and the identity of the captors so that negotiations for their release can begin. `` They can be found, through our intelligence network,'' he said, adding that negotiations should begin `` either directly or through our allies.'' Outside the church in the posh <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> caused a stir among Holy Trinity elementary school students, <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students and passersby who rushed out to shake his hand. The school children squealed in delight as he raced across a cobblestone street to greet them, then went to the other side to shake hands with college students who rushed out on the balconies of their brownstone homes to cheer him. `` I do n't think I'd want him to win, but I think I might vote for him. He's the only one bringing out the important issues,'' said <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaden </PERSON>, 19, a <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> student. Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went to one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s most well-known drug-trafficking neighborhoods, where he and <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> addressed a rally. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made a strong anti-drug statement, telling 300 people, `` We must stop drugs or drugs will stop the people.'' `` You must be sober and free of drugs whether you have a job or not,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said drugs are a foreign policy issue that has been dealt with inadequately by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed a major civil rights bill Wednesday, saying it would `` vastly and unjustifiably extend the power of the federal government over the decisions and affairs of private organizations.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also proposed an alternative that he said would `` protect civil rights and at the same time preserve the independence of state and local governments, the freedom of religion and the right of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s citizens to order their lives and businesses without extensive federal intrusion.'' The veto was immediately criticized by civil rights and other groups, and congressional Democrats predicted a quick override. The legislation, which had bipartisan support, passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 75-14 on Jan. 28 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 315-98 on March 2. Both votes are more than the two-thirds majority necessary to override a presidential veto. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the veto `` a kick in the teeth of civil rights It is the most regrettable and least justifiable of all the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes.'' The bill the president vetoed was designed to undo the effects of a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that, in cutting off federal funds because of illegal discrimination, the government could treat each specific `` program or activity'' separately. That meant that other parts of the institution involved could still receive federal funds. Under the bill, federal aid to the entire institution would have to be cut off in such cases. In his veto message, the president said he supported legislation to `` strengthen the civil rights coverage of educational institutions'' that were affected by the high court's decision. He said he had already endorsed legislation to do this but his new bill `` goes further than the legislation previously endorsed.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s bill is similar to one rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a vote of 266-146. The president said his bill would: _ `` Prohibit discrimination against women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and the elderly across the board in public school districts, public systems of higher education, systems of vocational education, and private educational institutions which receive any public aid. _ `` Extend the application of the civil rights statutes to entire businesses which receive federal aid as a whole and to the entire plant or facility receiving federal aid in every other instance. _ `` Prohibit discrimination in all of the federally funded programs of departments and agencies of state and local governments.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his bill `` complements well our body of existing federal civil rights laws.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, has sent me a bill that would vastly and unjustifiably expand the power of the federal government over the decisions and affairs of private organizations, such as churches and synagogues, farms, businesses, and state and local governments,'' he said. `` In the process, it would place at risk such cherished values as religious liberty.'' Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was confident the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will override the veto `` I do n't think many members will be so weak-kneed that they will change on the basis of lobbying that is now going on,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a statement that `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may want to turn the clock back on civil rights, but the American people do not ... I am confident that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will move swiftly to override this unfortunate and shortsighted veto.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership aide said the chamber would vote Thursday on overriding the veto. The House was not expected to act before Tuesday. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, chairman of the organization, issued a statement denouncing the president's action and predicting that it would be overturned. `` While we are confident that huge bipartisan majorities in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will vote to override a presidential veto, we believe strongly that this veto is not in the best interests of the country because it sends a terrible signal to the nation, especially in this bicentennial year of the Constitution,'' the statement said. `` The president sometimes expresses wonder that anyone can criticize him on his civil rights record,'' the two leaders said. `` In fact this administration is compiling the worst civil rights record of any administration in half a century.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Wednesday calling the veto `` a strong message of retreat from enforcement of laws intended to prevent discrimination based on race, sex, age and handicap.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, an association representing the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops, issued a statement saying the conference was `` deeply disappointed that the president saw fit to veto one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation to come along in many years.'' It said the bill would have done much to `` strengthen federal civil rights protection while safeguarding vital concerns about human life and religious liberty.'' The conference vowed to work `` actively'' for an override. The White House, in a statement accompanying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto message, said the administration alternative would protect religious liberty by limiting coverage to the part of a church or synagogue that participates in a federal program. The statement said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bill would provide that when a religious secondary or elementary school receives federal assistance, only that school, and not the entire religious school system, would become subject to federal regulation. The statement said the measure would `` ensure that the reach of the federal regulation into private businesses extends only to the facility that participates in federally funded programs, unless the business as a whole receives federal aid, in which case it is covered in its entirety.'' It said the administration bill also states explicitly that farmers will not become subject to federal regulation by accepting federal price support payments and that grocers and supermarkets would not be afgfected because they accept food stamps from customers. It said the independence of state and local governments would be preserved because federal regulation would be limited to the part of a state or local entity that receives or distributes federal assistance. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday he believed the bill would attract the support of `` a large number'' of senators and representatives.

<HEAD>Official: More Soviets Receiving Visas to Visit, Live Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More Soviets are applying to visit or live abroad and fewer of them are being refused permission, a Soviet official said Wednesday. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Apatov </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> police department's visa office, told Soviet journalists that 82 percent of Soviets who apply to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are granted permission. About 200 people have been turned down, he said. He did not break the number down into travel and emigration requests or provide an overall figure. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency carried reports on <PERSON> Apatov </PERSON>'s briefing. <PERSON> Apatov </PERSON> said citizens were refused permission either because of their access to state secrets or because they could not satisfy their relatives' financial demands. He said those not allowed to leave because of their alleged access to state secrets can reapply, usually after six months. Many Soviet Jews say officials abuse the law that says people can not leave if they know state secrets or are needed by their families for financial reasons. Western sources say more than 8,000 Soviet Jews were allowed to emigrate in 1987, after several years when emigration was held to about 1,000 a year. Emigration reached its peak in 1979, when more than 51,000 people left. <PERSON> Apatov </PERSON> said a reduction in the paperwork needed to travel abroad also prompted more Soviets to apply for permission for trips. The number of people applying to travel to capitalist countries increased 93 percent in the first two months of 1988, <PERSON> Apatov </PERSON> said. The number of people refused such permission fell 44 percent in 1987 from the previous year, he said, without providing specific figures. A fee imposed on those leaving for capitalist and developing countries has been halved to 200 rubles -LRB- about $ 320 -RRB-, <PERSON> Apatov </PERSON> said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> took the stand at his impeachment trial Wednesday and said that he did not protect an aide accused of making a death threat and did not sell appointments for campaign contributions. The governor, portraying himself as a naive victim of political enemies who skewered him with bad publicity, said the public never saw him as `` the nice guy I really am.'' `` I've learned a lot,'' he said in his first appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial, which opened Feb. 29. The first-term Republican was scheduled to return to the stand on Thursday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades. Wednesday's session was his first return to the seat of state government in more than a month. He is accused of trying to obstruct an investigation of an alleged death threat against a former aide who was about to testify in an investigation of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s finances. He is also charged with concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan and misusing $ 80,000 in state money by loaning it to his auto dealership. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has denied wrongdoing. The 192-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gallery was jammed as <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> took the stand. Senators remained standing as he took an oath to tell the truth. Defense attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> asked whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> intended to protect the aide accused of making the death threat, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. `` Protect him from what?'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> asked. `` I've heard those allegations. I wish somebody would tell me what I protected him from.'' Craft mentioned a conversation in which <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was alleged to have ordered the state's top law enforcement officer to resist the attorney general's investigation of the alleged threat. `` Were you intending to do anything to protect <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> -LRB- in that conversation -RRB-?'' asked Craft. `` Not in the least,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has claimed he was inadequately informed about the death threat allegation. He has acknowledged he may have told the state's top police official, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, to resist the attorney general's efforts to investigate. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has said he cooperated with the attorney general. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on Wednesdsay also denied allegations that he rewarded fund-raisers with jobs. `` Money was never an object and it was never used as a criteria to get a job,'' he said. The governor also denied that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was his biggest fund-raiser, saying <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> `` brought in some loans'' but not a huge amount in contributions. Last week, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide, had testified that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was protected by the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration because of his fund-raising. She said that when she once complained about <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' position in the governor's inner circle she was told by the governor's then-chief of staff: `` We have to take care of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> He raised a lot of money for the campaign.'' Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former appointments secretary, had testified that campaign contributions were a criterion, although not a major one, in making appointments to state boards and commissions. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> also testified that he did not immediately realize that two proposed appointees to the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had been recommended by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, who provided a $ 350,000 campaign loan to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a millionaire auto dealer, said Wednesday that he himself was his biggest campaign contributor. `` Unfortunately I always have been,'' he said of his political career, which included four previous runs for governor before his successful 1986 campaign. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also seized the opportunity to complain of being misunderstood on one of his first official acts, elimination of the state's Martin Luther King holiday. He said that his action was mandated by the attorney general and that he replaced a paid state holiday with an unpaid `` recognition day.'' `` What we did was tell peoiple we in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> believe in civil rights for all people,'' he said. Shortly before <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> appeared, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resoundingly voted down a motion to dismiss the charges. The senators also defeated defense motions to declare a mistrial or to hold a hearing on defense claims of witness tampering. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, noted that claims by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers that the state police were intimidating witnesses were under investigation by law enforcement agencies. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a perennial political outsider who won election in a three-way race, has been staying at suburban <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> offices he calls his `` government in exile.'' He retains his salary and is referred to as governor during the impeachment proceedings, but Mofford has gubernatorial power pending the outcome of the trial. It would take a two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and remove him from office. The senators could then take another vote and bar him for life from holding state office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a criminal trial April 21 on charges he concealed the $ 350,000 loan, and a recall election is scheduled for May 17.

 Reputed druglord <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> interrupted his smuggling trial Wednesday to say he had evidence the chief prosecutor was blackmailing the judge, an allegation the prosecutor called `` high comedy.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said the man who sent the letter to <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> had `` mental problems'' and had made similar allegations about authorities in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, where he had been convicted on extortion and racketeering charges. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> read the letter and said he had also received previous letters from the man. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, charged with smuggling tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, rose as the court was breaking for a mid-morning recess. `` Your honor, I would like to disclose that I have received evidence that Mr. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> is blackmailing Judge <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and I'd like to present it,'' he said. `` This is high comedy,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said as <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said he'd like to hear any such evidence. The statement apparently was unexpected even by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s attorneys It resulted in quick recesses so they could confer with their client. The letter-writer's name was not revealed in court. `` This individual is familiar to me. He has mental problems,'' said the prosecutor. `` I do not intend for the integrity of this court, nor the prosecutor to be impugned,'' the judge said of the allegations. `` I would categorically say that at this time, they are absolutely untrue.'' The judge gave the defense until Thursday morning to file any motions they might want to make concerning the material. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> said the information had been filed by the letter writer with a federal appeals court and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wanted to just call it to the judge's attention so that something can be done about it,'' said <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said his client had no personal knowledge about the source of the information. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, reputed to be one of the leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, is on trial on charges he and others conspired to import some 3.3 tons of the drug into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>.

 A state agency cited <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for six safety violations and fined the aerospace company $ 31,700 Wednesday in a fire in an MX missile motor assembly building Dec. 29 that killed five workers. The victims' presence in the building and failure to use remote-control equipment instead at the time of the fire were among the most serious violations alleged by the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The penalties represent the maximum that could be imposed, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McVey </PERSON>, UOSH administrator. The contractor has 30 days to appeal the citations and penalties to the independent <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UOSH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Three violations were deemed willful and serious, two were deemed serious and one was `` other than serious.'' In a statement late Wednesday, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> said that it is `` confident that the facts will not substantiate any conscious or knowing violation of the act'' and that it will challenge the citations. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> described many of the alleged violations as `` random instances unknown to company management, which reflect a failure of some employees to follow all rules established by the company.'' The company said increased supervision and stricter enforcement of the company's discipline program have been instituted as a remedy. The workers were withdrawing the core from a casting of the first stage of an MX missile when 100,000 pounds of solid fuel ignited in a fireball. The blaze caused $ 6.2 million in damage to the plant 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> makes the missile's four stages, and also makes the space shuttle's solid-fuel rocket boosters, which failed when the Challenger blew up in January 1986. The fire at <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> Division has held up production of the MX missile until the cause of the fire can be determined and corrected. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigators, in a briefing Wednesday, blamed either static electricity or friction, perhaps from grit, as the probable cause of the fire, said Art Kingdom, a spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>. Another theory is that as the propellant was compressed, its chemistry changed, making it more volatile, <PERSON> Kingdom </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McVey </PERSON> said state investigators agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s findings, although his division's investigation focused on safety regulations, not the cause Results of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation were scheduled to be made public Thursday, but members of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation were briefed a day in advance. UOSH alleged that workmen were removing the core from an engine manually rather than by remote control. The cores, or metal forms, are removed after the propellant has been poured into the casing and allowed to harden. The agency also said protective walls and barricades were not provided, and proper precautions against static electricty were n't taken In addition, it said, dual controls for a hydraulic system were not interlocked to prevent unintentional operations, and employees entering the explosive material area did not turn over all prohibited articles, such as coins and keys. Also, an unauthorized crowbar was in a restricted area, <ORGANIZATION> UOSH </ORGANIZATION> said. Kingdom said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> recommended better electrical grounding, increased humidity and more care in withdrawing cores from engines. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the fire destroyed one of three missile engine cores. Investigators said two completed castings are awaiting withdrawal of the cores before the engines can be shipped to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Kingdom said. Kingdom said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had indicated it needed the engines within the two months to continue its MX test program.

<TEXT>
 Former Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> kicked in the door of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s fabled backroom politics nearly a decade ago, unsmiling and unafraid of mixing it up with the Democratic machine's big boys. But after her third straight electoral setback, this one for clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and viewed by many political observers as the first step in a comeback bid, Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> apparently is calling it quits. `` When we say the people spoke,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said of Tuesday's primary defeat, `` they apparently shouted `` And therefore,'' she added, `` I'm very good at taking hints.'' `` I truly believe that politically it's all over for me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said Wednesday before leaving for <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. She headed west for `` some rest and relaxation,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pecor </PERSON>, her campaign manager Asked whether she would run again, he said, `` Where she is concerned, one should never say never.'' `` She has demonstrated time and again that she has a very solid core of support running somewhere between 35 -LRB- percent -RRB- and 40 percent of the Democrats in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the county.'' But that was n't enough to stave off the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s upset bid in the three-way 1983 Democratic mayoral primary, and it was n't enough when she tried to avenge that loss against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year It turned out be too little again Tuesday when she lost to <PERSON> Aurelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, endorsed by the party organization that Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> once held, vise-like, in her grip. And this latest loss came in a race rich with resonance and names _ <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> `` Fast Eddie'' <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> _ that speak to the past, present and perhaps even the future of <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s quirky Democratic politics. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a former debutante with a flair for the dramatic, became the city's first woman mayor in 1979, scoring a rags-to-riches victory after campaigning against the political machine of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. She defeated the machine's candidate, then-Mayor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilandic </PERSON>, with the help of much of the city's machine-weary blacks, but later made peace with the regular Democrats. Included in that group were several aldermen Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had railed against as members of `` an evil cabal,'' most notably <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aurelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>'s father and one of the machine's most loyal servants. But she paid dearly for cozying up to the old guard, as well as for several other moves _ replacing blacks with whites on the school board, then handing out hams at public-housing projects as the 1983 election neared. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, galvanizing the black vote, turned her out of office and became the city's first black mayor. He spent the next four years retooling the party machinery to fit his needs, then became the first two-term mayor since <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> by handily beating back successive challenges from Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> last February in the primary and then <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, running as a third-party candidate, in April. After <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death in November, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> became mayor. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, saying the party under <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had become untenable, completed his move away from the Democratic organization last year. Running as a Republican, he was unopposed in Tuesday's primary for court clerk In the meantime, Ms. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, an attorney and Metropolitan Sanitary District commissioner, stepped out of her father's shadow and was welcomed into the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> camp. So much so that she may have beaten <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> in Tuesday's race on the strength of her showing among <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s blacks, who helped propel her to a 52 percent to 38 percent victory over Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> with nearly all the votes counted. Two other candidates, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a follower of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, split the rest of the vote. Ms. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> defeated Ms. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> in the 1986 Democratic primary for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> secretary of state's office, won that November by Republican <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s defeat spoiled an anticipated Byrne-Vrdolyak struggle in the fall, a match of two former titans for an obscure office both hoped would lead to bigger things.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> resigned Thursday as leader of his party in an attempt to unite the opposition before <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections expected in April. He said he was stepping down because his presence as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> was blocking unification and because he failed to win the Dec. 16 presidential elections. `` I have keenly felt guilty,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said in a statement read by a party vice president, <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sook </PERSON>, who said she would be acting party president. The statement made no mention of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s future plans. He did not make the statement himself because he was ill, party officials said. Efforts to unite Peace and Democracy with the rival <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> collapsed last week when <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> refused the other party's demand that he resign. It was not clear if his resignation Thursday would clear the way for the opposition to unite. The Reunification Democratic leadership met after <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s announcement to consider its response. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> acted after the Reunification Democrats moved to unite with three smaller opposition parties. Many opposition supporters are angry that the two main opposition parties have failed to join together, and party leaders fear a major loss of support. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and his supporters split from the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to form the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> late last year after he and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' leader, failed to agree on who should run for president Both Kims ran and were defeated by the government party's nominee, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who became president Feb. 25 Opposition supporters blamed the two Kims for the defeat because they split the opposition vote. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> resigned as <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> president in February to clear the way for the two parties to unite. Unity talks ran into problems over leadership and political goals and collapsed. The opposition is concerned it will suffer a major defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections expected April 26.

 The Security Council unanimously urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Wednesday to commute the sentences of the `` <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six,'' sentenced to be executed for a 1984 death by mob violence. Its resolution asked for a stay of the executions, scheduled for Friday, and said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s `` practice'' of executing opponents of apartheid has harmed the search for peace. On Tuesday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issued a personal appeal for the lives of the six. They were convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black township councilman stoned and burned to death in the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> township south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. An appeals court judge ruled that they did not kill him personally but had common purpose with the mob. <PERSON> Dragoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pejic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president for March, said death sentences for the `` African patriots'' had caused `` undivided international condemnation and uproar.'' He also said thousands of innocent black South Africans have been detained and tortured. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> sent a telegram to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> asking mercy be shown the five men and one woman on humanitarian grounds. He said clemency would help reduce tensions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where 5 million whites control the government and the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The council resolution spoke of the `` <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> racist regime's decision to execute the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six ... in defiance of worldwide appeals. Ambassador <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> issued a statement criticizing the council, which frequently condemns his country. He said the government `` strongly objects'' to council action that interferes `` not only in an internal South African matter but also a matter which is the result of the due process of law.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` is not insensitive to the feelings aroused by capital punishment but must respect the independence of the country's judicial system,'' his statement said. `` Murder is a common law crime. It has nothing to do with the color of a person's skin. It said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> courts `` are highly respected'' and that there are few countries `` if any, where the courts enjoy a higher degree of independence from the executive authority.'' This was the council's second action in a week of a resolution condemning apartheid, the official South African policy of race discrimination. Last Tuesday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> vetoed a resolution that would have imposed economic sanctions. Wednesday's resolution said the executions would `` further inflame an already grave situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' It urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to commute the sentences and asked all countries and organizations to `` use influence and take urgent measures to save the lives of the ` <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six'.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are permanent members of the council, with veto power. Other nations currently serving are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>.

 Federal authorities in at least two states are investigating whether <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> tried to arrange an arms shipment to <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> forces loyal to him, according to federal officials and other sources. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chief American attorney denied the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president was involved in any arms shipments. `` That's a dry well for you, my friend,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There's no truth to that allegation.'' Word that authorities were pressing such an investigation surfaced here last week when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in sentencing a defendant in an arms smuggling case here, referred to a continuing probe. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzblau </PERSON>, an attorney for the defendant, <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morua </PERSON>, said Tuesday that federal agents had asked his client about <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` They asked a lot of times about if whether we had anything to tie up <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to this transaction,'' he said, adding that <PERSON> Morua </PERSON> was unable to provide such a link. <PERSON> Morua </PERSON> was charged with three others in a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sting operation stemming from the alleged arms deal. No arms were alleged to have changed hands. However, officials said the shipment would have supplied automatic rifles and submachine guns for an 80-member force. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>, a disbarred <PERSON> Hewlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, attorney, was convicted of conspiring to export weapons. The two others were acquitted. <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> was sentenced to four years in prison. <PERSON> Morua </PERSON> received a two-year term. During the trial, the government said the arms were destined for <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, but two federal officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that the weapons were believed headed for pro-Marcos forces in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Pro-Marcos elements failed in at least two coup attempts in 1987. During <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>'s trial, the prosecutor said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> had worked with <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> on the proposed arms shipment. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, who was not charged, and <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> have been linked to <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporter and former provincial governor later connected by Philippine military sources to an August 1987 coup attempt against the government of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' successor, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> was questioned by police on the grounds of a Marcos-owned estate in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> in August 1986. He said <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>, whom he identified as his lawyers, told him to clean up the estate. He was not arrested. A newspaper in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said last week that <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> was contacted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities who traveled there seeking his cooperation in an investigation of alleged arms shipments to pro-Marcos groups. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Monday confirmed that he met with <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> last week, but said he could not comment further because of an `` ongoing criminal investigation.'' <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabe </PERSON>, deputy chief of mission at the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> before being deported to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, where he faced charges in the 1986 slayings of three presidential campaign workers for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since his 1986 ouster. He has said he wishes to return to his homeland. Last year, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen testified before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had sought to buy weapons for shipment to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in June, four months after <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>'s arrest. They played for the panel secretly taped conversations with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. It could not be determined if the alleged coup attempt, the <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> case and the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> investigation were directly related. Neither <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, head of Customs' <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office, would comment on the case. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, Customs director of illegal export investigations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also would not comment. On Monday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> issued a statement denying he wanted to resume power `` through violent means.'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> did not return repeated phone messages left this week and last at his <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Soldiers tried to overthrow Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Wednesday but they were overpowered, and thousands of people poured into the streets in the largest protest yet of his continued rule. Many workers are broke in a country that uses <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars as its currency but has almost none of them. Street corners in poor neighborhoods were dotted with burning barricades Wednesday. The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said the coup attempt apparently was led by Col. <PERSON> Leonidas </PERSON> <PERSON> Macias </PERSON>, head of the national police. He was arrested along with three majors, a captain and some civilians, the communique said. Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, head of the military press office, said `` no more than eight or nine'' officers were involved in the revolt. He said there were no casualties but did not say what happened to officers not listed among those arrested. It was the first sign of trouble within <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which had kept a solid front through nine months of civil unrest caused by accusations that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in crimes ranging from drug trafficking to political assassination. He was indicted on drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commision </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises operation of the 50-mile waterway between the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans, said dockworkers' strikes and an electricity shutoff had not impeded ship passage. The canal has its own electrical generating capacity. But operations stopped on the Trans-Panama pipeline, which carries about 650,000 barrels of Alaskan crude oil a day across the isthmus for delivery to <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> markets. The pipeline relies on local power and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the line lacked electricity to drive the pumps. <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Sohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> own up to three-quarters of the oil that flows through the line and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> owns the rest, comprising about 10 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has put pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants him `` out of there.'' Sanctions such as freezing Panamanian accounts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and withholding <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> fees created a cash shortage that makes it impossible to pay the 130,000 public employees. Flaming barricades blocked hundreds of streets on the third day of the latest public protest. By midafternoon, police and military units began reappearing in the city. Many protesters identified themselves as `` civilistas'' _ members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of about 200 business, professional, labor, student and opposition groups. The Crusade was formed last June to lead the campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which include the military and police. By midafternoon, the demonstrators were dispersed, buses and taxis stopped running and the city was virtually deserted, with most shops closed. Widespread looting broke out downtown, mostly by youths. Reporters said men in civilian clothes fired pistols and rifles at demonstrators from four-wheel-drive vehicles. Opponents have accused the government of using hired thugs or plainclothes security agents to break up protests. Electricity went out in most of the country after workers at the state power company joined the protests at midday. Local telephone service was sporadic. Protesters chanted `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go!'' and `` <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>, tyrant, your end is near!'' Residents near the Defense Forces headquarters heard the clatter of light arms fire inside the walled compound beginning at about 8:15 a.m. It continued for at least half an hour.

 The housing industry, after staggering for two months following the October stock market crash, enjoyed a sharp 8.9 percent increase in construction activity in February, the biggest gain in more than a year, the government reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase pushed construction of single-family homes and apartments up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units last month following declines of 15.8 percent in December and 1.9 percent in January. Those back-to-back setbacks, coupled with three consecutive monthly declines in new home sales, had raised concerns because housing is often the first industry to weaken at the onset of a new recession. Economists feared that potential home buyers had grown wary following the record collapse of the stock market in October.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON> left his post at the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 20 years ago little dreaming he would return this winter trying to mend relations shattered by martial law and a foreign debt that is still rising. `` I keep pretty busy,'' says <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON>, a junior diplomat at the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 1964-68 and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the military crackdown against the independent Solidarity trade union in December 1981. <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Romuald </PERSON> <PERSON> Spasowski </PERSON>, defected to protest martial law So far, <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON> is having better luck winning friends for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s officials than its businessmen and bankers. `` We are delighted with Ambassador <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON>,'' said Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, who has traveled twice to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since martial law was lifted in 1983. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, described <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON>'s immediate previous post, deputy foreign minister, as analagous to his own job as No. 2 in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON>, like many Poles, is a chain smoker, and nicotine stains the thick glasses through which he pores over reams of finanicial statistics. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, which was $ 25.5 billion in 1981, rose to $ 39. billion by Dec. 31, 1987, driven higher by the collapsing dollar and a lack of quality exports. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has lifted the freeze it imposed on new credits to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during martial law, but <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is still such a bad risk that Western bankers balk at offering any new loans. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who just became the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since 1982, said in a televised interview last week that Polish authorities appeared genuinely interested in economic reforms. `` If economic reform is in place, and we see that it is in place, it may be that there are some opportunities for joint ventures, or other means of being helpful,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> took one step toward better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by closing down a business enterprise affiliated with the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> terrorist organization last fall and ordering the two men in charge to leave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in January. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-terrorism experts say they are watching the situation carefully. And <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say more American help might be forthcoming if Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> reached political accommodation with Solidarity and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help would follow liberalization,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The billions of dollars <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> received in credit in the 1970's, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, `` went down the drain through a combination of bad luck and bad management,'' creating the economic crisis that spawned Solidarity in August 1980. But <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON> said in a recent interview in his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is looking not for new long-term credits but for short-term commercial credits to facilitate transactions. `` Ninety-five percent of our -LRB- foreign -RRB- purchases are cash,'' he said. `` No other country in the world is buying machines and durable goods for cash.'' A Polish trade delegation which visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Feb. 14 for the 10th session of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American-Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ the first such meeting since 1981 _ went home with friendly words instead of dollars. One deal under discussion is the purchase or rental by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s state-owned Lot airlines of two or three jets from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The planes would fly between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, and money from tickets sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would pay for the planes, say Polish officials. There are geopolitical overtones in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s latest turn toward the West. Lot grounded its fleet of eight Soviet-made Ilyushin 62 jets, the best <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has to offer, after one crashed last May near <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, killing all 183 people aboard. A government commission blamed a faulty roller bearing for the crash, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst, and the weekly <PERSON> Przeglad </PERSON> <PERSON> Tygodniowy </PERSON> recently complained that the IL-62 is more costly to operate, and requires more maintenance, than other jetliners. <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, like other Soviet bloc countries, is seeking joint ventures with the West, and may be willing to waive previous requirements, allowing private Polish firms to take part, allowing the Western firm to own more than half the joint venture, and relaxing rules and taking hard currency out of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is seeking Western help in the agricultural sector, as well. On Feb. 20, the <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, created with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' Fund, was opening up a $ 2.4 million-line of credit for private farmers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to stimulate the export of hams

<HEAD>Pastor-Congregation Conflicts Are Common Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICKI BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two weeks after he became pastor of a Southern Baptist church in west-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said he knew the congregation might end up firing him. It did. Getting along with a congregation is a common challenge for clergy, particularly in the Baptist system. The congregation which ousted Price, he found later, had fired five previous staff members. It was plagued with financial problems and had split over the issue of speaking in tongues. Price, who now is minister of education at <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> here, said being fired devastated him and his family. But he said he found comfort in Scripture and help from friends and family in relocating. The Southern Baptist Convention, in which churches have local autonomy and can simply fire a pastor, has concluded the problem is severe enough to set up a special program to help fired pastors. Other denominations have found that maintaining good relations between the pastor and congregation, as well as among members, often takes some effort. But in most denominations, a pastor ca n't simply be fired by the congregation The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> discovered in 1984 that 88 ministers were fired by their churches each month, said <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who coordinates a program to help fired ministers. `` We found that pastors who had been terminated had great need, both for a job and emotional support,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Being terminated does not change that pastor's internal spiritual awareness that <PERSON> God </PERSON> has called him into the ministry.'' Previously, he said, there was no clear place for pastors to turn for financial or emotional help. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> tries to make sure they receive counseling if they need it, and seeks to put them in touch with others who can help in finding another job, if it appears they were unjustly fired. State conventions have funds to help with financial needs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> works with churches such as <ORGANIZATION> Highview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, which have established temporary paid staff positions to help terminated ministers rebuild their careers. In the Methodist, Episcopal, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Lutheran churches, severe problems between a pastor and church are referred to the bishop or someone else within the church hierarchy. Those churches have structures to investigate problems and work to remedy them. In the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, problems can be referred to a pastor-parish relations committee, or the bishop. A Methodist pastor can be transferred, or suspended, if convicted in a church trial of some serious offense, such as immorality. In the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, pastors can be removed only through joint action of the parish governing body, the vestry, and diocesan bishop. The Rev. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, vicar general of the <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION>, said problems between priest and congregation would go to a parish-pastoral council and then the bishop, but a parish by itself ca n't fire a priest. The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod has a full-time consultant on a `` Peace in the Parish'' program, aimed at improving relations between pastors and congregations and among members. The Rev. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Grotelusuhen </PERSON>, president of the denomination's <ORGANIZATION> Mid-South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said a congregation can fire a pastor for particular causes, but he would investigate `` If you can get in early enough, you usually can defuse it; if you come in late, it will more likely lead to a termination,'' he said. `` Sometimes it's the pastor's fault, sometimes the church,'' he said. Problems can arise over the pastor not spending enough time visiting the sick and bereaved, or having difficulty administering congregational affairs. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualben </PERSON>, a Lutheran, has for three years conducted sessions on such problems with church officials and ministers from Lutheran, Episcopal and Methodist churches. He said that when he is asked to help resolve a problem in a congregation, he starts by reviewing its value system, and how past difficulties may come back as old angers and old hurts operating within the congregation. `` I went to one church that had split over slavery in 1872,'' he said. `` The descendants of the slavery congregation still sit on one side of the church, while the descendants of the non-slavery congregation still sit on the other side.'' <PERSON> Qualben </PERSON> said he tries to help the church get a longer range perspective for making wise decisions and coping with the past without hoarding hurts. But eliminating all conflict does n't square with human nature, he said. `` If the absence of conflict is the mark of a successful church then the disciples never qualified.'' But he said conciliating efforts often bring `` new life, new vitality of mutual ministry in the church.''

<TEXT>
 When three whooping cranes flew out of a tidal marsh, sounds of awe mixed with the clicking of cameras on the deck of the Lucky Day. The three birds made up nearly 2 percent of the entire population of their kind. `` Flying whooping cranes at 9 o'clock,'' Capt. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloat </PERSON> told the 80 passengers, his second tour group of the day on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. `` They're showing off their wing tips for you.'' Each year, it gets a little easier to spot the birds at the <ORGANIZATION> Aransas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, which is celebrating its 50th aniversary. There are about 195 whoopers in the world today; in 1941, the population had dwindled to 15. The decline came as habitats were developed for farms and cities, while hunters helped to nearly finish off the species. Whooping cranes made Aransas famous, but when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created the coastal preserve in 1937, the legislation did not mention the bird known scientifically as Grus americana. `` This refuge was not established to protect whooping cranes,'' said refuge biologist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehn </PERSON>. `` It was established to protect waterfowl habitat.'' The government saw the need to protect less spectacular game birds, such as ducks and geese. Whooping cranes just happened to be lucky enough to share the same area during the winter. Their precarious situation by 1945 prompted the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to work on rescuing the birds from extinction. `` Without the Aransas refuge, I think it's pretty evident the whooping crane would have become extinct,'' <PERSON> Stehn </PERSON> said, while observing an unusual gathering of 14 whoopers in the same field. He called it `` just phenomenal to be able to see that many whooping cranes from one location, to think that at one point there were only 15 in the entire flock.'' Scientists do n't think the whooping crane population ever exceeded 5,000, he said. Only about 8,000 acres on the refuge provide the marshy winter habitat whooping cranes use to look for food including plants, clams, snakes, crabs, snails, fish, worms and insects. Several other endangered species make the refuge their home. They include the bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon, Attwater's prairie chicken, <LOCATION> jaguarundi </LOCATION> and Eskimo curlew. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> whooping crane flock numbers 132 this year, a 79 percent increase in four years. Virtually all are on or near the 54,829-acre refuge. They migrate each winter to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Wood Buffalo National Park 2,400 miles away. Eighteen to 20 whoopers live among sandhill cranes that migrate between <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They were introduced as chicks into the sandhill families, but none have started breeding. A third group of 41 lives in captivity at the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Patuxent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Lone specimens of whooping crane also live at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baraboo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. With their population steadily growing, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> whoopers have started spreading to a 44,000-acre state park and refuge on nearby <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is buying an additional 11,502 acres at the southern end of <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> from The Nature Conservancy. That will add important new habitat as the territorial whooping cranes spread out. `` We're really encouraged by the land that they're adding'' because wildlife is rapidly losing ground, said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>, biologist and manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sanctuaries. `` We're not creating habitat. We're just saving little pieces of what's left.'' Whooper pairs, mated for life, stake out winter territories and return to the same claims each year. The birds stand nearly 5 feet tall and have wings spanning about 7 -LCB- feet. Adults are snowy white, with black wingtips and red crowns on their heads. Immature whooping cranes are rusty red and white with black wing tips. Males breed at about the age 3, while females wait until they're about 5. In <LOCATION> Rockport </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Sloat </PERSON>'s Lucky Day and four other whooping crane tour boats are based, the endangered bird means money for the local economy. Just a couple of years ago, only two whooping crane boats were operating. `` You have people that are staying in motels and eating and seeing other things while they are here'' to see the whooping cranes, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockport-Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has an economic impact on our community, there's no doubt.'' Some estimate the refuge brings up to $ 5 million to the local economy. Refuge officials, however, worry about its location on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, a man-made channel that cuts right through the whooping crane habitat. Some 1,485 acres of habitat have been lost since 1941 due to construction of the canal and erosion caused by boat wakes. Regular barge traffic leaves oil, grease, cadmium, arsenic, nickel and mercury, while many of the barges carry deadly cargo. `` There is some nasty stuff going through that canal,'' said refuge manager <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Giezentanner </PERSON>. `` You're carrying very toxic chemicals within 100 yards of the cranes. If we have one barge break open some time, we potentially could have a major portion of the whooping crane habitat contaminated.''

 Remember 20 years ago? Black-and-white television, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, campus unrest, sexual revolution, hippies, flower children? Other events shook the earth, too. Growing up, for instance. In <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years,'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> is 12 years old in 1968. He has to be careful of the neighborhood bully, namely his older brother. His father is a distant figure who shows up now and then to straighten him out. The offstage narrator is <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> as a grownup, looking back and remembering. Of course, remembering it in his own fashion. `` The Wonder Years,'' simply put, is wonderful. Every adult out there who has ever grown up will identify with this awkward age. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Hervey </PERSON> is his older brother, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Abo </PERSON> is his sister, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>. The midseason replacement series being given a limited trial by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has been given a Tuesday night spot between `` Who's The Boss'' and `` Moonlighting.'' `` 1968 was a year when a lot of amazing things took place,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, creator and executive producer with her husband, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marlens </PERSON> also created <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Growing Pains.'' `` We were about that age that year. There were a lot of really disruptive events in the background of a kid's life.'' <PERSON> Marlens </PERSON> said, `` It's different when you're 12. You know things are happening, but you're not quite sure about them. It struck us as an interesting time. There were already retrospectives about people who were a little older, like ` The Big Chill.''' `` When you're young you do n't have a context in which to place things,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> added. ` It's just part of the world. It's a time when you get your first impression of life.'' It's also a time when a self-conscious 12-year-old is more interested in figuring out how he fits in. You can put it into context later. At 12 you just want to blend in. Black admits `` The Wonder Years'' is not really about the 1960s. ` It's the problems a kid has with his older brother, his father, his girlfriend,'' she said. `` The period is more of a backdrop than the essence of the show.'' Black and <PERSON> Marlens </PERSON> share common backgrounds. Both were raised in the suburbs, he outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and she outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Both had older brothers. They met while students at <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. They started writing together about 6 years ago. He was working as a newspaper reporter in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and she was a graduate student. `` We wrote a spec script for ` <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION>,' which had just gone off the air,'' said <PERSON> Marlens </PERSON>. `` We felt it was better to write for a show that was n't on the air. It got good response.'' <PERSON> Marlens </PERSON> wrote for `` Oh Madeline'' and `` <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>.'' Then he created `` Growing Pains'' while <PERSON> Black </PERSON> wrote the movie `` Soul Man.'' Actually, they worked together on both projects, but thought it best to separate the credit. They also stress that `` The Wonder Years'' is not autobiographical. `` I was never a 12-year-old boy,'' said <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. `` And <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> was never this particular 12-year-old boy.'' `` We make up the specifics,'' said <PERSON> Marlens </PERSON>, `` but we do use incidents from our lives and those of our friends. It's the story of a family, but it's seen from the viewpoint of the boy. `` We did n't set out to do anything deep. ` Leave It To Beaver' in its day was well thought out. But I think audiences today want to be challenged by something more substantial. We grew up in a controversial period and we're more prone to writing that way. But there are some things about growing up that never change. Things that happened to the Cleavers could happen to the <LOCATION> Arnolds </LOCATION>, too.''

 As they file their tax returns this year, many savers and investors are making a decision by omission _ skipping any contribution for 1987 to their individual retirement accounts. A recent study commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> found that less than half the respondents with IRAs from previous years planned to add any money to them this time around. Their reasoning is n't hard to understand. The tax deduction for contributions has been eliminated for anybody covered by an employer's retirement plan who has income of $ 35,000 or more -LRB- $ 50,000 for married couples filing joint returns -RRB-. In the $ 25,000 - $ 35,000 income range -LRB- $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 for married couples -RRB-, only part of the contribution is deductible All working Americans are still eligible to put up to $ 2,000 each year in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, whether they can claim the deduction or not. The interest, dividends or capital gains their money earns can still compound without being taxed until withdrawals from the account begin. However, money invested in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> _ including non-deductible contributions _ ca n't be withdrawn before the year in which you reach age 59 -LCB- without incurring a penalty tax. Why tie the money up, people seem to be concluding, if the incentive of the up-front deduction no longer exists? Besides, the new rules have taken the simplicity of the old system and replaced it with a lot of paperwork hassles. What's the point of spending extra time or professional preparers' fees on a venture whose after-tax value is less than it was before? These are sensible questions, to be sure. But some advisers suggest that many people who are no longer eligible for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deductions give the matter some extra consideration. After all, they say, no matter what happens with the tax law, the need to save and plan for retirement has n't changed. `` The discipline of automatic, annual contributions is especially useful to people who spend instead of save,'' says <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, tax partner at the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They need only ask themselves if they can afford to invest cash for many years. If the answer is yes, IRAs should be considered an effective investment.'' For anyone who does make non-deductible contributions, good record-keeping is a must to avoid paying taxes on that money twice _ now, and again when you make withdrawals from the account. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> requires that any non-deductible contributions be reported on the new Form 8606, which the taxpayer attaches to his or her return for the year in question. You will probably want to save a file of extra copies of Form 8606s for 1987 and subsequent years, or start a notebook, to serve as documentation for when you start taking money out of your IRA. Although this paperwork may be burdensome, it can make a big difference in the taxes you will have to pay in the future. Suppose at some point around the year 2000 you have accumulated $ 100,000 in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, of which $ 25,000 came from non-deductible contributions, and you want to withdraw $ 20,000 from the account. Since 25 percent of the total value of your <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is money that has already been taxed, having the proper records will enable you to establish that you owe taxes on only $ 15,000 of the distribution, rather than the full $ 20,000.

 Americans are accustomed to hearing <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> chiefs discourse on the threat of inflation, but some might have been mystified by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s reference to it this week. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that a further decline in the jobless rate, now 5.7 percent, might produce upward pressure on wages _ and, since wages are a large constituent of prices, the probability of inflation. How can that be, many Americans are asking? How can there be a worker shortage when 7 million members of the labor force are without jobs? How can there be a labor shortage when the jobless rate is so much above the old 4 percent `` full employment'' standard? And how can inflation, which is usually associated with a boiling economy, be a threat at a time when expansion is so sluggish at times it takes the most sophisticated statistical measures to catch any movement at all? <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s reference to the subject is bound to be passed off by some as a mere requirement of the office, a ritual expression that is now expected of a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman, since his predecessor had made it the No. 1 enemy. But there is more to it than that. The most significant `` more'' involves a better understanding of market forces than existed back in the 1960s, when it was generally believed that unemployment could drop to 4 percent before inflation flared. Experience taught otherwise, as witness the decade of inflation that followed in the 1970s. The second `` more'' involves the makeup of the labor force. In the 1960s, the economy had lots of younger workers to fill the beginning jobs. In the 1980s there are fewer labor-force entrants. And <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering sharp increases in the minimum wage. Stated differently, most of those who are available to take jobs today are older and more experienced and thus come at higher prices. You do n't need a decline to 4 percent before worrying about inflation. You worry at 5 percent. In truth, there is no certainty among economists on the point at which a falling jobless rate becomes inflationary. Clearly, they were wrong in putting it at 4 percent in the 1960s, because double-digit inflation ensued. It can be argued, therefore, that it is merely wisdom and responsibility that causes a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief always to be vigilant, and for him to act on the theory it is wiser to ward off inflation than to treat the infection later. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that in his opinion the country is getting close to the point at which inflation could be ignited. `` Certainly it's less than a percentage point,'' he said, adding that it was his impression that the flare point was `` closer to a half, and maybe somewhat less than that.'' Is he premature in his concern? Hardly, if you consider that the last big bout of inflation was one of the worst and longest the country has ever experienced, and that it took a harsh recession to defeat it. Consider also that a case of inflation in the range of 6 percent _ mild, when compared with the double-digit disasters of the 1970s _ can cut in half the value of everyone's money in a dozen years.

 The destruction of millions of acres of tropical jungles each year by peasant farmers and others is a problem for the developed nations as well as the Third World and requires economic and educational solutions, say scientists at a leading plant research institution. The Missouri Botanical Garden, known for its man-made tropical atmosphere in the so-called `` Climatron'' designed by <PERSON> Buckminster </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, is working to halt the decimation of the world's real tropical jungles. `` The outlook is pretty grim,'' said biologist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, director of the garden. `` Although tropical forests once covered at least 12 percent of the globe _ an area about twice the size of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ they have already been reduced to about half that.'' `` Currently, the forests are being cleared or degraded at the rate of about 60 million acres a year. That's an area about half the size of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said roughly half of all known plant and animal species on Earth are found in the tropical forests. At the current rate of destruction, as many as 60,000 species of plants will be extinct by the year 2020. `` The plant-rich tropics supply man with a wealth of food crops, medicines and other useful products,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Forero </PERSON>, director of research at the garden. `` But they are being destroyed rapidly.'' The chief culprits, <PERSON> Forero </PERSON> said, are loggers and slash-and-burn peasant farmers. The loggers obviously need the trees to stay in business and the farmers often have to destroy the forests to feed themselves and their families. And the scientists say the situation can only get worse unless something is done to stop it. `` At present, over half the people in the world live in countries that are at least partly tropical, excluding <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Forero </PERSON> said. `` Nearly a third of these people are already living in extreme poverty and with current rates of growth, the human population of these countries will double in less than 30 years.'' `` How can you tell these starving people that you are going to save the very things they have to destroy in order to sustain their already meager existence,'' asked <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>. `` Education and political and economic stability are obviously the keys. That and understanding.'' Which is why, <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said, the garden has committed itself to an all-out effort to explore, document and save the forests. With a staff of 70 researchers and technicians, including many who live permanently in the tropics, the garden makes up one of the world's largest active field research programs in tropical botany. The goals, the scientists said, are to collect the plant species before they become extinct and to teach the impoverished farmers how to live in the forest without destroying it. With the growing knowledge of genetics, they said, it is important that the genes, the biological blueprints, of the endangered species be saved. `` To lose this genetic capital through massive extinctions just as we are developing our capabilities to explore its potential would indeed be a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` The developments in genetics make the specter of extinction even worse,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` For each species of plant or animal lost to extinction, you're losing the potential for another 20,000 to 30,000 variants in the future. Many of the plants, scientists say, could almost certainly be developed into cheaper, easy-to-grow sources of highly nutritious food. Others could be converted into abundant sources of new medicines. Another important part of the garden's program is to lend technical assistance to and train scientists from developing tropical countries through cooperative agreements. `` Unfortunately, only 6 percent of the scientists working on the problem live in the countries involved,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` We must change that. Momentum to implement the innovative conservation and development strategies needed to deal with these urgent problems ultimately must come from the affected countries themselves,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. The backbone of the garden's research, the scientists said, is its herbarium, or plant collection. Along with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Botanical </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> herbarium is one of the three largest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and among the 12 largest in the world. Started by garden founder <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> in the 1850s, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> herbarium now contains samples of more than 3.5 million species and is expected to expand to 4.5 million within the next decade. Pointing to a large map showing the locations of the garden's researchers in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said of the encroachment on the forests: `` It wo n't be stopped soon `` But there are encouraging signs. What people have to learn is that conservation and development are really two sides of the same coin.'' `` Producers and consumers have to learn that they have a common problem. It can all be done, but it wo n't be easy.''

 <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> knows what it's like to huddle in bed with a baseball bat at hand, wondering how to protect her babies from rats scurrying across the rotting wooden floor of her tenement flat. She knows how to sidestep young men strung out on drugs huddled in dingy hallways, and she's no longer shocked by dead bodies _ even at her doorstep. `` You do n't get used to it,'' she said, `` but it's not a nightmare. If you see someone get shot or stabbed today _ usually you'd be nervous for days. It's not like that. ... It's just another one. You do n't lose any rest over that.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION>. A generation ago, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> lived here in a four-room flat. King had come north to wage war on poverty and inequality, but 20 years after his death, the slums and disparity remain. So do dreams of a better life. This poor <PERSON> black </PERSON> community he adopted has become even poorer _ and that, say those who knew him, would grieve King if he were alive today. `` If King were to look at <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> ... he'd think that his worst nightmare had come true,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> political science professor who did volunteer work with King. Some residents reluctantly agree. `` I think he was great enough to know and powerful enough to know his dream is not being fulfilled,'' said <PERSON> Cleodia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Quinn </PERSON>, who welcomed King to her home. `` He would know we have stepped backward.'' Black poverty is a bleak fact of life. Nearly one in three blacks _ 31.1 percent _ lived below the poverty line in 1986, compared with 11 percent of whites, according to federal statistics. And 20 years after the <ORGANIZATION> Kerner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> examined inner-city problems following the mid'60s riots and warned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was moving toward two societies, `` one black, one white _ separate and unequal,'' the gap remains. Life for inner-city blacks has worsened, scholars said in a follow-up study this year, partly because of industrial decline. Over 35 years, Rust Belt cities have lost almost half their manufacturing force, according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loic </PERSON> <PERSON> Wacquant </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the report said, lost half its manufacturing blue-collar workers from 1967-82. And that's taken its toll on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION>. The neighborhood's misery index is high. According to federal, city and state records: _ Four of ten people lived in poverty in 1980, an increase of a third over a decade earlier. _ More than a third of the housing is uninhabitable or so deteriorated it's beyond rehabilitation. _ Eight of 10 children are born out of wedlock. The 1986 infant mortality rate, 27.2 per 1,000 live births, was more than 2 -LCB- times the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average. _ Women headed 61 percent of the households in 1980. _ One in five people was out of work in 1980. Unemployment, some activists say, may now be as high as 30 percent. Much of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> has simply vanished. Since 1960, more than half the residents, thousands of jobs and most industries have fled. Gangs are more vicious, drugs more common. Still, optimists remain, proud, hard-working folks fighting to turn things around. `` We have been at the lowest of low,'' said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Lawndale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, an activist group. `` The citizens of this community are facing up to the problems.'' But reversing those fortunes is a formidable task. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> has block after block of weed-filled lots, gutted buildings and men in their prime who while away their days loitering on street corners or huddled around fires in garbage cans. `` You ca n't envision how it looked before,'' Mrs. <PERSON> O'Quinn </PERSON> said, shaking her head sadly. `` It's a wilderness now.'' Once a largely Jewish community with gray stone houses, stores, factories and banks, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> turned from white to mostly black in the 1950s. Absentee landlords and political neglect had contributed to its decline by 1966 when <PERSON> King </PERSON> moved into a $ 90-a-month, third-floor flat, with inadequate heat and halls reeking of urine. `` You ca n't really get close to the poor without living and being here with them,'' he said. King lived in the building, since torn down, on and off for several months that year. King tried to fight slumlords, build tenant unions, end discrimination. He led open-housing marches in all-white neighborhoods and tried to be peacemaker when riots flared in the summer of 1966. King, folks say, brought hope to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION>. His assassination brought destruction. Riots that tore apart <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities after <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s death in 1968 unleashed a storm of rage here as well _ the skies were ablaze, the streets filled with looters, blocks of businesses turned to rubble, houses to ashes and dreams to despair.

 `` The riots killed or ... almost mortally wounded the hope of the community,'' said <PERSON> Primus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mootry </PERSON>, executive vice president of the local <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was no <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> plan for this war-torn community. It was as if someone decided to let them sit there in the mess that they made and let them stew,'' he said. `` The consequences have been devastating. The community has been damned from the outside.'' Today, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> has 61,000 residents, less than half the population of almost 125,000 in 1965. Much of the middle-class has fled. `` If I had somewhere to go, I would have run, too,'' said 33-year resident <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. Tens of thousands of jobs also disappeared. Seventy-five percent of businesses were lost from 1960 to 1970. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- now <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- closed a plant <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> later moved its world headquarters out of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION>, keeping only a distribution and planning center. The main shopping strip, <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, remains a burned-out shell. A proposal by a national organization of planners, builders, bankers and others to build a $ 9.5 million shopping mall has been postponed. After 25 years of `` uninterrupted decline, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> resembles a war zone,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wacquant </PERSON> said in their study. Today, the neighborhood has some food and liquor stores. To buy anything else, `` you have to go an area you're not wanted to spend your money,'' said <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON>. `` It's insulting.'' Shopping, however, seems like a minor problem against the drug dealing, gangs and violence. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, for example, a 30-year-old with three teen-agers and a baby, has survived four apartments and 14 years of horror stories: she's fended off giant rats slurping out of her toilet, been forced out by an arsonist, witnessed a robbery, faced drug users shooting up in the hallway and seen murder victims, including a decapitated man. `` I've seen a lot of disaster,'' she said, adding that she carries a knife by day, a gun at night. `` We have a lot of lunatics out here.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> talks about returning to her native <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. In the meantime, she attends church with her children, visits their schools and preaches against drugs. `` They understand it,'' she said. `` They have seen it.'' Others have, too. Residents can rattle off the corners where drugs are sold like newspapers, customers pulling up in cars day and night. `` The only game left is the drug game,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, an unemployed counselor. `` To survive, to eat, to pay the rent. We do n't have a lot of jobs.'' Drug trafficking was n't always a problem, and the gangs of decades past directed their violence at each other. `` They did n't bother those of us doing good things,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> O'Quinn </PERSON>, who with her husband runs a drum and bugle corps for youths. ` The gangs do n't respect anything now.'' Mootry confirmed gangs are more lethal: zip guns, knives and chains have been replaced by <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> submachine guns and other sophisticated weapons. Yet the biggest problem, he said, may be a perception among youths that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> is `` an island ... a walled city -LRB- where -RRB- nothing comes in and nothing comes out. That is the way in which they are socialized. That's a great tragedy.'' <PERSON> Mootry </PERSON>'s organization tries to broaden horizons, offering recreational and education programs, including scholarships that have sent teens to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. Block clubs, slum-busting projects and infant health programs also have been started. `` Because people live in the ghetto, you do n't got to be dealing in dope, be a prostitute or on public aid,'' said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, the long-time <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> resident. `` You can live anywhere and be what you want to be.'' Some businesses have stayed afloat, too. The <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawndale </ORGANIZATION>, which opened in 1977 with $ 2 million in assets, now has $ 25 million. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, senior vice president, said investors still question the neighborhood's viability, despite its prime location and good transportation. A main reason is housing shortages. Only 727 units have been built since 1969, city officials say. Some federally subsidized housing has been built and almost $ 7 million has been spent to improve 5,000 units since 1983, they add. `` As long as you do n't have any housing, you're not going to have desirable residents,'' said resident <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>. `` This community is not going to be the way you'd like it to be anytime soon.'' Manning and others say a comeback depends on folks flexing political muscle. For years, `` we did n't demand nothing and we did n't get anything,'' he said. That, many say, changed with the 1983 election of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor who died last year and is regarded in the same revered tones as King. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who last Tuesday defeated the incumbent for the Democratic ward committeeman post, says <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION>'s problems may be the same as they were a generation ago, except for one difference: `` The political maturity is there now.'' `` <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> was and is a very poor community,'' he said. If King were alive, `` I think he'd be proud of the attitude of the residents. There's still hope. There are still efforts ... to bring <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> into the 20th century. I think we're very close.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wrote of his experiences in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> in his book `` Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or Community?'' It was published in 1967. Here are a few excerpts: `` The phone rings daily with countless stories of man's inhumanity to man, and I find myself struggling constantly against the depression and hopelessness which the hearts of our cities pump into the spiritual bloodstream of our lives.

 `` The children's clothes are too skimpy to protect them from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> wind, and a closer look reveals the mucus in the corners of their bright eyes, and you are reminded that vitamin pills and flu shots are luxuries which they can ill afford. The ` runny noses' of ghetto children become a graphic symbol of medical neglect in a society which has mastered most of the diseases from which they will too soon die. There is something wrong in a society that allows this to happen.''

 The ritual of the poor is conducted almost every day at the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters here. They walk in and sit quietly on battered chairs, their eyes scanning walls lined with photographs of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> marching along <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> roads. They wait, sometimes for hours, hoping for help to find a job, a home or a lost welfare check. `` They helped my sister last year when her lights was off, so I was thinking they would help me find another place to stay _ you know, a cheaper one,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who works at a fast-food restaurant and was waiting at the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> offices last week. But trying to meet such demands strains the financially strapped organization and its skeleton crew, which struggles both to treat the symptoms of poverty and find a cure for the disease. `` Oh, Lord, we get more requests than we can handle,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> president. `` We do what we can, but we just do n't have the staff to respond to all the cases.'' The poor bring complaints about everything from police brutality to housing and hiring practices, <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` The major incidents, for example, are the violence of minimum-wage jobs, or no jobs at all,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` The violence of homelessness. The violence of being the last hired and first fired. `` Most poor people are working; they simply do n't earn enough to get out of poverty.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> has tied itself to the needs of the needy since 1957, when it was founded by <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> and the Revs. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuttlesworth </PERSON> to expand the non-violent movement against legal segregation. Its eventual victory over discriminatory laws earned the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> a reputation of militancy that holds to this day. `` We are the activist arm of the movement. When you do that, you step on toes and you do n't become the most popular kid on the block,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` We know it's not as popular to give us support as it is some other groups that are not as controversial.'' The nation heard from the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> frequently last year as it spoke out on issues it felt could jeopardize human rights. It organized marches in virtually all-white <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; helped establish a biracial committee on race relations there; opposed Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>; condemned statements about blacks in sports made by <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> `` The Greek'' <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, and negotiated with major league groups to move blacks into upper management. `` We still believe in the efficacy of conscience-working and consciousness-raising and, if necessary, civil disobedience,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` We're going to have to continue to have advocacy groups to keep pressure on _ creative, non-violent pressure. We have to keep that alive.'' The group, which lacks solid corporate support, operates from a dingy brownstone in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s historic <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> district. The building has changed little since it was first occupied in 1962. `` This is <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s desk,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said, running his hand over the cluttered, chipped wooden desk in his office. `` We have not put thick carpets on the floor or lined the walls and ceilings with chandeliers because that's not where our priorities are.'' On April 4, the 20th anniversary of King's assassination, the group will kick off its 1988 Poor People's Crusade with hearings on homelessness and unemployment. It will also hold rallies, starting in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, then sweeping through <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> was ready to start a similar campaign when <PERSON> King </PERSON> was gunned down at a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> hotel in 1968. Days later, <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> members dried their tears and marched on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, carrying thousands of the nation's poor with them to dramatize poverty. This time around, the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> wants more than a display of what's gone wrong with efforts to wipe out poverty, <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said `` The crusade is trying to get poverty on the national agenda,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` Whoever comes into office -LRB- as president -RRB-, we want them to have a commitment to eliminating poverty and look at it as the urgent, critical problem that it is.'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said he hopes the campaign will change the recent tendency to celebrate the national King holiday in January with glitzy, ceremonial events that ignore the issues that dominated King's life. `` We're beginning to honor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> as a orator, as a dreamer, but we're not honoring the message,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said, glancing at a large photograph of him talking with King in a church pulpit. `` You've got people now who are paying honor to him on that holiday who are not doing anything about helping the poor or working for economic justice. `` They say, ` Dr. King this, Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> that,' then they do n't register to vote, they do n't join a boycott, they do n't work for peace and human dignity.

 Here are some statistics on black poverty and related issues: POVERTY: _ The national poverty rate for blacks in 1986 was 31.1 percent, compared with 11 percent for whites, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The poverty rate is based on those people whose income falls below a level determined by the federal government; the level is $ 8,737 for a three-person family, and $ 11,203 for a four-person family. _ In 1968, the year <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was assassinated, the black poverty rate was 34.7 percent, compared with 10 percent for whites. _ The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> had the highest proportion of blacks living below the poverty line, 34.5 percent, in 1986, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a series of reports published by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 UNEMPLOYMENT: _ The black unemployment rate in 1987 was 13 percent, 2 -LCB- times the 5.3 percent for whites, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. _ In 1968, before statistics were broken down for specific racial or ethnic groups, all minority unemployment was 6.7 percent. The white jobless rate was 3.2 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 INCOME: _ Median family income for blacks has increased every year since the recession-fueled low point of 1982, the Urban League said. However, the average median black family income throughout the 1980s is $ 16,476, compared with $ 17,765 for the 1970s. _ In a single year, 1986, median black family income was $ 17,604, compared with $ 30,809 for whites. _ In 1986, 44.2 percent of black families had incomes of less than $ 10,000, compared with 13.7 percent of white families.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 CHILDREN: _ In 1986, 42.7 percent of all black children under 18 years of age were officially classified as poor. The comparable figure for white children was 15.3.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 CITIES: _ From 1970 to 1980, the number of people living below the poverty line in the cores of the nation's 10 largest cities increased by 19 percent, from 3.1 million to 3.8 million, according to a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> study by <PERSON> Loic </PERSON> <PERSON> Wacquant </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The increase, the study said, was due entirely to increased poverty among minorities. The cities measured were the largest as of 1970 _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. _ In the 1970-80 decade, the number of poor people rose 30 percent in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 24 percent in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 20 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 16 percent in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the study said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This may be a sleep time for great agricultural crusades in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, at least until after the November elections. A widely reported financial recovery in the farm sector, new credit legislation, rising agricultural exports, and the approaching busy time of another spring have dulled the swords of challenge. One of the last hints of battle on behalf of producers was put aside 10 days ago by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., who announced he had no further plans to seek changes in the current soybean program There was simply `` a lack of consensus'' on how to proceed on a proposed marketing loan program for soybeans, <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in fact, had asked that no changes be made. But an attempt was made last week to include a `` triggered'' marketing loan program in the thousand-page trade bill being negotiated by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees. Marketing loans, already in effect for some commodities, provide crop support at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price levels, allowing farmers to repay the loans at world prices, with taxpayers making up the difference. The marketing loan approach would be triggered for wheat, corn and soybeans if trade negotiations fail to reduce world agricultural subsidies by 1990. Administration officials have indicated President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might veto the trade bill if such a measure is included. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in December passed landmark legislation on farm credit, providing some financial relief to thousands of sorely pressed families. And a $ 76 billion budget-cutting package included reductions and other adjustments in farm program loan rates and target prices through the 1990 crops. Thus, except for the possibility of changes in the sugar program or sudden tinkering with dairy, the remainder of 1988 may be a legislative yawner for farm folk. But in 1989 _ with a new administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ the debate will begin again, this time on 1990 legislation to amend, replace or extend the current Food Security Act of 1985. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's philosophy for more than seven years has been in support of `` market-oriented'' agricultural policy, which the 1985 law, within specific limits, has allowed. The reduction in crop price support rates, a lowering of milk supports, and other adjustments are examples of the flexibility permitted in the current law. Critics have proposed more of a `` supply management'' texture to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm policy, some advocating the direct role of farmers in determining how far to go. The 1990 farm bill debate will pit old adversaries, or at least their ideas, some of which have long outlived their progenitors. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON>, professor emeritus at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was a young farmer with his father and brother at the beginning of the Great Depression, when farm commodity prices dropped 56 percent from 1929 to 1932, and land values plummeted by more than half. <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> much later held posts in the administrations of three <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> presidents: <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. He has been recognized for decades as one of the nation's foremost agricultural economists and farm policy experts. Last fall <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> wrote an article for <ORGANIZATION> IMPRIMIS </ORGANIZATION>, the monthly journal of <ORGANIZATION> Hillsdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hillsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, in which he recounted those early Depression years on the northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farm. He described the differing schools of economic thought that prevailed at the time. One school was led by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who thought the farm problem was general, resulting from the collapse of money and credit. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> thought the remedy lay in revised monetary policy. <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> agreed. The other school, led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, held that agriculture itself was to blame because of surplus production. The remedy consisted of reducing supplies so that prices would improve. As it happened, the New Deal farm program was built upon the latter philosophy and was a `` major change in the farm policy agenda,'' <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> said. For 70 years prior to the onset of New Deal of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s administration in 1933, there had been a `` historic agenda based on increased production, individual farmer decision and competitive markets,'' he said. <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> said the key words for the new farm policy were relief, recovery and reform. `` I recall well the revival of hope on the farm front that accompanied passage of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> farm programs,'' he wrote. `` Farmers were given a role in working out their own chosen solutions to their problems. They were put on committees by the thousands. They elected officers, attended meetings and spoke their minds.'' <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> added: `` Government checks began to flow. The hemorrhage of farm foreclosures began to abate. On every hand was evidence that the government cared. The Great Depression dragged on, but the mood changed for the better on American farms.'' But recovery was only partial seven years after passage of the initial New Deal programs. Complete agricultural recovery from the depression of the 1930s `` must ge credited more to the stimulus of -LRB- World War II -RRB- than to management of supply and price,'' he said. Important traits of the New Deal programs persisted beyond their usefulness, <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> said. `` Reform was, for the greater part, aborted,'' he said. `` The agricultural elite, generally the large landowners, managed to retain most of the program benefits themselves rather than share them with tenants or employees. The modern <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, for example, is a descendant of the <ORGANIZATION> Resettlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, agencies created to bring relief to impoverished farmers. But the FmHA today `` has been co-opted by the agricultural establishment,'' <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> said. `` The New Deal farm programs, intended to lift average farm income, actually widened the income gap between the top and bottom economic groups,'' he said. `` Relief was achieved, recovery occurred for other reasons, and reform miscarried.'' In their modern form, government farm programs can not be called New Deal programs because `` they have been adopted by most of the Republican farm politicians,'' <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> said. `` As an observer, I can no longer find credible differences in the Congress between the farm policies of the two major parties,'' he said. Yet, when programs persist so long, it can be virtually impossible to root them out or even change them substantially. `` If the programs are to be cut back and reformed, the effort will have to be applied from outside the farm sector,'' <PERSON> Paarlberg </PERSON> said. `` The farm lobby will never discipline itself.''

The number of shares tendered to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which represents less than 4 percent of the company's goal, indicates shareholders might be waiting to see what will happen next in the battle for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. The focus of attention was federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> was considering the validity of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' shareholders rights plan and the expiration date of the Campeau bid. During a hearing late Monday, <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> asked Sand to delay expiration of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer by 20 days to lessen the pressure on <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shareholders to accept the hostile bid. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> contended the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> offer, which was amended from an earlier proposal, actually was a new offer and under federal law would have to remain open past its planned Friday expiration. Sand was seeking an opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Macy argument and said he would not rule before today. Sand also was considering <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge to the poison pill, which <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board approved in January before <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> made its hostile bid and after developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> indicated interest in the nation's fifth-largest retailer. The plan allows current <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shareholders to buy more of the company's stock at a steep discount during a hostile takeover, making a takeover prohibitively expensive. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> says its bid can not proceed while the poison pill is in effect. Sand said both buyout offers would have to remain open at least three business days after he ruled on the poison pill, meaning <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer must now remain open into next week. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its merger agreement with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> by $ 200 million in cash to a total of $ 6.3 billion. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> is offering $ 77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million Federated shares, up from its original $ 74.50 per share. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> will exchange shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities for the remainder of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.5 million outstanding shares. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 75 in cash per share for 70.5 million Federated shares. The remaining of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock would be acquired later for $ 44 cash per share in a subsequent merger, giving the deal an aggregate value of $ 68 per share or a total of $ 6.18 billion. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> announced its fourth-quarter earnings. The company said its net income rose nearly 10 percent to $ 176.97 million, or $ 2 per share, up from $ 1.71.3 million, or $ 1.82 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales for the quarter, which ended Jan. 31, totaled $ 3.55 billion, up from $ 3.44 billion. For all of fiscal 1987, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said it earned $ 313 million, or $ 3.40 per share, up 14 percent from $ 287.6 million, or $ 2.97 per share, in 1986.

 Late mortgage payments and mortgage foreclosures increased in the last quarter of 1987, with delinquent payments rising for the first time in two years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The lenders trade group reported Tuesday that the number of homeowners who were at least 30 days late in making a mortgage payment edged up to 4.99 percent of the 10 million mortgages surveyed in the fourth quarter. This compared to 4.63 percent in the July-September quarter, which had been the lowest level in more than eight years. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the association, called the increase `` disappointing but not disheartening,'' noting that the increase reflected continued weakness in depressed areas of the country such as the oil-producing states of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Foreclosures also rose to 0.27 percent of mortgages, up from 0.25 percent in the third quarter, with much of the increase coming in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the South. The increase in late mortgage payments was the first rise since the fourth quarter of 1985, when the delinquency rate climbed to 5.75 percent. Even with the increase late last year, all regions of the country reported lower deliquency rates when compared to a year earlier. The West had the fewest delinquent mortgages in the final three months of last year at 4.6 percent, followed by the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> at 4.76 percent and the North Central states at 5.96 percent. The South had the highest delinquency rate in the fourth quarter with 6.07 percent of mortgage-holders at least 30 days late with a payment.

 Car and truck shoppers who expected <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s buyer incentives to expire at the end of February hastened their <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> purchases, weakening the industry-leader's sales in early March, industry analysts say. But early March brought generous surges in domestic car and light truck sales for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s top rivals, as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> joined the incentives battle that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has waged all year. Automakers reported Tuesday that total sales of domestic-built cars and light trucks rose 6.3 percent in early March from a year ago. Sales reached 328,437 in the nine selling days from March 1-10, compared with the 274,626 sold in the eight selling days of the same period last year. The percentage change in sales measures the difference in average daily sales during the two periods, not the difference in total numbers of vehicles sold. Sales have improved in each of the seven sales periods of 1988 over early 1987, when showrooms were empty because of the late 1986 buying rush to beat impending tax law changes. In early March, automakers sold 211,772 domestic cars, up 3.5 percent from 181,820, and 116,665 light trucks, up 11.7 percent from 92,806 a year ago. Despite last-minute extensions of its buyer incentives, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales fell 13 percent from a year ago and its light truck sales slowed 1.5 percent from early March 1987 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales fell to 95,372 from 97,487 a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales fell slightly to 42,489, or 4,721 a day, from 38,327, or 4,790 a day. `` A lot of people rushed to buy -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- cars in early February, so we had a kind of pay-back effect in early March,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> dealers also had pushed sales particularly hard in late February, fearing a buildup of unsold car inventories that would be hard to move in March without incentives, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the domestic car market slipped in early March to 45 percent from 53.6 percent a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s truck market share fell to 36.4 percent from 41.3 percent. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> boosted its early March sales by sweetening its incentive program, the analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its combined domestic car and light truck sales were its highest for early March since 1979. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales jumped 21.4 percent to 68,859 in early March from 50,407 a year ago and its market share rose to 32.5 percent from 27.7 percent. Its light truck sales rose 18.1 percent to 46,073 in early March from 34,685 a year ago as its market slice improved to 39.5 percent from 37.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic-built car sales rose 18.3 percent to 34,667 from 26,046 a year ago. Its light truck sales jumped 24.1 percent, to 25,287 from 18,108 a year ago. The No. 3 automaker's share of the domestic car market rose to 16.4 percent from 14.3 percent a year ago and its truck share increased to 21.7 percent from 19.5 percent. Among the remaining domestic builders, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 71.9 percent jump in sales of cars built at its <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, factory. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales rose 97.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales fell 19.7 percent from a year ago but its domestic truck sales rose 48.5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s domestic car sales dropped 18.6 percent.

<HEAD>First City Grants Second Extension To Debt Holders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> again has extended its deadline to dissident debt holders who have been asked to redeem their securities at a discount under a federal bailout plan for the institution. Only about 51 percent of the holders of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> notes totaling $ 225.9 million had tendered their securities as of lare Tuesday afternoon. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' fourth-largest bank holding company had sought 90 percent of those securities, which were to be redeemed at less than face value as part of a buyout plan contained in a $ 1.5 billion bailout led by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. If completed, it would be the second-biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank rescue ever. The low response prompted <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> to extend Tuesday's 5 p.m. EST deadline to March 29. It was the second extension given by the Houston-based company _ the first being last week after only 41.4 percent, or $ 93.6 million, of the notes had been redeemed for cash. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, who would become chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> under the bailout plan, said actions were being taken to complete the transaction by alternate means but did not elaborate. Under a buyout plan that was made a condition of the federal bailout, holders of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s debt securities wre offered from 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar for their notes. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, who said debt holders would fare worse if the bank were liquidated, told federal regulators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last weekend that not enough of the note holders had agreed to sell at those prices. He also has contended there was no intention to raise the amount of the offer. However, some industry analysts have indicated that some debt holders who do n't tender their notes might end up getting a better deal once <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> is recapitalized. Depending on the strength of the recapitalized institution, the bonds could trade at significantly higher prices than <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> is offering. Still other analysts have said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> could refuse to raise the offer for fear of setting a precedent for future bank bailouts. Some of the alternatives being discussed for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> included dropping the participation threshold below 90 percent or terminating the tender offer. Other options available to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said, include canceling the <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> deal and reopening bidding for the bank, or having the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> itself take over <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> did just that in 1984, pumping $ 4.5 billion into <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> during the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank bailout ever. Another plan calls for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s 59 banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to fail and merge into a `` bridge bank'' until a new buyer is found. Still another option is for the holding company, with $ 11 billion in assets, to enter voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. First City grew quickly during the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil boom, but was hammered by energy and real estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $ 1.1 billion loss. The bailout plan calls for $ 970 million in federal assistance, a $ 500 million infusion of capital raised privately by an investor group headed by <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> and a spinoff of $ 1.79 billion in book value of poorly performing assets. On March 4, more than 71 percent of the bank holding company's 37 million shareholders approved the controversial bailout

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, angry over European subsidies for the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> aircraft-manufacturing consortium, is increasing pressure on Airbus nations to abolish or at least reduce the payments, say diplomatic sources. `` The Americans at a minimum want the Europeans to give a signal that they are willing to accept some effective discipline in regard to subsidies,'' an informed diplomatic source, who asked not to be identified further, said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> estimates that the four countries involved in <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ have pumped $ 10 billion into the consortium since it was created 17 years ago. Ministers of the four Airbus countries are to meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials in the southern West German resort city of <LOCATION> Constance </LOCATION> on Friday to continue discussions on the dispute. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s external relations commissioner, said last week that there was a `` realistic chance'' of settling the dispute, but said <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> governments could not entirely renounce state aid payments to Airbus. He predicted an agreement would require `` further rounds of very difficult negotiations.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains that subsidies to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> are unfair to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft makers in the wide-body, long-haul passenger jet market. The Airbus nations contend the subsidies do not distort trade and are allowed under the civil aircraft provisions of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> also contends <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft manufacturers long have enjoyed huge, indirect subsidies through military contracts from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and millions in government research grants. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has threatened to retaliate against <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> if the negotiations fail, despite a recent decision by the four <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> ministers to have <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> managers enter into direct negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on a possible joint project. The aim of the talks is to see whether the two sides could collaborate on one or more new airplanes. Under the prosposal, the new aircraft would not compete with existing models. But diplomatic sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the move was unlikely to reduce tensions over the subsidy issue. `` It may well be helpful for <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> to agree on a joint project, but that will not solve the core problem of the current subsidies,'' said another diplomatic source, who also declined to be identified further. A spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declined comment on the upcoming meeting. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is expected to attend the talks.

Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The announcement Tuesday that weekend office hours will end next year for the nation's Postal Savings System could mean an effective move to a five-day work week. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Posts and Telecommunications Minister, a top banking official and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> all indicated separately on Tuesday that they favored moving toward a nationwide five-day work week beginning February 1989. Such moves by the concerned parties would eliminate Saturday business hours for the Postal Savings System, banks and stock trading. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s banks and stock market currently only close on the second and third Saturdays of each month, while keeping half-day hours for the remaining Saturdays. A six-day work week still is routine for many Japanese. The proposal is designed to promote a less workaholic and a more leisure-based society commensurate with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s higher standard of living. Such a trend, proponents argue, could indirectly stimulate domestic demand by increasing personal consumption and the growth of service and other non-export industries. The movement toward a five-day work week has drawn increased support from financial and government groups for the past several years. Posts and Telecommunications Minister <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> touched off a flurry of comments Tuesday by announcing he had decided to terminate weekend office hours for the Postal Savings System beginning next February. The ministry oversees the system _ one of the largest savings networks in the world _ where cash deposits have been declining due to higher interest rates on other investment instruments. In response to <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON> Kenichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamiya </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION>' Associations of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said, `` It is important for all large participants to be in agreement.'' A federation spokesman said <PERSON> Kamiya </PERSON>'s comments, made at a separate press conference, meant to suggest major banks and securities houses would be willing to fall in line with the savings ministry's move. In another separate comment, <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said he favored the five-day work week in the wake of <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>'s decision. <PERSON> Kamiya </PERSON>, who also is president of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, added the banking federation, which represents the interests of major Japanese banking institutions, has been working on the concept of creating a five-day work week since November of last year. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s banking industry had hoped to shift toward the five-day week as early as October 1988, but postponed its action until early 1989 in order to overlap with the anticipated weekend closing of government postal savings offices, industry sources said.

 E.W. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the privately held parent corporation of the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, says it plans to sell some of its limited-voting common stock to the public. The newspaper publishing company said Tuesday that the number of shares to be sold had not been determined but that control of the company would remain with the founding Scripps family. It said the required paperwork was expected to be filed with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> next month. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leser </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said the stock sale was intended to pay off debt incurred for the company's acquisition program begun in 1986 and to finance further growth. <PERSON> Leser </PERSON> said it also would provide liquidity for members of the Scripps family who will control the company after the termination of the <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, the present controlling shareholder. The trust is to terminate upon the death of the last of the four eldest children of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scripps </PERSON>, son of company founder E.W. Scripps. At termination, the assets of the trust are to be distributed to 28 great-grandchildren of E.W. Scripps. During its existence, the trust is required to maintain voting control of E.W. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The company has an 80 percent-owned subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has public ownership and is traded over-the-counter. The stock sale will not affect the status of that company, the announcement said. E.W. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns 21 daily newspapers, nine television stations, five radio stations and cable systems nationwide that serve approximately 400,000 cable TV subscribers. It also owns <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based syndicator of newspaper columns and comic strips. E.W. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was reincorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> in 1987 and has two classes of common stock outstanding: regular common and Class A common, which has limited voting power. The capital structure is similar to that of other media companies that seek to retain control within the founding family, <PERSON> Leser </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> now owns 73 percent of the regular common shares and 90 percent of the Class A shares. Holders of the Class A common shares to be sold to the public will be entitled to elect a third of the company directors, but will not have other voting rights. In all other respects, the Class A stock is comparable to the regular common shares, the company said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scripps </PERSON>, board chairman of the E.W. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the trustees of the trust, said: `` My grandfather, through the trust, perpetuated family control for as long as was legally possible. The present capitalization, with a public market for the Class A common shares, will permit the next generation of the family to retain control of the company after the termination of the trust and provide liquidity for their holdings.'' The majority of the shares to be offered will be newly issued stock. The trust will sell a portion of its holding, but it will continue to hold a majority of both the regular common and Class A shares after the sale.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to seek federal assistance comes as the nation's 13th-largest banking company tries to bolster the waning confidence of its depositors and the financial markets. First RepublicBank indicated Tuesday it was seeking federal aid to keep from failing, and had held preliminary discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We seek some assistance, yet to be defined. We will be putting together, over the next few weeks, a plan that we can submit to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> for assistance,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` It was important that we initiate those discussions in order to provide a more stable environment for our company,'' he said. Shaken by the slumping real estate and energy sectors and a loss of confidence in the institution by Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> suffered a loss of about $ 600 million in deposits over a five-day period last month, prompting the decision to seek federal help. `` Certainly two or three weeks ago we did n't believe this would be necessary,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company. First RepublicBank officials tried last month to combat rumors that the bank was considering merging with another financial institution, taking the unusual step of buying full-page newspaper ads to assure customers their deposits were safe. <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said he did n't believe the latest development would lead more depositors to withdraw their money because `` we expect our customers will understand that their money is protected.'' First RepublicBank is discussing whether to pursue open-bank assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, generally used only if the agency finds keeping a bank open would be less costly to the government than letting it fail. An <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> bailout of that kind would require regulators to determine that the bank would fail without help. Disclosure of the talks with the government _ and the company's suspension of payment of preferred stock dividends _ were greeted with pessimism by Wall Street First RepublicBank's stock fell 25 cents to $ 1.50 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> _ a 14.3 percent drop. Furthermore, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> downgraded <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>'s senior debt rating to its lowest level short of default. The Wall Street credit rating form also downgraded the bank holding company's certificate of deposit and commercial paper ratings. Fronterhouse contended the company would continue to thrive and remain an important institution in the state for years. But financial analysts said the request for federal aid could foretell a buyout or merger for First RepublicBank, which was created by the merger of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> rivals <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. `` The real estate market turned down, I think, much more rapidly than the bank had thought and it just turned into a snowball effect,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> independent bank consultant. `` And they got into a situation where news was being leaked from meetings of some of their top-level officials to various news media. `` And whereas that did not cause the problem, it surely exacerbated the problem,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 656 million in 1987, mainly because a staggering 17 percent of its $ 15 billion loan portfolio was either past due or renegotiated. Reports indicate the holding company stands to lose another $ 450 million this year. The company has 73 affiliate banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and assets of $ 33.2 billion, and employs 15,188 people. Separately, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> extended a Tuesday deadline for debt holders to redeem their securities at a discount under a rescue plan representing the second-largest bank bailout in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. First City granted a second extension, to 5 p.m. EST March 29, after the required 90 percent of debt holders failed to tender their the securities. Some industry analysts contended that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to seek federal aid could help <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking `` It should lend further stability to the banking system in the state,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannigan </PERSON>, an analyst and vice president of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There has been a great deal of negative press, and the fact that they are seeking some kind of <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance should create some additional confidence in the system.''

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover President In Suprise Resignation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s surprise resignation as president of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> comes as the bank holding company is on the verge of an expected rebound from recent financial setbacks. <PERSON> Torell </PERSON> resigned `` at his initiative'' to pursue other business opportunities, according to spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON>. The resignation is effective at the end of this month. `` The board accepted it with deepest regret,'' <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said. Recent speculation on Wall Street about a possible management shakeup at the bank had focused not on <PERSON> Torell </PERSON> but on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, according to analysts. In his most recent position, <PERSON> Torell </PERSON> was the company's No. 2 executive behind <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON> and widely was considered his heir apparent. Analysts have said <PERSON> Torell </PERSON> played a key role in helping the banking company emerge from its recent earnings problems and was largely responsible for developing its successful consumer finance business. In its annual report released earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> said it expected a profit of at least $ 807 million this year. Like other big money-center banks, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> established a huge loan-loss reserve to cover shaky foreign debts in 1987, which was largely responsible for a $ 1.14 billion loss that year. <PERSON> Torell </PERSON>, 48, said in a news release from the bank that after a 27-year career at Manufacturers Hanover, including 10 years as a director, `` it is time for a change.'' <PERSON> Torell </PERSON> joined the bank fresh from graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He became vice chairman in 1978, president of the bank in 1982 and president of the holding company in 1985, <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said. Manufacturers Hanover is the nation's sixth largest bank holding company with assets totaling $ 73.3 billion. A search committee of the board will be convened to choose a successor for <PERSON> Torell </PERSON>. Candidates from inside and outside the institution will be considered, according to <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> says it is retreating from a policy that denied credit cards to some university students because they majored in humanities, after receiving complaints from around the country. In the latest fallout from the policy, students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> who said they were denied cards because of their humanities majors called for the bank to change the policy or get its representatives off campus. `` It does n't take people from college to see that their reasoning that a humanities major is more of a financial risk than an engineering major is pretty weak,'' said student <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yip </PERSON>, 22. <PERSON> Yip </PERSON> _ a rhetoric major _ received a Visa last year while attending a different college as a mathematics major. <PERSON> Yip </PERSON>'s rejection letter for a <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> dated Feb. 13 listed `` field of study'' as the cause Other liberal arts majors who say <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> rejected their credit applications include some studying Italian and history. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the bank was `` moving away'' from the policy, which would be discontinued by the end of June. He admitted the company had received complaints from students at other universities around the country but he would not identify the schools. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, in an interview Tuesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, would not describe how the policy was applied. Some students with humanities majors at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> reported they had received <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> credit cards. Furthermore, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Comptroller of the Currency in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. said Tuesday that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act does not prohibit using a student's academic major in a credit application system. Nevertheless, some of the students turned down for credit at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> are seeking to have <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> denied access to the campus, where its representatives set up tables around the student union to accept credit applications. The humanities policy surfaced last week when <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, a reporter for the independent campus newspaper, The Daily Californian, asked a campus bank-card canvasser how to apply. `` I told her I had heard a rumor that English majors were being turned down, and she said I should give her a student photo identification instead of my registration card, which lists my major,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said Tuesday in an interview. `` She then told me to fill in the application by putting in business administration or electrical engineering as my major, instead of English, which she said was what students -LRB- at another university -RRB- were doing,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Denn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> student body president, said he does n't want to threaten <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> but believes student government's right to regulate groups at the student union building gives him `` leverage to suggest a policy change.'' <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, 22, an art history major rejected last fall for a Visa from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> because of her major, says she supports punitive action against <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's obvious discrimination, and I do n't think they should be allowed to get away with thinking that some majors are the ones that are going to be making all the money,'' she said. `` What I study says nothing about my responsibility or whether or not I can pay my bills,'' said <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, who graduated in December and now works in retail sales.

 Aggregate overseas equity investment by South Korean companies since 1962 totaled $ 1 billion as of the end of February, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Ministry officials said it was the first time the cumulative tally topped the $ 1 billion mark since 1962 Korean companies began investing abroad in 1962. They said about one-third of the total went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for manufacturing and other projects. Officials also said Korean investment abroad had shown marked rises in the past two years, reflecting the country's growing current account surplus, with $ 157 million invested in 1986 and $ 397 million in 1987. Ministry statistics indicated foreign equity investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since 1962 was a cumulative $ 3.92 billion as of the end of January, after deducting withdrawals over the period.

 The dollar gained ground against all major foreign currencies except the Canadian dollar in thin European trading early today despite some profit-taking. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign currency dealers said market attention was focused on Thursday's scheduled release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for January. Analysts are divided on whether the figures will show an expanding or shrinking trade deficit. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to 127.49. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 127.40 yen. `` The yen is easing against the dollar ... but everyone is waiting for the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade data,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. A trader with a major Italian commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said his bank was predicting a January shortfall of $ 13.5 billion, wider than $ 12.2 billion in December. But he said `` it should n't hurt the dollar too much. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6683 West German marks, up from 1.6650; 1.3802 Swiss francs, up from 1.3760; 5.6770 French francs, up from 5.6605; 1.8734 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8705; 1,237.50 Italian lire, up from 1,232.40; and 1.2540 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2564 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8505, cheaper for buyers than late Tuesday's $ 1.8570.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was poised today to veto a major piece of civil rights legislation and call for an alternative giving corporations and religious schools more exemptions from anti-discrimination laws. A top civil rights leader said the veto would leave `` a terrible and lasting stain on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency'' and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would quickly override the president's action Today was the deadline for action on the sweeping measure, designed to overcome the effects of a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that has allowed institutions to receive federal aid even when some of their departments discriminate illegally. The bill would require all parts of any institution receiving federal aid to obey anti-discrimination laws. `` We have said all along we would veto,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president believes the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision, which involved <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, was a mistake but that the corrective legislation goes too far in seeking to correct the problem The bill became an issue in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> presidential primary when Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to say whether he would veto or sign the legislation if he were president. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration has `` a very positive alternative bill'' but he declined to give details. An administration official, however, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the alternative was expected to be `` very much like'' a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> substitute that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected by a 266-146 vote on March 2. That measure would have scaled back the bill's impact on corporations and allowed more schools to avoid compliance with civil rights laws on religious grounds. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans that he objected to the bill that eventually passed because it `` dramatically expands the scope of federal jurisdiction over state and local governments and the private sector'' and `` poses a particular threat to religious liberty.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill 75-14 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed it 315-98, margins substantially greater than the two-thirds majority of both houses needed to override a presidential veto. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said Tuesday that he expected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto later this week and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to follow suit next week <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the 200-group <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said that by vetoing the bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be `` favoring federal subsidies to discrimination.'' `` A presidential veto of a bill to end federal funding of discrimination would be unconscionable,'' he said. `` It will leave a terrible and lasting stain on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency.'' The administration official who spoke anonymously said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> strategy would be to try to get <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who voted for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> substitute to vote to sustain the veto. Since 146 _ the number of legislators who supported the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> substitute _ is slightly more than one-third of the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> membership of 435, that could be enough to sustain. The civil rights bill would require entire colleges, school systems, government agencies and private entities to comply with anti-discrimination laws if any program or activity within them receives federal money. Institutions that did not comply would lose their federal funding. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> decision limited the penalty to the specific program or activity that violated the law.

<TEXT>
 Stock prices fell Wednesday amid concerns about British monetary policy following Tuesday's fiscal 1989 budget announcement. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks was down 9 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,830.9 at midday. Volume was a moderate 314.1 million shares, compared with 241.3 million shares the same time Tuesday. Concerns focused on the strength of the pound and perceptions that the next move in British interest rates likely would be higher. The pound's recent rise has spurred worries about lower corporate profitability. The budget announcement did little to dispel these fears, dealers said. Also hitting share prices was profit-taking following strong gains posted in the run-up to the budget announcement, dealers said. They added that prices were being marked down amid light volume as the market awaits Thursday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for January. `` With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures tomorrow, I do n't think I'd be an aggressive buyer either,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, an equities strategist at <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Capel </PERSON> and Co.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has boosted buyer incentives on six models, offering as much as $ 1,500 in rebates, and one analyst said a `` fire sale'' seemed to be under way at the No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was raising rebates on five 1987 and 1988 Dodge cars and trucks and one Jeep model. The incentive program has no expiration date. The automaker also said it planned to reduce rebates on three other models after the weekend. Analysts credit the aggressive use of incentives with spurring sales. In early March, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales were up 18.3 percent and its light truck sales were up 24.1 percent from a year ago. `` Chrysler has the most generous incentives of any automaker. It's really running a fire sale on its left-over' 87s,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Rebates rose to $ 1,500 from $ 750 on the <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacifica </LOCATION>; to $ 1,000 from $ 750 on <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION> Z and standard Ram pickups; to $ 1,000 from $ 500 on standard Ram B150, B250 and B350 passenger vans; and to $ 750 from $ 500 on <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> mid-size pickups and Jeep Comanche pickup. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it also added its 1987 and 1988 Chrysler LeBaron convertible to the program with a $ 750 rebate. On Monday, rebates on three other models will be reduced. The rebate on the 1987 and 1988 LeBaron coupe will drop to $ 750 from $ 1,500; to $ 1,000 from $ 1,500 on the Dodge Ramcharger sport-utility vehicle; and to $ 500 from $ 750 on the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highline </ORGANIZATION>. Instead of rebates, buyers can opt for low-rate financing with interest rates of 3.8 percent on loans up to 48 months and 8.8 percent on loans up to 60 months, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> division said it was extending its $ 500 rebate campaign through the end of the month on 1987 and 1988 S-15 compact pickups and sport-utility vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also added its new 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> full-size pickup and 1987 and 1988 Rally passenger vans and <PERSON> Vandura </PERSON> cargo vans to the program, also with $ 500 rebates. The rebates may be used in addition to continuous option discounts. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sales fell in early March because buyers took advantage of widespread incentives in February.

<TEXT>
 The publisher of a Canadian computer magazine says he was trying to show the dangers of software piracy when he wrote a rogue computer program that has popped up in software developed by <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But to <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> and others, the so-called computer `` virus'' _ apparently the first to appear in commercial software _ has caused consternation. Viruses are programs created by computer operators for secret insertion into other programs as jokes or as acts of vandalism. They can spread from computer to computer when operators share contaminated software. Consequences of the `` disease'' can range from a surprise message that pops up on a computer screen, as happened with the Aldus virus, to the destruction of information stored in computer memories. Until now, personal computer viruses were thought to reside only in non-commercial software, such as that available free or at low cost on computerized bulletin boards or on software disks shared by computer users. Experts had thought viruses could be avoided if users used only commercial, off-the-shelf programs. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON>, publisher of Montreal-based MacMag, acknowledged Tuesday in an interview that he wrote the so-called `` peace message'' that popped up on thousands of Apple Macintosh computer screens. <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> claimed that besides calling for world peace, the virus was intended to discourage software piracy or unauthorized copying and to encourage computer users to buy original copies. The virus was discovered in FreeHand, a new program developed by <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> for Macintosh computers, said <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laury </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. The message flashed when the program was loaded in the computer, Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. Although it `` was a very benign incident,'' <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> officials are angry and `` are talking with our attorneys to understand what our legal rights are in this instance,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` We feel that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON>'s actions deserve to be condemned by every member of the Macintosh community,'' she said. The incident resulted in Aldus having to recall or rework thousands of packages of the new software. Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> declined to say how much the recall or reworking of software would cost. The incident also sent a scare through the computer industry, because several of the nation's largest software companies also are clients of a <ORGANIZATION> MacroMind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a subcontractor that inadvertently spread the virus to <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION>. MacroMind President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday that he believed <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> was the only customer that received the virus.

Unaware of the infection, <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> ran the progam once and when he used the same computer to work on <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> software, the disk eventually sent to <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> became infected, he said. The computer virus then inadvertently was copied onto disks sold to customers and infected their computers, he said. <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Canter </PERSON>, but denied giving him software. <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> said the virus program was written and tested for a year on a number of Macintosh computers, and was left for two days in December on a Macintosh at the magazine's offices. The publisher said he had expected that people making unauthorized copies of programs on the machine would spread the virus in the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> area and possibly a few other areas of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> said, an estimated 350,000 people in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had the message pop up on their computers on March 2. <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> said neither he nor his employees put the message on a computer billboard or information network, but he did not rule out the possibility that others who copied it without permission placed programs containing the message on such services. Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON> both said the virus died out after March 2. The full message, according to <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON>, read: `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandow </PERSON>, the publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff would like to take this opportunity to convey their universal message of peace to all Macintosh users around the world.'' Beneath that was a graphic of the globe.

<HEAD>Northwest Eases Advance Purchase Requirement on Some Discount
Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has lowered the advance purchase requirement, to three days, on a discount fare used by business travelers. The change took effect Tuesday as major airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, raised full coach fares and ended some discount fares, sharply increasing the cost of travel for people who can not make plans in advance. Northwest's change, which its competitors are expected to match, will make it easier for travelers to take advantage of some discount fares. The fare, available on a limited number of seats on most routes, carries no cancellation penalty and has no other restrictions. Under the changes that took effect Tuesday, most discount fares generally require a seven-day advance purchase and carry a cancellation penalty of 25 percent. If other airlines match the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> fare, it would be the first modification of a series of fare increases proposed this month by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and matched by all leading carriers. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>, vice president for public relations at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, said the airline was joining its competitors in extending to seven days from two the advance purchase requirement on Maxsaver fares, the lowest fares available. In addition, <PERSON> Wren </PERSON> said some carriers were proposing a 14-day advance purchase requirement, but that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> did not support the idea.

 The stock market showed a small gain today, continuing the sluggish pattern of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .83 to 2,048.24 in the first half hour. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 468 up, 446 down and 578 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 19.47 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade balance for January. Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those expectations, analysts believe the market would n't feel any great shock effects. But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either way. After the trade report, the market is also faced with a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock index options and futures that will be settled Friday. That too may pass quietly, brokers say, but until it is over it adds an additional element of uncertainty for investors. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 25 and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> was up | at 39 -LRB-, but <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> dropped \ to 28 -RRB-.

 Housing construction posted the biggest increase in more than a year as new projects climbed by 8.9 percent in February, while industrial production edged up 0.2 percent, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last month's gain in housing construction raised activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units. The increase followed declines of 1.9 percent in January and 15.8 percent in December. The unexpectedly strong February report was likely to ease worries about a possible recession. The 8.9 percent rise in housing starts in February was the sharpest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986. The increase in February industrial production represented the fifth consecutive monthly gain, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the advance followed a 0.3 percent increase in January and left <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry operating at a rate 5.8 percent above a year ago. Analysts said the report was consistent with their view that the economy will continue to move forward this year, but at a slower pace than in 1987. On Tuesday, a jump in early March auto sales and news of a record 1987 trade deficit failed to wield much influence in the financial markets. Major automakers said Tuesday that sales of domestic cars and light trucks rose 6.3 percent in the first 10 days of March compared with a year earlier, led by surging sales of vehicles made by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Industry leader <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported weaker results In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the broadest measure of foreign trade surged to a record $ 160.7 billion in 1987, a reflection of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s deepening debt to the rest of the world. The deficit in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account was 13.7 percent higher than the 1986 deficit of $ 141.4 billion and marked the fifth consecutive year that this trade deficit has hit a new record. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sought to downplay the significance of the trade deficits, but private economists contend the rapid buildup of foreign debt could cause a further weakening in the dollar's value and a recession. The current account measures not only the flow of merchandise across <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders but also the flow of services, primarily investment earnings. Net debtor status means Americans own less investments abroad than foreigners do in this country. Despite the latest trade statistics, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Tuesday that Americans should n't be overly concerned and that foreign investors make `` good corporate citizens.'' `` We will find that foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be a plus,'' even at present record levels, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Neither the auto sales or foreign trade figures had much impact on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where stocks were mixed in light trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 2.66 points to 2,047.41. Prices in the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates and the economy, also ended little changed.

 Housing construction posted the biggest increase in more than a year as new projects climbed by 8.9 percent in February, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase last month pushed construction activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units. The increase followed declines of 1.9 percent in January and 15.8 percent in December. Those back-to-back monthly declines, which left housing starts at their slowest pace since the end of the last recession, had raised fears of a possible new economic downturn in the wake of the record collapse of the stock market in October. Pessimists noted that housing is often the first sector to turn down at the onset of a new recession. However, the big jump in housing activity in February, which was much stronger than expected, was likely to ease worries about a possible recession this year, especially since other business barometers including employment gains, have shown strength since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. In another report today, the government said that production at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percent in February following a 0.3 percent January gain. It was the fifth consecutive increase and left <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry producing at a 5.8 percent higher level than a year ago. Economists said the increase in housing starts, while still leaving them well below the level of a year ago, was a good sign that the industry's two-month skid had been halted. `` The rebound in housing is yet another sign of an economy that is growing slowly but is far from a recession,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. `` The lower interest rates enjoyed by the mortgage market in late January through February have revived what had seemed to be a dying housing sector.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected that mortgage rates, which are currently at an average of 9.96 percent for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, will not likely fall further but should stay around that level for the next several months. The 8.9 percent rise in housing starts in February was the sharpest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986. Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economic activity, also rose sharply in February, jumping 11.5 percent to an annual rate of 1.40 million units, also the biggest monthly gain since December 1986. Many economists had been predicting a rebound in housing, given the fact that mortgage rates have fallen sharply since the first of the year and are again in the single-digit range. The strength in starts last month came in the construction of both single-family and multi-family housing. Construction of single-family homes rose 9.3 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted 1.10 million units. Construction of multi-family units was up 7.8 percent to an annual rate of 399,000 units. The strength was widespread in all sections of the country except the West, where starts fell 9 percent. Housing starts rose 25.6 percent in the South, 13.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and 2.7 percent in the Northeast.

Western Auto's stock, which is traded on the over-the-counter market, was up $ 6 to $ 18.50 a share in early trading today.

Under the $ 700 million merger agreement, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> would not be obligated for claims from users of the intrauterine device until the final order is entered after appeals. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> said he found that provision unacceptable. `` I'm not going to delay this any more.

<TEXT>
 Brisk exports will help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s economy grow by at least 8 percent this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said In its revised economic management program issued Wednesday, the agency forecast that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s gross national product would swell to the equivalent of $ 145 billion, up 8 percent from last year. That would boost the country's per capita GNP for this year to $ 3,450, up $ 637 from last year, the planning board said. Under the original projections, 1988 GNP was expected to reach $ 124 billion for a per capita GNP of $ 2,922. The GNP is the total output of goods and services a country produces in a year. Government officials said stronger-than-expected exports so far this year have prompted them to revise the projections upward. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s merchandise exports during January and February reached $ 8.01 billion, up 39.9 percent from the same period last year. At that pace, total 1988 exports would rise to $ 55 billion and imports to $ 50 billion, creating a trade surplus of $ 5 billion, according to the revised figures. The projected trade surplus, combined with an expected surplus of $ 2 billion in invisible trade items such as tourism income, would help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> register a current-account surplus of $ 7 billion this year. Helped by strong exports, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s current-account surplus more than doubled to $ 9.78 billion last year from the 1986 level. The current account measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers. The projected current-account surplus would help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> trim its external debts to $ 31 billion from $ 35.6 billion at the end of last year, the agency said. An additional 354,000 new jobs would be created this year but the unemployment rate would rise to 3.7 percent from 3.1 percent last year, it said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A.E. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> traveled with <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, has authored best-selling books and scripted plays. This is not the man one expects to find running a food business, but there he is, assuming the role of entrepreneur at the behest of another of his famous friends, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. Listening to <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> talk, one gets the feeling he is also incredulous _ even after six years _ to find himself in charge of <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Own </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 40 million-a-year business <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> calls `` this wacko food thing.'' And the author's wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, a former researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also seems a little bewildered to be overseeing the day-to-day operations of a company that manufactures salad dressing, spaghetti sauce, lemonade and popcorn. So, how did these neophytes get into the business? By the persistence and persuasiveness of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, the star of films such as `` The Hustler'' and `` Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and the president of <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own. They started the company in 1982, with a vinaigrette dressing. `` <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> was always into salad dressing,'' <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> recalled during a recent interview. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> said the actor had his own homemade dressing. When he visited friends, he took bottles of it with him. He gave it as Christmas presents. One Christmas, he beseeched <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON>, his longtime friend and neighbor in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to help fill wine bottles with dressing, and when there was some left over, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> got the notion of selling it. `` I did everything to ignore him,'' <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> would n't let go of the idea. While he went off to film `` The Verdict,'' he put his friend to work, setting up a salad dressing company. `` He would call from the movie set between takes: ` Hotch, how are we doing? You got a bottler?''' the author recalled. `` He drove me nuts.'' With a $ 40,000 investment, they began to market the dressing locally in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` We did n't know what we were doing,'' <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> admitted. But after two months they began to get orders from major supermarket chains like <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and A & amp; P. So they hired <ORGANIZATION> Advantage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION>, a company on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> that found factories, set up a national distribution network and arranged for publicity. The salad dressing, with a drawing of <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> smiling expansively on the label, became enormously successful. The Hotchners became corporate vice presidents. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> sounds like he still does not believe it all happened. `` It was 80 percent luck,'' he said. The <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> aura was a major factor in their initial success, <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> admitted. But, he said, what has kept the company going since then is its insistence on quality. `` You can get acceptance because of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s face on the label, but what's in the bottle better be good,'' he said. While quality was a major concern, profits were n't. `` ` Look, we do n't intend to be food tycoons, so let's just give it all away,''' <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> as saying. In the six years since <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own began, it has donated $ 15 million to charity and helped set up a camp for seriously ill children. People expected <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own to come out with another dressing after the vinaigrette caught on, but as Mrs. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> put it, `` We do n't do logical things.'' So, next came spaghetti sauce, followed by popcorn and most recently, lemonade. As its product base expanded, the company's sales grew by 20 percent a year, <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> _ the A.E. stands for <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> _ is a 67-year-old <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> native who attended <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, became a lawyer but hated it and then went off to serve in World War II. After the war, he worked for Cosmopolitan magazine, and while on an assignment in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1948, met <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> _ `` not a bad way to be introduced to <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>,'' he now says _ and other cities. He hunted with <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, watched bullfights with him and drank with him. <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> killed himself in 1961. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> wrote of their friendship in his best-known work, `` Papa Hemingway.'' It was <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> who indirectly brought the future food makers together. In 1956, <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> was asked to adapt a three-page <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> story, `` The Battler,'' for television. One of the actors in the drama was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. The two men became friends, and later, neighbors in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, an affluent suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They owned boats and fished together, but `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and I never got involved in anything over the years other than mischief until this wacko food thing came up,'' <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> said. He sounds disparaging of the business and his own role in it, but he's committed to it, fielding inquiries from <ORGANIZATION> Advantage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> at 7:45 a.m. if necessary. He manages to keep his literary projects going, but said he sometimes feels like he's a juggler who `` has one apple too many.'' Both <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> and his wife give a lot of credit for the success of <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own to <ORGANIZATION> Advantage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON>, a vice president at the marketing company. `` He was out there hustling,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> said. `` He believed in us.'' <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON> handles what <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> calls the nitty-gritty of the business, dealing with the factories and workers. But there is still enough to keep the Hotchners busy. The night before the interview, Mrs. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where she met with one of the company's international distributors. Mrs. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON>, 44, a native of <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, is in the <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own office in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> almost every day, supervising a staff of five people. Although they began as amateurs, the <PERSON> Hotchners </PERSON> said they have learned plenty about the angles of running a food business. In the early going, for example, they discovered that if they discounted <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own products, supermarkets would pay faster and the company would have the cash to pay its own bills. But the couple is well aware that unlike most business people, they have the luxury of nothing to lose. `` We do n't have to produce $ 3 million every month,'' <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON> said. `` No heads are going to fall. No executives are going to be out on the street.'' `` It's not like anything else,'' he said. `` It's mostly fun.''

<HEAD>Sex Discrimination Suit Hailed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge approved a settlement Tuesday of a sex-discrimination suit against <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that grants women who were denied jobs as insurance agents in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> up to $ 420,000 each. The settlement, restricted to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> because the case was filed as a state class-action suit, also requires that 50 percent of the sales agents hired by the company during the next 10 years be women. Lawyers for three women who sued on behalf of the discrimination victims said the total award could range between $ 100 million and $ 300 million, a record for a civil rights suit, based on 1,100 jobs that were filled between 1974 and 1987, the years covered by the suit. But company lawyers say the payment estimate is far too high in light of the stringent test claimants will have to meet. To qualify for an award, a woman must not only show that she was rejected or was discouraged from applying for an agent's job during the period, but also convince a court-appointed fact-finder that she was more qualified than the man who was hired. She would then collect between $ 15,575 and $ 420,822, which includes the amount of pay she was wrongfully denied and interest on that figure. The women would receive additional interest from now until the date they are paid. The suit was filed in 1979 by three former company secretaries, <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraszewski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, who has since died. Under the settlement, each, including Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s estate, will get the maximum award of $ 420,822. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> ruled in 1985 that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> had discriminated against women in hiring, prompting the settlement negotiations. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> approved the settlement Tuesday after a brief hearing, calling it fair and comprehensive. He deferred a ruling, however, on whether some women would be allowed to sue separately in state court on discrimination claims. The four-month claims period will begin May 1. Women who applied for jobs with the company between 1974 and 1987 will be mailed claim forms, said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Saperstein </PERSON>, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.

 Aspiring Wall Street broker <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> thought he had a deal that could n't go wrong. He would make a killing in the stock market by trading on inside information about secret takeover plans for <ORGANIZATION> Bluestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> _ the fictional focus of the movie `` Wall Street'' _ did n't count on getting nailed by a computer His trades sent the airline stock into an erratic flight pattern, which sounded an alarm in the control tower of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. As it might have unfolded in real life, the exchange's `` stock watch'' monitors triggered an investigation that resulted in <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s arrest for securities fraud Collaring Wall Street's bad guys is not always so easy, but the movie turned the spotlight on a surveillance system that has become the first line of defense against abuse in the stock market. `` They stole it from us,'' joked <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for market surveillance, who supervises a staff of more than 100 At the center of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s operation are four analysts who scrutinize oddly behaving stocks from a carpeted, glass-walled office crammed with computer terminals and newswire printers high above the exchange floor. <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>'s detectives have played roles in exposing some of the biggest insider traders in history, ranging from former <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON> to ex-investment banker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. In an era marked by takeover speculation and daily volume that has multiplied 12-fold over 20 years, tracking suspicious trades has become a high-tech adventure. `` In 1965, we averaged a few million shares a day. We read ticker tape and clipped items from the papers,'' said <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> career began then as an investigator. `` You did n't have all the mergers and acquisition stuff.'' On a typical trading day now, dozens of computer alerts about unusual stock activity go off in the monitoring rooms at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and American exchanges in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> on-line office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which follows over-the-counter trading. The computers are programmed to know the price and volume behavior of every listed issue over the past several months, which stock watchers call a parameter or `` fingerprint.'' When a sleepy stock suddenly jumps in value, the computers send out their warnings. They range from colored lights at the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> to a synthesized voice that shouts `` high price!'' or `` volume!'' in the Amex's `` Stockwatch Automated Technique'' system, dubbed `` SWAT'' for short `` It does n't mean by necessity there's a violation,'' said <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>. `` But when you have a 200 million-share day you need that computer support to guide the analysts. Once those flags or whistles go off, we try to ascertain whether there's public news to account for it.'' The news could include relatively innocuous events such as a dividend payment, earnings report, stock repurchase or a buy recommendation from a respected investment firm. When 32.4 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> stock changed hands March 8, for example, <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> analysts ignored their computer's red-alert, the most serious warning They knew investors were trading the stock based on the company's quarterly dividend. When more than 600 million shares were traded during the Oct. 19 crash, volume warnings blazed across every computer screen, but analysts paid little heed because massive selling affected many stocks. If an analyst can not determine the source of a stock's curious behavior, the next step is to call the exchange floor for an explanation. The analyst also might call the company and brokers who traded the stock. `` More times than not it takes more than something on the screen to figure it out,'' said <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>. `` It does n't flash, ` insider trader.''' If questions persist, a mysterious trading pattern might be referred to an exchange investigator and possibly the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is ultimately responsible for enforcing securities laws. A common example is a stock that suspiciously rises in price, suggesting an impending takeover that has n't been disclosed. Insiders with advance knowledge of that information might be buying illegally, knowing the stock's price will jump after the takeover is announced. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has sharply increased its prosecution of these insider trading violations over the past few years. But in most cases, the agency must rely partly on evidence of wrongdoing supplied by the stock markets themselves. `` I guess we're more like the cops on the beat,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, head of the Amex system in a cramped office 10 stories above the trading floor. `` I think we deter members from getting involved in shady things. They know what we do.'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> oversees three analysts who work in perhaps the most advanced surveillance system of any exchange, with synthesized-voice computers that not only shout warnings but also read news from a financial information service to advise analysts of market-sensitive developments. The Amex operation also includes about 60 staffers who follow up leads uncovered by the stock watchers. Like the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amex </ORGANIZATION>'s system has been credited for exposing many illicit trades, notably the conspiracy that resulted in the arrest and conviction of former <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> a few years ago. <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> had peddled advance knowledge of his `` Heard on the Street'' column, which often influenced the price of a stock he wrote about. In a typical day, <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>'s stock watchers will arrive an hour before the exchange opens and talk with floor traders to acquaint themselves with the latest news and gossip. They also will scour the newspapers and overnight copy from financial wire services. The Amex computer ordinarily will record about 100 daily alerts, called `` kickouts'' or `` parameter breaks.'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said about half are readily explainable and the others require further inquiry. Ultimately, a few might be referred to an Amex investigator and about 50 a year are referred to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> stock watchers conduct a similar screening process, also referring about 50 trades a year to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON> did n't disclose the number of outstanding in-house inquiries but said it exceeds 100 Does the operation deter wrongdoers? `` In a broad sense I would say yes,'' observed <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>. `` But if somebody wants to be a crook, they're going to be one, irrespective of the bells and alarms that are available to us.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board today rejected a $ 1.27 billion takeover bid from a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and said it is mulling a recapitalization plan to fend off unwanted suitors. British investor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, who heads the London-based construction concern, and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 45-per-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' common shares on March 3. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> management today called the offer inadequate and recommended stockholders not tender their shares. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a British investment bank, reportedly own about 7.45 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' outstanding common shares The Pittsburgh-based road builder and manufacturer of construction materials said in a statement its board is `` considering alternative plans intended to enhance shareholder values both immediately and over the long term.'' <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 75 cents to $ 53.75 in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after jumping $ 2.25 on Tuesday. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chairman, said the board is considering a recapitalization plan that would involve a `` substantial cash distribution or dividend'' to common shareholders. He said the company will explore the sale of some or all of its construction materials and services business, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the dividend payout. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> has said it probably would sell <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemical business if it gained control. <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said a recapitalization also could include the sale of stock to an employee stock ownership plan that the company would establish. `` <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' board believes that the company remaining independent would, over the long term, be a superior alternative to accepting'' the buyout offer, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Beazer-Shearson </LOCATION> offer to pay $ 107.75 for each of the 150,000 outstanding shares of preferred stock was adequate but declined to advise preferred shareholders whether to tender their stock. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> made their bid through <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 In October 1983, a computer at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> sounded an alarm about <ORGANIZATION> TIE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> shares, which were slipping in extraordinarily active trading. It was the beginning of the end for the career of <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>, a Wall Street Journal reporter who played a key role in what would become one of the most publicized insider trading conspiracies in history. A day after the TIE alarm, a negative story about the company appeared in <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>' `` Heard on the Street'' column, which made the stock tumble even more. `` It looked like it was intentionally made to do a job on TIE,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Amex </ORGANIZATION> stock watch unit, where suspicions arose that something was seriously wrong. Shortly thereafter, the Amex computer sounded the alarm about <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> shares, which were falling in heavy volume. A few days later, a negative story about Key appeared in the `` Heard'' column and TIE pattern repeated itself. `` Then we alerted our surveillance department, saying, ` This is amazing. Definitely look at this sucker,'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> recalled. Amex investigators began checking records to determine which brokerages had been active in TIE and Key in the days before the `` Heard'' columns appeared. Their inquiries showed significant trading was done by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>, then a star trader for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and two of <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>'s friends, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Felis </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Before TIE and Key fell, they had been aggressively buying `` put options'' on the stocks, entitling them to sell at a certain price within a specified time. The options soared in value when the stocks declined. <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigators were alerted, and eventually the Journal's senior management. It was almost certain that <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Felis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had known the pre-publication contents of the `` Heard'' column. Faced with exposure, <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> of a secret arrangement under which he would leak advance word of the `` Heard'' column to <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> and the broker would share the trading profits he made with <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>' male lover, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>. All were prosecuted for insider trading. In a book about the conspiracy, <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> wrote that none of the participants had been aware market stock watchers would be alerted by their trading, especially <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>, who had `` muscled his way into TIE like a refugee trying to catch the last helicopter out of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>.'' In hindsight, <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> wrote, `` fewer people would have noticed what <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> was doing if he'd hired a skywriter.'' Despite the success of such surveillance in the Winans case, market officials concede other instances of blatant abuse can be hard to identify. A good example was the insider trading done by <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, a notorious speculator who was exposed by co-conspirator <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. Using secret tips about impending takeovers supplied by <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a former investment banker, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> made millions of dollars buy acquiring stocks of acquisition targets. `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was not a name that was foreign to us; in fact we had tracked a number of trades by <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> over a long period of time,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> stock watch unit. `` But it's like seeing a woodsman in the forest,'' <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON> said. `` We expected him to be there. Because as a big player, we knew and were able to see he was in many deals, many times. And there was no discernible pattern.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> stock watchers had better luck with <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who did all his illicit trading under a phony name through an account at the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss bank. <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON> said his analysts forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> about two dozen suspicious trading patterns over a period of several years that originated from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leu </ORGANIZATION> account. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigators used that information to help identify <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. `` Beyond <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leu </ORGANIZATION>, because of a jurisdictional problem, we had to rely on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON> said. `` But we do take partial credit.''

 The stock market drifted lower in quiet trading today, continuing the sluggish pattern of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.94 to 2,037.47 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 511 up, 770 down and 543 unchanged. The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade balance for January. Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those expectations, analysts believe the market would n't feel any great shock effects. But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either way. After the trade report, the market is also faced with a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock index options and futures that will be settled Friday. That too may pass quietly, brokers say, but until it is over it adds an additional element of uncertainty for investors.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Production Fell, Imports Rose in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Domestic crude oil production dropped again last month, while increased imports continued to feed the nation's ever-growing thirst for petroleum-based products, a trade group reported Wednesday The nation's output of crude dropped 1.8 percent from January to 8.16 million barrels a day _ a fall of 11 percent from the level of two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in its monthly report. At the same time, daily imports averaged 6.66 million barrels of crude and products, which was up 14.8 percent from 5.8 million barrels a day in February 1987, the Washington-based group said. That marked a 38 percent increase in imports from February 1986, when the nation bought 4.84 million barrels of foreign crude and products each day, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastelic </PERSON>, an API spokesman. A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons. February's deliveries of refined products increased by 2.5 percent, or 417,000 barrels daily, reflecting expected trends in actual consumption after an unusual 7 percent year-to-year leap in January, the report said. Gasoline led the increase in deliveries of refined products, rising 2.6 percent from last February. On a year-to-date basis, however, this worked out to an expected 2 percent gain when adjusted for unusual factors, the trade group said. The report said annual domestic consumption of motor fuels has grown by 2.2 percent to 3.2 percent a year in the 1982-1987 period, as Americans traveled nearly 3.8 percent more each year. Among other highlights, the API reported that: _ February deliveries of home heating oil and diesel fuel were essentially flat, compared with February 1987, partly because weather in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states was warmer than usual _ Heavy fuel oil, known as residual fuel oil, rose 2 percent from the previous February, apparently reflecting `` the competitive nature of the fuel in the electric utility and industrial markets. _ Kerosine jet fuel deliveries fell a sharp 3.5 percent from a year ago, in part because of heavy inventory buildup in January _ The utilization rate of the nation's refineries slackened to 81.9 percent from an average 83 percent use over the winter months, as the winter heating season wound down _ Inventories of crude and products dropped 1.6 percent from January and 2 pecent from February 1987

 A son of late oil billionaire <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> will become a majority stockholder in <ORGANIZATION> DeltaUS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under an agreement reached with the financially troubled Tyler drilling company. The 57-year-old Delta USCorp. last turned a profit in the oil boom year of 1981. An unnamed corporation owned wholly by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> is to pay $ 7 million for newly issued shares of common stock in <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, giving <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> 75 percent ownership of the Tyler company, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeppa </PERSON> said Tuesday. The agreement also calls for the Getty-owned corporation to provide <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> with a $ 2.5 million cash infusion to help finance its weakened drilling operations. <PERSON> Zeppa </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> suffered a net loss in excess of $ 10 million last year on revenues of $ 51 million. The company has 1,100 employees, less than half its peak employment of about 2,400 workers in 1982. Only 13 of its 50 U.S.-based rigs are active, <PERSON> Zeppa </PERSON> said. Six of seven Delta rigs in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> are in operation. The agreement with <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> should `` give us the ability to withstand worse-case conditions for three to four years and still be around when things turn up -LRB- in the drilling industry -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Zeppa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zeppa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> does not anticipate any changes in management or current operations. <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, 54, is a resident of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and reportedly has no plans to assume an executive role with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> played a major role in 1984 merger talks involving <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> wound up making a higher bid and buying the California-based company A <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury in 1985 awarded the largest court judgment in history _ $ 10.53 billion _ to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, which had argued that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had improperly interfered with the proposed Pennzoil-Getty merger. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has since agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 billion to settle the case.

<TEXT>
 Scientists at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have made and tested the world's fastest silicon circuits, the company said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the experimental circuits could switch on and off 75 billion times a second, twice as fast as the fastest silicon transistors known to date. The extra speed was made possible by shrinking the circuit parts down to a tenth of a micron across, which is one-thousandth the width of a human hair and only a few hundred atoms wide. The company cautioned that complex problems remain to be solved before entire chips can be made that take full advantage of the experimental transistors. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s advance helps close the speed gap between silicon and gallium arsenide, another kind of semiconducting material that is faster than silicon but more expensive and harder to work with. The fastest gallium arsenide circuits can switch on and off about 200 billion times a second, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its scientists have put a superconducting film on a silicon chip and gotten it to work at temperatures warmer than liquid nitrogen, the first such achievement. The matching of a superconductor and silicon is considered important because of silicon's dominance in the microelectronics field, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said in an announcement for release Thursday. `` Virtually all of the world's microchips are made from silicon, so if you want to use the new superconducting materials in any way in microelectronics, it is advantageous to be able to deposit them on this substrate,'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogro-Campero </PERSON>, who did the research along with <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, said in a statement. Previous attempts to apply a superconducting film on silicon had failed because the layers mixed in the process of heating the film, known as annealing. Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s research center in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, solved the problem by using a buffer layer of zirconia, a heat-resistant metallic oxide. GE said the thin film remained superconducting _ that is, with zero loss of energy to resistance _ at temperatures as high as 310 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, 10 degrees above the point at which nitrogen becomes liquid.

The plumbing and air conditioning maker has said it was negotiating with several potential buyers, including one willing to pay at least $ 2.4 billion. American Standard's board was meeting today to consider definitive bids arising out of talks with other suitors, spokeswoman <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. The result of the meeting was considered pivotal to the outcome of a six-week takeover battle that has pushed <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price from $ 38 to an all-time high above $ 75 a share In a related development today that might influence the fight, a judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated, granted a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> request at least temporarily prohibiting American Standard from making defensive changes in its retirement and severence pay plan. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> had argued the changes would cost the company more money only if it were acquired by a third party, while producing little effect under a recapitalization plan <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> is considering, said <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimet </PERSON>. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said the company was reviewing internal financial information supplied by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> and was expected to make a decision on whether to offer a new bid. If <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> does n't submit a new bid, it would be taking the chance that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s management might strike a deal with another bidder, she acknowledged. Industry analysts said that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s internal five-year growth projections, made public by <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Decker Monday, appeared to back a bid in the $ 75-a-share range. `` Taken at face value, these numbers seem to support a bid higher than $ 73, but it's hard to say whether they support a bid higher than $ 75,'' said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. Brown & amp; Sons in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` There's a significant downside to these numbers because they're based on a pretty optimistic scenario.'' He said a $ 73 bid would enhance <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s aim of broadening its earnings base but questioned whether that objective would be reached at a higher price. Other analysts noted that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s estimates are based on a business climate similar to that of the past year. <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the projections do n't reflectthe cyclical downturn expected to affect the building supplies industry, to which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> sells air-conditioning and plumbing products. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stults </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION>, said a bid in the $ 75 range might be attractive to a company that specializes in buying going concerns and selling them off in parts.

 The Soviet Oil Ministry and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Italian and Japanese companies signed an agreement Wednesday that would create the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest joint business venture with foreigners. Under the $ 6 billion deal, the venture would build and operate a petrochemical complex off the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. It is expected to produce 400,000 tons of polypropylene, 600,000 tons of polyethylene and more than 1 million tons of granulated sulfur annually. Polypropylene and polyehylene are used to make plastics. The foreign partners are <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the Italian companies of <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Enichem </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marubeni </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Officials of the four companies signed a preliminary agreement with Soviet representatives on Wednesday, committing them to study plans for the petrochemical complex for nine months before completing a long-range contract. <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> said the Soviets had invited the four companies to establish the joint venture. `` It reflects the necessity for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to get involved in the world market and the necessity for Western firms to get closer to sources of raw materials in order to process them more efficiently at the sites,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has vast natural resources, and is the world's largest oil producer <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkov </PERSON>, Soviet oil minister, told a news conference that housing for the petrochemical workers, roads, a railroad link, electricity and communications facilities are under construction for the complex, which will be built near the western Kazakh town of <LOCATION> Kulsary </LOCATION>. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Dinkov </PERSON> said, gas and oil extraction facilities are to be operating next year, with refining plants following within the next few years. Oil reserves in the deposit, known as the Tengiz Oil Field, are estimated at between 14 billion and 17.5 billion barrels, <PERSON> Dinkov </PERSON> said. Foreign participants will hold a total of no more than 49 percent of the joint venture's capital, with the rest held by the Soviet government. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> told the news conference each of the foreign partners will invest $ 750 million in the project, and the Soviets will put in $ 3 billion. The Western partners will utilize bank financing, he said. Previous joint ventures, which have sprung up under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s overhaul of the Soviet economy, have been worth in the millions of dollars. The foreign partners will sell half the complex's products abroad. The Soviets will sell the other half, either domestically or on the world market. Hammer, whose business ties with the Soviets date to the 1920s, expressed confidence that the Western partners will find the deal financially satisfying. `` We're not here for charitable purposes,'' he said. `` We, each of the four companies, expect to make profits.''

 The stock market declined slightly in quiet trading today, continuing the sluggish pattern of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.11 to 2,038.30 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 557 up, 797 down and 549 unchanged. The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade balance for January. Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those expectations, analysts believe the market would n't feel any great shock effects. But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either way. After the trade report, the market is also faced with a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock index options and futures that will be settled Friday. That too may pass quietly, brokers say, but until it is over it adds an additional element of uncertainty for investors.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is expanding its role in specialty retailing with a plan announced Wednesday to buy <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 402 million deal. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it was buying 52.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> stock from officers, directors and others for $ 19 a share and will make a tender offer for the remainder of the stock at the same price. The acquisition will cost the nation's biggest retailer $ 250 million. It also will assume the auto supply company's $ 152 million debt. Western Auto's stock, traded on the over-the-counter market, rose $ 5.87 -LCB- a share to $ 18.37 -LCB- by Wednesday afternoon. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landschultz </PERSON>, a financial analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Mesirow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said this was probably the first of several steps <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> would take to increase its presence in the specialty field. `` This move does several things that were needed,'' said <PERSON> Landschultz </PERSON>. First, he said, it gets <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> out of the major malls where it has had a dominent influence and into the smaller markets. It also capitalizes on <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' strength in automotive parts and equipment. Western Auto sells auto supplies, tires, appliances and lawn and garden equipment through nearly 2,000 stores nationwide. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> company operates 278 retail stores it owns, and sells wholesale to 1,570 independently owned Western Auto outlets. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundegard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, will remain as head of the auto supply unit and will report to <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' specialty merchandising. These personnel decisions are significant, said <PERSON> Landschultz </PERSON>. `` It's very important that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lundegard </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- stays in place,'' he said, adding that <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> has been extremely successful in the specialty field. The acquisition would represent <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' further expansion into specialty marketing. It previously bought apparel and optical chains. But the Western Auto deal is the first significant move in this direction, said <PERSON> Landschultz </PERSON>. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 10.5 million on sales of $ 930.8 million. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.65 billion and had revenues of $ 48.44 billion.

In January 1979, he sold 30 shares for $ 1.3 million. In November, he agreed with his three partners to sell his remaining 26 shares for $ 50,000 and ended all business relations. Three years later he sued his brother and his other two former partners, charging them with securities fraud. He claimed that between the times of the two transactions, the three conspired to deceive him about the condition of Appendagez so they could buy him out for less than his remaining shares were worth.

 The stock market showed some spotty losses in quiet trading today, continuing the sluggish pattern of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.30 to 2,041.11 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 604 up, 840 down and 489 unchanged. The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade balance for January. Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those expectations, analysts believe the market would n't feel any great shock effects. But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either way. After the trade report, the market is also faced with a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock index options and futures that will be settled Friday.

Only 13 percent of the respondents said they have shifted investment strategies since the October stock market crash, with several noting they prefer `` later-stage'' companies that may present less risk.

<HEAD>Overhaul Efforts Hurting Financial Foundation Of Defense Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Efforts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to overhaul defense contracting policies since 1984 are having the unintended effect of dissolving the financial foundation of the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms business, an industry-sponsored study said Tuesday. The new policies, taken together, are beginning to reduce the industry's profitability to the point that contractors will not be able to attract new investors, nor will they be able to sustain their private research efforts, the study says. That, in turn, is going to `` slow the rate of technological growth and result in a loss of -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- technological leadership,'' the study adds. `` Our findings should concern those in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and DoD who believe that a strong, research-and-development and investment-oriented defense industry is a key factor in maintaining the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' military strength,'' the authors wrote. The study, entitled `` The Impact on Defense Industrial Capability of Changes in Procurement and Tax Policy, 1984-1987,'' was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The research was funded by the three associations but performed independently by The <ORGANIZATION> MAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a management consulting firm based in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The three associations asked the consultant to analyze the combined impact of a number of recent changes in the defense procurement world, ranging from an end to certain tax deferral benefits; a reduction in profit markup allowances; a cut in the percentage of money paid out monthly for work in progress, and requirements that industry pay for more of the upfront costs of research and development. Those changes were all enacted or promulgated during the period from 1984 to 1987 `` and were introduced in a piecemeal fashion,'' the study found. `` We find no evidence that the combined impact of the changes was studied by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>,'' it said. While the effects of the changes may be absorbed on an individual basis, the combined impact is devastating, the study said. To demonstrate, the authors collected actual data from nine contractors on nine large weapons programs and then applied the various tax and contracting changes as if they had been in effect from the start of the programs. `` The return on investment on the programs analyzed would have been less than the return necessary to preserve shareholder value,'' the report stated. `` Put simply, there would have been no financial reason to bid the programs. Profits will be substantially reduced _ by an average of 23 percent on the companies' defense business.'' As a result of slower cash flows and lower profits, defense contractors are almost assuredly going to have to begin borrowing heavily, the report continued. Using the case studies, `` the additional financing required to fill the gap caused by the changes _ $ 8.5 billion _ is equivalent to 50 percent of the total 1985 equity of the companies in our study.'' The industry is unlikely to be able to raise that kind of money, meaning it will have to slow plant modernization and curtail private research. `` Competition will be reduced because there will be fewer competitors willing to bid on future programs. And a financially weakened industry will be less able to compete against growing, and sometimes subsidized, foreign competition.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Pentagon might not like it, but the only real answer is to restore to contractors some of the profitability they have lost when performing defense work, the study concluded. `` Equally important, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should ensure that the type of uncoordinated policy change that led to this unintended outcome is not repeated,'' it said.

<HEAD>Murdoch's Company to Acquire Australian Press Agency, Get Big

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an international media company controlled by publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, said Wednesday it had arranged to buy nearly all the shares of Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pty </ORGANIZATION>. That company, which is no relation to the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, distributes news and photographs throughout <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. It owns a 7.75 percent voting stake in <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the large British news and information service. If <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s acquisition succeeds, his company would become the biggest single shareholder in <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> already owns a 6.8 percent voting stake in <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which had owned 44.65 percent of the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said it had acquired another 8.3 percent from <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a concern controlled by Australian investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court. <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it also had agreed to acquire a 44.65 percent stake from <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s major media companies. Prices were n't disclosed. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, a native Australian who became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1985, already controls about 60 percent of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s press and has encountered government resistance to an expansion from government antitrust officials. It was not immediately clear whether <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s arrangement to effectively acquire the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> would be blocked by the government. But an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates such transactions, said it would investigate.

 A federal judge approved the <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s merger pact with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday after <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> agreed to put $ 100 million toward <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claims before its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case is completed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who earlier in the day had raised questions about the merger deal, signed an order to execute the agreement in the wake of the pharmaceutical company's offer, said <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> spokesman The $ 100 million would cover administrative costs to set up a Dalkon Shield trust fund that eventually will grow to $ 2.475 billion, the amount <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> said is needed to pay claims against the intrauterine birth-control device. The claims covered by the initial funding would be smaller amounts to women who show minimal proof of Dalkon Shield use and injury, said <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> spokesman. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON>, citing years of delay in paying <LOCATION> Dalkon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shield </LOCATION> claims, refused to ratify the merger unless it allowed some compensation before the company's reorganization became final. The surprise ruling sent attorneys in the 2 -LCB- - year-old bankruptcy case back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise that would allow payments of some claims pending expected appeals of the reorganization `` You know it's coming. I know it's coming,'' <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> told the attorneys of expected court challenges. `` But we ca n't wait any longer.'' <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON>'s objection involved a section of the merger agreement that would allow the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to acquire <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> through a $ 700 million exchange of stock, to back out after one year, if appeals of the court's confirmation order for <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' reorganization plan are still pending. Putting off payments of injury claims against the intrauterine device until all appeals are resolved and a final order approving the reorganization is entered would be unacceptable, the judge said. Instead, the judge suggested that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> put up $ 100 million to begin paying claims pendig appeal. If the reorganization is later voided, he said, then <ORGANIZATION> AHP </ORGANIZATION> could recover the money from <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>. `` I'm not going to delay this any more,'' he said. `` These women have waited and waited and waited.'' Under the agreement reached later Wednesday, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> will put up the $ 100 million instead of <ORGANIZATION> AHP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> said. Until the hearing before <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>, there were no known hitches with the merger, except for a $ 25 million breakup claim against <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> and Rorer, a suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> drug manufacturer, had reached a tentative merger pact late last year But in subsequent talks involving Rorer, <ORGANIZATION> AHP </ORGANIZATION> and a third potential <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' buyer, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sanofi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, officials of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> offer. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> said he would conduct a hearing on the Rorer claim at a later time. The American Home deal, reached Jan. 19, had been endorsed by attorneys for 195,000 women with <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claims and by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> stockholders. In addition to the $ 2.475 billion Dalkon Shield trust fund, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' trade creditors would receive full payment of claims. When the merger proposal came up in court, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebsky </PERSON> said the plan `` happily is largely consensual.'' But <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> surprised attorneys by announcing, `` I have a problem.'' The judge said <ORGANIZATION> AHP </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal option put an unnecessary delay on paying claims unless the appeals court ordered a freeze on payments pending a resolution of the case. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in August 1985 as millions of dollars in claims mounted against the Dalkon Shield. The company distributed about 4.5 million of the IUDs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad in the early 1970s. At the time it entered bankruptcy court, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> had settled 9,500 of 15,000 <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> lawsuits with payments of about $ 530 million. Injury claims have ranged from pelvic infections to sterility.

<HEAD>Dollar Firmer in Cautious Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Precede LONDON BC</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar firmed slightly against most major currencies Wednesday, but traders remained cautious in advance of new trade data to be released Thursday. Gold prices edged lower in domestic trading after climbing overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 445 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $ 1 from late Tuesday. Analysts said the foreign-exchange markets remained relatively quiet in anticipation of the government's January trade figures, which are expected to show a small increase in the monthly trade deficit. Although estimates have varied, most traders now expect the deficit for January to total somewhere between $ 13 billion and $ 14 billion, compared with $ 12.2 billion in December. A figure at the low end of the range would be a boon to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency; a high-end number would revive the downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The dollar has been pressured lower in the past by trade reports showing a growing imbalance of imports over exports. But as recent reports have shown improvement in the trade gap, the currency has stabilized. In advance of the latest report, traders were reluctant `` to step up and buy the dollar,'' according to <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The currency managed its slight gains in response to better-than-expected government reports on housing construction and industrial production. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said housing starts jumped 8.9 percent in February, while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percent during the month. Both appeared to be positive signs for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Because it is viewed as a safe haven in times of international turmoil, the dollar also drew strength from reports of an attempted coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and of a Nicaraguan attack on Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the trading day begins, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to a closing 127.49. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 127.37 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 127.455 yen, up from 127.375 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound slipped to $ 1.8505, cheaper for buyers than late Tuesday's $ 1.8570. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.84925, up from $ 1.8455 late Tuesday. Other dollar rates late Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late trading Tuesday, included: 1.67395 West German marks, up from 1.66985; 1.3854 Swiss francs, up from 1.3805; 1.2535 Canadian dollars, down from 1.25385; 5.6894 French francs, up from 5.6660; and 1,242.00 Italian lire, up from 1,232.40. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday included: 1.6690 West German marks, up from 1.6650; 1.3810 Swiss francs, up from 1.3760; 5.6782 French francs, up from 5.6605; 1.8750 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8705; 1,238.45 Italian lire, up from 1,232.40; 1.2518 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2564. Gold climbed to a late price of $ 446.20 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's $ 443.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid price was $ 447, up from $ 442.50 late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 4.52 to close at a bid $ 447.79. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery eased back to $ 445.30 a troy ounce, from $ 446.30 Tuesday. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Wednesday at a bid price of $ 6.36 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $ 6.25. At the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery traded at $ 6.327 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.365.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Move Higher on Panama Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices spurted upward Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reponding to a drop in oil inventories and to turmoil in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. On other markets, copper futures moved sharply higher; cattle prices were a little higher while other livestock and meat declined; grain and soybean prices retreated. Oil traders said an unsuccessful coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> against the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> set the oil market on edge. `` And there were rumors that workers on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> oil pipeline went on strike,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. The pipeline is the primary means of moving crude oil shipped from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to other tankers that take it to <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. There also were rumors that the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> military cut off roads to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zone </LOCATION> and fears that the canal could be closed, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. `` All this helped people to make up their minds to cover'' their `` short'' positions, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. There has been an unusually large number of open contracts on crude oil, with many traders having sold contracts with the idea of buying them back later in hopes prices would fall in the interval _ a practice known as `` selling short.'' Fearing the events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could drive prices up instead, many people who were short felt it was wise to buy now to offset their earlier sales, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. The reports out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> topped a market that opened bullish on industry data released Tuesday. The American Petroleum Industry said crude oil, gasoline and heating oil stocks were all down in the latest week. Gasoline was down 3.59 million barrels from the previous week and heating oil was reduced by 5.6 million barrels. `` These are very good product drawdowns,'' said <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>. Prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 19 cents to 32 cents a barrel, with the contract for delivery in April settling at $ 16. Heating oil was .43 cent to .66 cent higher, with April at 44.08 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to .89 cent higher, with April at 45.24 cents a gallon. Copper futures rallied strongly after suffering sharp declines the previous day on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The recovery was triggered by a reversal in outlook for the size of stockpiles in the exchange warehouses. `` The inventory expectations went from the plus side to the minus side,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The expectations Wednesday, she said, was that there would be further drawdowns in stocks. Trading of precious metals, meanwhile, was quiet as the market awaited the government's report Thursday on the nation's foreign trade balance during January. Copper settled .30 cent lower to 3.05 cents higher, with the May contract at 97.55 cents a pound. Gold was $ 1 lower, with March at $ 445.30 a troy ounce; and silver was 3.8 cents to 4 cents lower, with March at $ 6.327 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures prices turned weaker on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Selling from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> put pressure on the soybean market from the start, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. This was compounded by industry data putting the amount of soybeans processed in mills during February at 3.7 million tons, substantially lower than a month earlier and the year-ago figure. The implication is that soybean processors still have large supplies of beans. <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said the corn and wheat prices were depressed by a lack of export interest. Wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower, with March at $ 2.92 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 \ cents lower, with March at $ 1.97 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher, with March at $ 1.89 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 2 \ cents to 4 cents lower, with March at $ 6.11 -LCB- a Live cattle futures rallied to close a little higher, while other livestock and meat were weaker at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Traders said a snowstorm in the Plains encouraged buying of cattle futures. Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .15 cent higher, with the April contract at 73.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .32 cent lower, with March at 82.40 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .30 cent lower, with April at 44.77 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .25 cent lower, with March at 52.50 cents a pound. Stock-index futures moved higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.80 points higher at 268.80 points. The underlying spot index gained 2.52 points, closing at 268.65.

 <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a two-year-old holding company, on Wednesday announced plans to split into two public companies and buy back 22 percent of its stock. The stock buy-back would cost about $ 512 million at current prices. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> jumped $ 1.75 a share to close at $ 25.625 a share in over-the-counter trading. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> is an amalgam of 35 construction, environmental, energy, chemcial, manufacturing and finance businesses spun off in April 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which itself was formed by a $ 5 billion merger in 1985. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> has gained a reputation for tightening operations to boost profits in individual units and then taking those units public The current market value of <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s investments in its subsidiaries that have publicly traded shares and its other long-term investment securities is $ 2 billion. In recent months <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> has been involved in a so-far unsuccessful bid for <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based railroad, land and natural resources giant. Under the restructuring, which was approved in principle by the company's board on Wednesday, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s assets would be divided between two public companies: _ <ORGANIZATION> Wheelabrator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which already is publicly traded, would take over <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION>'s stake in its successful <ORGANIZATION> Wheelabrator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and other assets related to the refuse-to-energy business <ORGANIZATION> Wheelabrator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> would have the flexibility and resources to speed up the expansion of its businesses through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures. _ A newly created entity, to be called <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would own <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s stake in <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, plus other assets `` This program will enable our shareholders to participate directly in <LOCATION> Henley </LOCATION>'s $ 650 million investment in <ORGANIZATION> Wheelabrator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's leading refuse-to-energy business,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive. Shares of the new entity that will be created for <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s other holdings will be distributed to stockholders as a partially taxable special dividend, the company said. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s board also authorized the repurchase of 20 million of the company's 90 million outstanding shares. The number of outstanding shares peaked at 129 million in November 1986 before the company initiated a series of stock buy-backs. After the buy-back is completed, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> will have repurchased nearly 43 percent of its stock. Separately, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> said it decided to waive protection under a recently enacted <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> statute providing that a holder of 15 percent of a company's stock is prohibited from merging with the company or undertaking certain other actions for three years. `` We do not believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to impose these restrictions,'' <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON> said. `` We prefer to give investors a free hand to make those decisions.'' <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s top management owns about 6.5 million of the company's shares That stake would rise to 9.3 percent with the completion of the stock repurchase. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said management was n't considering a bid to take the company private <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> also said it intends to raise $ 1 billion by issuing notes, then using the proceeds to pay off its current $ 980 million in bank debt. That will allow the company to arrange $ 2.5 billion in new bank credit, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Avis Ends Five-Year Ban on Cornrows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The car rental company <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> suddenly reversed a five-year policy forbidding employees to wear cornrows after two black workers filed a racial discrimination complaint Tuesday. In a memorandum filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, longterm employees <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 35, contended a ban against the small, tight braids injected `` racial considerations into the employment process.'' They argued the ban targeted blacks because the hair style was worn predominantly by blacks, often as an affirmation of their African heritage. Just hours after the memorandum was filed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the Avis headquarters in <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, notified the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> branch the ban had been lifted. `` I am delighted that <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> is in fact trying harder,'' <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said. `` The ... office tells me I am to inform my clients that they are free to wear their cornrows proudly to work tomorrow. This is the fastest victory I ever had in my life. I'm just delighted. My clients won.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was in the process of `` formalizing'' new standards allowing cornrows before the employees' filed their complaint. The new grooming guidelines will appear in a brochure that will be issued to <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION>' 1,400 national branches in May, he said. Cornrows were banned in a written circular in 1983 along with `` extreme'' bouffant hairdos and unkempt layered cuts. `` But things are modified, hairstyles are modified and attitudes are modified,'' <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said. `` In the'60s, we used to require women behind the counter to wear girdles, and we had rules governing hair length and facial hair. All those things have changed over time.'' When the ban was implemented, cornrows were not predominantly considered a sign of black pride, he said. `` My first awareness of cornrows was with a -LRB- white -RRB- movie actress, <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> reversed its position as part of an effort to respect cultural differences, he said. According to <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were warned that they would be fired when they began wearing cornrows in July. The rental agents wore wigs over the cornrows `` until they literally became a headache'' and then gave up the hairstyle, he said. Their memorandum charged that the ban on cornrows violated city, state and federal job discrimination laws. Had the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations concurred, the agency could have taken <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> to court, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said he will wait a few weeks to see how the women fare before withdrawing the charges.

<HEAD>FERC Says Construction Applications Involve 31 Projects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decided Wednesday that 71 applications to construct new natural gas pipelines serving the Northeast really amount to 31 projects, and the staff has warned two that they are in danger of rejection already. The analysis was necessary because a single project may require more than one request to the commission to proceed. If a new pipeline would use a segment of an existing line in the middle, it might mean three applications _ one for the middle and one for each end. The commission attracted the applications during an `` open season'' ending in January for new pipeline applications to serve <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where demand for gas is rising. As is its custom, the commission declined to release immediately the text of what it had voted on, but staff lawyer <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Court </PERSON> told reporters afterward the commission wanted public comment on its analysis and how to proceed, and would request market data from the applicants and schedule technical conferences in the next step. Chairman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> told her four fellow commissioners she would propose a schedule in the next few days. Without the text of what the commission voted, it was impossible to tell which companies fell in what class. But the commission was told in a staff briefing that of the 31 projects, 20 appear to be competitive, requiring hearings comparing one proposal against another. Court said later it was not clear yet whether all 20 would be in one hearing, or whether separate competitions were involved and the hearings could be held in groups, perhaps according to the market that would be served. Seven projects have no competition and can proceed on their own, and backers of four were sent `` deficiency letters,'' warning that their applications were inadequate. Two of those letters went to <ORGANIZATION> ANR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose Erie subsidiary has one project, and to <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose Indiana-Ohio subsidiary has another. The two companies were among three applying for permission under an optional procedure whereby the applicant assumes the economic risk of building the line and is forbidden from spreading those costs among other other lines and customers if its expectations do n't pan out. The commission, however, has limited such applications to pipelines promising to transport gas for anybody _ and has denied such applications from `` open access'' companies it judged mere extensions of a `` closed'' company. That is the case with <ORGANIZATION> ANR </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Court </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will try to meet its foreign competition by trimming executive-suite jobs and stepping up teamwork on the plant floor, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> vice president said Tuesday. By year's end, the No. 3 automaker will begin cutting its eight-level organizational chart to a six-tier plan similar to Japanese auto company structures, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, vice president of human resources and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s chief labor negotiator. The company also plans a new dispute-resolution system for management employees in addition to opening early negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union on a contract for some 60,000 union employees. Contract talks could begin as early as the third week in April, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> agreed last week to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s request for early negotiations on a contract to replace a three-year contract expiring Sept. 14. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> needs to find ways to inspire employee commitment and loyalty while keeping the company's employment costs at competitive levels. `` The outcome may well be determined by our ability to provide meaningful assurances of employee security,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said at a labor-management seminar at <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an early start of talks was part of an effort to return to a teamwork labor-management approach, he said. Talks normally begin in mid-July. Tension already is running high in response to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to close down operations in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and its plan, since reversed in the face of bitter <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> opposition, to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary `` Our goal is to reach a strike-free settlement,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` It is going to then put the adversarial action behind us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> already has begun talks with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> on a contract covering 800 employees who will continue engine assembly work at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> and a closing agreement to cover 5,500 employees losing their jobs in assembly and stamping operations at the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> factory. In addition to the contract talks, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said, the company will be attempting to negotiate additional modern operating agreements such as those set up in six of its plants since 1985. The agreements involve a teamwork concept, also found in Japanese auto plants, involving workers in decisions, cutting the number of supervisors by about 30 percent, and eliminating artificial barriers such as separate management dining rooms and parking. `` It puts into practice the simple but long neglected truth that people exist from their shoulders up as well as from their shoulders down,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. The 1985 contract established a six-member joint activities board with three members each from the company and union. The board has organized training to bring employees up to date in areas such as computers, new technology, robotics. Training programs will be stepped up, along with such modern operating agreement features such as higher pay for workers mastering additional skills. `` Roughly 25 percent of our hourly work force is illiterate,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> did not say how many jobs would be involved in the upper-level cuts, but said most are expected to be accomplished through retirements and other normal departures.

<HEAD>Housing and Production Up, Markets Quiet Ahead of Trade Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Stronger industrial production and a rebound in housing construction were reported by the government Wednesday, but the financial markets had mixed reactions in advance of a more potent statistic, the trade deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production edged up 0.2 percent in February despite output reductions at auto factories and coal mines. Economists said the gain, although slower than the January level, represented good news for the economy and further dampened concerns about a severe slowdown. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the housing industry, after staggering for two months following the October stock crash, enjoyed a sharp 8.9 percent increase in construction activity in February, the biggest gain in more than a year. The department said the increase pushed construction of single-family homes and apartments up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units last month following declines of 15.8 percent in December and 1.9 percent in January. Those setbacks, coupled with three consecutive monthly declines in new home sales, had raised concerns because housing is often the first industry to weaken at the onset of a recession. Economists feared that home buyers had grown wary following the record collapse of the stock market in October. But the February upturn in construction starts was seen as an encouraging sign that while housing activity will be slower this year, it will not weaken so much that it threatens overall economic growth. `` Housing is on the rebound,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` With interest rates at low levels and the economy growing and no recession in sight, we think we have all the ingredients in place to generate a strong spring building season.'' Nevertheless, the news hurt the bond market, a barometer of interest rates and the economy. Since stronger growth implies future inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments, bond prices tumbled. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year issue fell $ 10 per $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, jumped from 8.51 percent to 8.60 percent, its highest level since late January. On the other hand, the stock market closed largely higher. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which sat for most of the day with a modest loss, ended with a 16.91 point gain at 2,064.32, though trading was slow. Analysts said the markets remained preoccupied with what the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would report Thursday on the January trade deficit. That monthly statistic has become one of the most important influences because of its implications for American monetary and trade policy. The deficit declined in November and December, suggesting that the dollar's depreciation over the past two years has made <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products more competitive. Three straight monthly declines would provide further confirmation of that trend and lessen pressure for more devaluation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Conversely, if the deficit significantly widened in January, the dollar likely would fall, raising fears of inflation and foreign flight from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to let some <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> school districts continue to use 17-year-old bus drivers through the end of the school year. The agreement supersedes a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> order that had required both states to end the use of 17-year-old school bus drivers by April 1. The department had told the two states it was ending an exemption allowing the 17-year-old drivers because the states had violated the terms of the exemption, primarily by using drivers who had moving violations. Officials in both states had protested that some districts had been unable to find qualified replacements, and that abruptly replacing experienced 17-year-olds with new drivers could create safety problems. Under the agreement announced by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, school districts that have had the most problems finding new drivers can use 17-year-old drivers through June 15, and all districts may use drivers who will turn 18 before that time. All 17-year-old drivers must have been hired and trained before the school year began and must have clean driving records, the agreement said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> called the compromise a `` fair agreement.'' `` This agreement was essential to provide the safest possible situation for our children for the remainder of the school year, as well as prevent major disruptions in the 12 districts unable to find qualified adults,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` The state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> will not seek another extension,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` We will have an all-adult force in place by the beginning of the next school year.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and state Education Superintendent <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said they support state budget proposals that would raise minimum bus driver pay from $ 3.47 to $ 4.75 an hour and fund some fringe benefits. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he would seek a $ 24 million budget amendment during the June session of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to increase drivers' pay to enable the state to attract and hire additional adult drivers. The state has 2,085 drivers under age 18, officials said. `` During our discussions with Secretary <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, I think it became apparent that our school children would be a lot safer riding with 17-year-olds with seven or eight months of bus driving experience than it would be to have them riding with drivers who have little or no experience driving a school bus,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the agreement leaves <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with about 350 adult positions to fill by next year. After beginning the year with 2,250 17-year-old drivers, the state now has 808 17-year-olds among its 6,000 drivers, Deputy Superintendent of Education <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Garris </PERSON> said. The 17-year-olds have been permitted to drive in the two states under an exemption to the Fair Labor Standards Act. But that was repealed after <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations during January and February found <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> had violated the act 80 times, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> had recorded 200 violations during the two-month period. The investigation was triggered when a 4-year-old boy in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was struck and killed by a 17-year-old bus driver with a bad driving record.

 A federal judge Wednesday blocked a moved by an Italian tire maker to stop an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law from hampering its attempted takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> ruled that the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Control Share Acquisition Act does not violate federal law by discriminating against interstate commerce, or causing inconsistent state regulation The statute requires a corporate raider to wait up to 50 days for shareholders to vote before purchasing tendered shares. Federal law requires that any tender offer remain open for no less than 20 business days. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> made a tender offer of $ 58 a share last week for <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>, which has its corporate offices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tire headquarters in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. The $ 1.9 billion offer is contingent on Firestone dropping its plans to enter into a joint tire venture with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Firestone officials said <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s offer killed earlier plans to sell most of the <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> tire-making business to <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, but the Firestone board met Monday and decided to explore other options. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said it is again talking with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, adding that the talks concern `` what course of action <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> may now wish to pursue.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tire maker said it would advise shareholders by Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> offer. Firestone attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarton </PERSON> opposed <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to win a preliminary injunction during a court hearing Monday, saying `` Control is one of the most valuable assets a shareholder can possess. It is a collective asset and should be -LRB- given up -RRB- in a collective manner.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, an attorney representing Pirelli-owned <ORGANIZATION> Veere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, argued the law is a burden on interstate commerce and could hurt shareholders by giving <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> time to defeat <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer. Ms. <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said it is possible for companies to comply with both <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and federal law. `` The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> act ... by allowing the shareholders collectively to evaluate the fairness of the tender offer and to vote as a group, ... furthers the policy of investor protection,'' Ms. <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> wrote, in a 14-page opinion. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce or cause inconsistent state regulation because it has the same effects on raiders from inside and outside of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, she said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was studying a cash payout to shareholders, asset sales or a recapitalization plan to battle a takeover attempt by a British investor and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment bank. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> did not disclose the options it was studying, but investor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, who has joined with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in making the $ 45 a share, or $ 1.3 billion, takeover offer, criticized the company's disclosure. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> decided to undertake a recapitalization, the case the company essentially was bidding for itself. As such, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> was obligated to give <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s group access to the same confidential corporate information <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> would use to formulate such a plan. `` You now have a duty to provide us with a ` level playing field,' to meet with us, and to furnish us with the same information you would provide to potential lenders or investors in any recapitalization or asset sale program that <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> is considering,'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said in a public letter issued Wednesday. In addition to disclosing possible alternatives to thwart <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> likely will launch a publicity campaign criticizing <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, according to one securities analyst. `` I would expect the first thing you'll see ... will be some newspaper advertising that'll peel the hide off <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cyrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> is vulnerable to criticism for owning 46 percent of <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company formed with <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> to attempt the takeover of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> building materials and chemical company. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s equity participation is a more aggressive variation of investment bankers' traditional role as adviser and financier in hostile takeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> alleged in a federal lawsuit filed March 11 that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> violated disclosure requirements of securities laws and that it offered to sell <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> its services defending the company against hostile takeovers after laying plans with <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> to raid the company. <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> filed suit in federal court Wednesday alleging that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, as underwriter of city bonds, violated its duty not to do anything to hurt the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> economy, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>, spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>. Under <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to sell <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemical business, about 1,100 jobs could disappear in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, city officials contend. <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> also ordered city department heads to exclude <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> from consideration as an underwriter of future financing, <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the board set no timetable for settling details of any recapitalization offer. `` The question is what's it worth'' to shareholders, said securities analyst <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Drahuschak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Singer of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` Until that happens you wait around. <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON> said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> to defeat the tender offer through the lawsuit and an offer to common shareholders of cash and securities worth up to $ 60. `` I do n't see a third party out there that would be a competitor to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Drahuschak </PERSON>. `` I tried to find one and could n't even scare up a good rumor. <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>, however, said aggregates, the crushed stone used in roadbeds and mixed with cement to make concrete, are tightly controlled in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, enhancing interest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers like <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. The weak <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and accounting rule differences in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might also attract other bidders for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' board believes that the company remaining independent would, over the long term, be a superior alternative to accepting the BNS offer,'' which is inadequate, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> common stock jumped $ 2.75 a share Tuesday to $ 54.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, apparently in anticipation of Wednesday's deadline for the company to respond to the tender offer. The announcement sent the stock down 87 -LCB- cents to $ 53.62 -LCB- Wednesday in heavy trading. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said management will explore the possible sale of an equity interest in all or part of the construction materials and services business or portions of the business and the proceeds used to sweeten the payments to common shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> has said it probably would sell <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemicals business if it gained control. The BNS offer of $ 107 for each preferred share is adequate, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said, while declining to advise holders whether to tender their stock. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said it is being advised by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.
