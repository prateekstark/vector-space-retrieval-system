 Inmates took over a prison farm Sunday and seized guards and visitors as hostages, news broadcasts said, with as many as five people killed and up to 20 injured. Television station <PERSON> Notisiete </PERSON> said Easter was a visiting day and about 250 prisoners were holding an estimated 400 people hostage, including guards, other inmates and visiting families with children. Notisiete broadcast reports, which were not confirmed by officials, said three guards and two inmates were killed. A private radio station, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, reported that at least two guards and two inmates were killed and 20 people were injured. Neither report gave any indication of the cause of the uprising at the <LOCATION> Pavon </LOCATION> prison farm 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The takeover began early Sunday afternoon and continued into the night, local television and radio stations reported. Witnesses said firefighters and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers were seen entering the prison with five stretchers. Prison officials and the national police refused to comment on the situation. Television newscasts showed the prison farm surrounded by police and soldiers sent from the capital. An air force helicopter hovered overhead. <PERSON> Notisiete </PERSON> said additional army units were on standby. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> broadcast an interview with a man identified as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> who said he and his wife <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> were waiting outside to visit a family member when the revolt began. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> told the radio station his wife was among about 20 people who were wounded in a gunfight between inmates and guards. He said his wife was taken to a police hospital and he did not know the extent of her injuries. He said he took his wounded wife into a nearby prison chapel where many other visitors sought refuge and where other injured were being cared for. Reports said officials tried to bargain with prisoners to get them to surrender rifles they grabbed from prison guards, and then most of the weapons were recovered after a gun battle. The reports said negotiations were continuing. Notisiete quoted Fire Department Cmdr. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Giammattei </PERSON> <PERSON> Falla </PERSON> as saying the inmates demanded to talk with federal human rights director <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Riva </PERSON> and that journalists and medical workers be allowed to enter the prison.

 The sweeping esplanade and the giant granite cross thrusting up from the surrounding mountains dwarf the schoolgirls and conscripts on an outing at the Valley of the Fallen. The visitors giggle, shout and strut. They appear oblivious to the presence in the crypt behind them of the bones of 40,000 people who died fighting on both sides in the Spanish Civil War, which ended 50 years ago on April 1, 1939. Neither the monument _ built by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> prisoners-of-war defeated by the forces of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> _ nor the memory of the three-year war itself seem to weigh very heaviliy on the spirit of a modern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The government of Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has planned no public observance for April 1, the day a half-century ago that ushered in a 36-year <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> dictatorship that outlawed the Socialist and all other political parties. Socialists, Communists, liberals, anarchists, Masons and free-thinkers all suffered in the harsh repression that followed <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s victory, which marked the end of his July 1936 uprising against the forces of the Second Spanish Republic. Many who fought on the side of the Republic perished from hunger and ill treatment while hacking away at the granite mountains to build the Valley of the Fallen, 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. `` The Socialists try to distinguish themselves from the Francoists by not keeping alive the memory of the Civil War,'' British historian <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> explained. `` There's nothing good to remember. It was n't really the end, it was the beginning of very difficult times for many, many people.'' A member of the Friends of Former Spanish Refugees said the government had agreed to help with their project to have as many indigent, elderly exiles as possible return to visit <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> this year _ as long as no mention was made of the end of the Civil War that drove them away in the first place. <PERSON> Jordi </PERSON> <PERSON> Corral </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, a 21-year-old corporal in the army's elite Brunete armored division, knows that <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> lies buried beneath a plain, marble slab in the basilica, but he says he could care less about the man whose crusade for a righteous, rightist <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was falling apart by the time the young conscript was born. The Valley of the Fallen _ which <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> designed as his final resting place _ has been administered since 1982 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrimony </ORGANIZATION> in hopes, according to some, that it will gradually lose its fascist connotations and slip into the vast collection of old castles and monuments that dot the Spanish landscape. Historian <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Tusell </PERSON> and Culture Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Semprun </PERSON> are both concerned about Spaniards' reluctance to confront their past and their lack of historical memory. On the eve of the 50th anniversary and 14 years after <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s death, `` it is striking that our country, which has gone through a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy, has not, however, developed a shared historic conscience,'' <PERSON> Tusell </PERSON> wrote recently in a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> newspaper `` It's not a banal issue,'' he continued, `` because the image that a group projects of itself on the past indicates its willingness to live in harmony in the present and the future.'' <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> remembers the day 50 years ago when he and a group of other 12-year-olds joined the crowds in downtown <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> that hurried to put out the appropriate flags as the remaining Republican troops fled and <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s victorious Nationalist forces approached the Spanish capital. `` We rushed into a barracks the ` Reds' had abandoned and stuffed our pockets with potatoes and carrots,'' he recalled. `` Hunger was everywhere in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> during the war, and we were happy it was over.'' `` The war did n't really end in 1939, the hardships and conditions of war continued well into the late 1940s,'' said sociologist <PERSON> Amando </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>. `` People did n't marry very much, a great sense of depression set in, there was a terrible shortage of food, and then, the guerrilla warfare against <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> went on into the 1950s.'' <PERSON> Semprun </PERSON>, who wrote the screenplay for <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Renais </PERSON>' 1964 film, `` La guerre est finie'' -LRB- The War is Over -RRB- as a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, warned attendants at recent academic conference that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> will be in trouble without a historical memory. To fill the gap, many of the country's leading newspapers plan special supplements dealing with the end of the war and its relevance today. And a surprising success of the current literary season has been a novel entitled `` Luna de Lobos'' -LRB- Wolves' Moon -RRB-, by 31-year-old poet <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Llanzamares </PERSON>, the sparse tale of three men in the anti-Franco guerrilla movement who try to get to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> through the mountains of northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The late Spanish historian <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Albornoz </PERSON>, who exhorted his countrymen not to forget the Civil War, wrote that during the 1931-39 Second Republic, Spaniards tried to carry out religious, political and economic revolutions that their European neighbors had taken centuries to realize. French historian <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilar </PERSON> says it will be possible to date the real end of the Spanish Civil War to the time when the three revolutions have been carried out.

<TEXT>
 Laotians voted to elect their ruling national council for the first time Sunday in polling that some foreign analysts described as a public relations exercise by Communist leaders. A senior <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> official said no major changes will be made in the Communist autocracy that has governed the country for 13 years. Hundreds were already lined up at polling places at schools, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples and government offices in this capital city when the polls opened in the morning. The 1.8 million eligible voters of this impoverished Southeast Asian nation of 3.8 million people were electing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the highest state body. Officials said 121 candidates, mostly <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, are running for 79 seats on the body. The council was established when the Communists seized power in December 1975. Some foreign analysts said the election is intended to convince the world <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> was stable and an attractive country for foreign investment, trade and foreign aid. In an interview last week, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> political scientist <PERSON> Sirichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirikai </PERSON> said the election is designed only to consolidate the power of the Communist hierarchy and convince the world of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' political stability As he arrived at a temple to cast his ballot, <PERSON> Sisomphon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavansay </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was asked by journalists about reports of major government changes following the election. `` There will be no changes,'' he replied, adding that the council will not select a new premier. <PERSON> Sisomphon </PERSON> refused to reply when asked if he would be retiring. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> media had quoted reports that some elderly officials may retire after the election, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> <PERSON> Phomvihane </PERSON>, 68; acting President <PERSON> Phoumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vongvichit </PERSON>, 80; and <PERSON> Sisomphon </PERSON>, 72. However, <PERSON> Somsavath </PERSON> <PERSON> Lengsavad </PERSON>, permanent secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had called the election `` another step toward socialist democracy.'' He said results from the country's 4,153 polling stations would be counted by hand, and the final tally would not be known for a week to 10 days. The first nationwide district and provincial elections were held last year.

 Millions of Soviets filled out ballots providing a choice of candidates for the first time Sunday in parliamentary elections that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called a triumph for his vision of democracy. However, maverick candidate <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, running to represent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, claimed many people are worried about the possibility of vote fraud and ballot-box stuffing. He complained that the elections were n't completely democratic <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> polling stations, brightly lit and festooned with red banners and Soviet flags, opened at 7 a.m. Observers reported light voter turnout in the morning, but the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said more people were heading for the polls later in the morning. Voters will elect 1,500 deputies of the new 2,250-member congress, which later will choose the country's president and elect from its own ranks delegates to a new full-time Supreme Soviet legislature. The congress itself will meet once a year. Official public organizations, ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a national association for book lovers, are directly electing 750 delegates to the new assembly. In Sunday's voting, hundreds of races were being contested for the first time in 70 years, a major change in Soviet politics. In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has allowed only one approved candidate to run for each seat. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who voted with his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> at a polling station at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters afterward the sometimes boisterous campaign was just what the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership wanted. `` The electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It has advanced the political thought and social activity of the people, and this is what we wanted to achieve.'' While it was still Saturday evening in the capital, voters in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> began casting ballots in voting stations 11 time zones away. Aboard the orbiting Mir space station, cosmonauts <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> were also among the first to vote, radioing their choice to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet voting age is 18, and about 190 million of the 285 million Soviets are eligible to vote, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Voting is not mandatory and ballots are secret, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Nearly 180,000 polling stations nationwide opened Sunday morning and will close at 8 p.m. local time. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the first election results are expected Sunday night, but full returns will not be known for about 10 days.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> proclaimed an Easter Sunday message of hope tinged with sadness, recalling those persecuted for their faith, the breakup of families, and sectarian strife. About 100,000 pilgrims, tourists and Romans jammed into Saint <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s square to hear the pope say mid-morning Easter Mass on the steps of Christianity's largest basilica. He later moved to the balcony to deliver his speech and Easter greetings in 55 languages. By then, the crowd had nearly doubled, spilling over into narrow and cobblestone streets surrounding <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Keeping with Easter tradition, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, who is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and titular bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, delivered his Easter message `` Urbi et Orbi,'' Latin meaning `` to the city and the world.'' On Easter, Christians celebrate their belief in the resurrection of Christ from his tomb following his death on the cross on Good Friday. Calling Easter `` the new Passover,'' in reference to the night the Jews were miraculously saved in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said: `` God continues to pass -LRB- through the world -RRB- through the resurrection of his son, the son of man ...'' `` God passes and frees from the fear that oppresses so many of our brothers and sisters,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` He passes where there do not exist conditions worthy of a truly human life,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> added.

He did not name any country. `` God passes where ... the longed-for peace is not yet to be seen,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, singling out sectarian strife in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` God still passes and sets free the whole of creation ... In his blood all is reconciled: man with God, with himself, with nature,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` At this point, the responsibility of man gains new strength and awareness ... `` This is the truth which Easter proclaims to today's world, which is so many ways seems to be rushing headlong towards self-destruction and death,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>It's Crunch Time For Brady Third World Debt Relief Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's heralded plan to relieve the staggering Third World debt burden faces its first big test this week when <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> tries to sell the proposal to finance ministers from around the world. The sales talk will come at the spring meeting of the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the two major lending organizations, and at a separate strategy session attended by officials from the seven largest industrial countries. The sessions should be lively. Already, the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan is being viewed as a crucial watershed for the 7-year debt crisis, which has at various times threatened financial calamity for major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and turned <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into a political time bomb as struggling democracies in the region tried to cope with growing debt repayments. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, as the new initiative is being called, seeks to encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of the $ 1.3 trillion in debt owed by poor countries in return for guarantees backed by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that the remaining pool of debt will be repaid. The new administration received high marks for abandoning what many considered to be the failed policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which repeatedly refused to endorse any broad-scale effort at debt forgiveness. But critics, including many of the largest debtor countries, complain that the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> proposal does not go far enough, especially in view of the economic and political pressures building in much of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> last month left more than 300 people dead after the government announced a new austerity program implemented to please the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and other creditors who hold $ 33 billion of that country's debt. The administration is hoping to come out of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> session with a general endorsement of the principles of the new debt approach when the meetings wrap up on April 4. But many of the debtor countries are pushing for quick debt relief to accompany the rhetoric. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> has termed the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> proposals `` very timid'' and officials in that country are already saying they may have to defer debt repayments if they do n't get help soon. Similar warnings have come from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Some observers say that the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, while attempting to resolve the debt crisis, may initially lead to a greater period of instability as debtors balk at meeting obligations on their old debt while they wait to see the details of the debt relief packages. Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who played a leading role in the initial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to the debt crisis in 1982, has warned that debt reduction could end up hurting both creditor and debtor countries if not properly managed. Most observers believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must come up with concrete results quickly, at least with new initiatives for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, or risk more turmoil because of dashed expectations. `` It is important that debtor nations not get their expectations too high. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> proposal represents measured improvement, not radical relief,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, the key architect of the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, says the administration's goal is to reduce the total debt burden of 39 heavily indebted countries by 20 percent over a three-year period with a similar 20 percent reduction in interest payments. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> believes that commercial banks can be enticed into writing off a portion of their Third World loans by getting the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to earmark an unspecified amount of funds to essentially guarantee the payments on the remaining level of debt. Officials of the lending organizations, while generally supportive of the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> proposals, said they need to see details on just how much money they will be expected to put up. In addition to trying to line up support with the two major lending organizations, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> faces the task of selling his proposals to officials of the world's largest industrial countries. Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the so-called Group of Seven, composed of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, will hold daylong discussions which are expected to focus on the debt plan. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> used a similar get-acquainted session in February to sound out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to the debt proposal the administration was crafting. Based on initial comments, many observers expect the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will win at least general agreement from the debtor and creditor countries and officials at the world lending organizations that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals are worth pursuing. `` The less-developed countries are now expecting something to be done and that means something has to be done,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, consulting firm. `` <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has clearly signalled the direction in which things will move.''

<HEAD>Rejection Of Begin Play Highlights Ambivalence Toward Leader</HEAD>

 In a new play about <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, the enigmatic former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader fantasizes about bombing <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to retaliate for the Holocaust and imagines being mobbed by admirers after ending his self-imposed seclusion. The one-man play was written for the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Festival in May but was rejected by festival officials who feared such free-wheeling treatment of the 75-year-old Begin was too controversial. The rejection highlights the ambivalence and strong emotions Begin still generates among Israelis nearly six years after he unexpectedly resigned as prime minister and shut himself in his two-story apartment at the edge of the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> pine forest. `` To the nationalists, Begin is a sacred man, a symbol of everything that is pure and good. To those on the left, he stands for everything they despise,'' said <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinzak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and expert on right-wing Israeli politics. Begin became prime minister in 1977, the first from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc to hold the post. Two years later, he signed the historic peace treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, sharing the Nobel Peace Prize with President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. He resigned in 1983 at the height of the war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Today, Begin's life is shrouded in mystery, frustrating biographers and heightening curiosity among Israelis. He ventures outside his apartment for a public appearance only once a year to attend a memorial service for his wife, <PERSON> Aliza </PERSON>, who died in 1982. Begin breaks his silence rarely, usually to comment briefly on the radio about history. He refuses to discuss his resignation, commonly attributed to depression over the death of his wife and the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war, in which more than 600 Israelis died. On Sunday, Begin commented on the 10th anniversary of the Israel-Egypt peace accord, taking the unusual step of speaking about current politics and criticizing the new American dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as `` a negative, harmful phenomenon.'' He spends his days reading books, mostly biographies and history, said longtime Begin aide <PERSON> Yehiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadishai </PERSON>. He said Begin keeps up with news programs, reads <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and foreign newspapers, and answers several dozen letters a week. Once an avid movie-goer, he now watches videos in the evenings. `` He likes Westerns,'' said <PERSON> Kadishai </PERSON>, adding that the former prime minister also used to watch the American soap opera `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' American oil magnate <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> offered to donate $ 750,000 to Begin's favorite charity if the former prime minister wrote his autobiography, but <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> has declined, <PERSON> Kadishai </PERSON> said. His family, aides and friends refuse to talk about Begin in what <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists have described as a wall of silence. Justice Minister <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON>, a longtime friend, visits Begin every Friday to talk politics. When asked for details about the talks, <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> balked. `` I've never spoken about my conversations with Begin.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dankner </PERSON> tried to skirt these obstacles and probe the former prime minister's psyche in his one-man play, titled simply `` Begin.'' In one scene, <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> imagines ending his seclusion. `` People will see me and will be amazed,'' he says, dreaming of a crowd cheering and shouting `` long live Begin.'' But then he stops himself and asks: `` What would be the point of all those years? All the silence, the self-imprisonment?'' In another scene, Begin fantasizes about ordering a strike against <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in retaliation for the Nazi Holocaust in which 6 million Jews, including Begin's parents and brother, were killed. `` On that day, bodies would pile up at the entrances of towns and squares, like they were piled up at the entrances of the camps,'' says the Begin character. <PERSON> Dankner </PERSON> said he and many other Israelis share these revenge fantasies, adding that Begin's ability to articulate such emotions was at the root of his popularity. `` In every Israeli, there is a little Begin,'' he said. `` He expressed our fears, our nightmares, our delusions of grandeur.'' Even today, the mention of Begin sparks strong reactions. During an election rally last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> followers listened politely to speeches by party leaders, but at the mention of Begin's name worked themselves into a frenzy, clapping and shouting the name of the former leader for several minutes. But anger toward Begin has remained just as strong. While Begin celebrated his birthday last summer, a crowd gathered outside his apartment, including a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> woman whose son was killed in the June 1982 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> invasion. `` This man caused dozens of young men not to reach even their 20th birthdays,'' said the woman, <PERSON> Raya </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnik </PERSON>. `` In the middle of the war he just said he could n't go on any longer. The bereaved parents never had such a privilege.''

<HEAD>Time Flies When You're Having Fun Doing Your Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a five-year, $ 1.9 million study, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that the average taxpayer should be able to fill out Form 1040, the dreaded individual income tax return, in exactly 3 hours and 7 minutes. But if it's past midnight, and you're lost in a thicket of deductions, exemptions, credits, exclusions and exceptions, you've got a splitting headache, the clock is ticking away and you're getting angrier by the minute, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would like to hear your This year, for the first time, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> instructions for more than 350 tax forms includes an estimate of how long it takes to complete each one. Time estimates also appear on the thousands upon thousands of forms required by every other federal agency _ all under a new rule issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> to implement the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The notices also include the name and address of an official to contact if someone wants to complain about a form or dispute a time estimate. The idea is that if enough people complain, bureaucrats will feel pressured to simplify the forms _ or perhaps to shorten some or eliminate them altogether _ in the interest of easing the burden of government paperwork. Altogether, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says, the total time the average taxpayer should spend on Form 1040 is 9 hours and 17 minutes. That includes 3 hours and 7 minutes of record keeping, 2 hours and 28 minutes to learn about the form, 3 hours and 7 minutes to actually fill it out and 35 minutes to assemble the documents, copy them and send them to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. If the taxpayer itemizes deductions, add 4 hours and 34 minutes for completing Schedule A, which lists deductions. That makes a total of 13 hours and 51 minutes. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> man with the stopwatch was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Iocozzia </PERSON>, a statistical researcher who helped develop the computerized time-motion study conducted by a private management consultant, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The exhaustive study, which began in 1983 and ended last summer, included sending 10-page questionnaires to 6,200 individuals and more than 4,000 businesses and tax preparers. A separate group of 750 taxpayers kept yearlong diaries recording the time they spent on all tax-related activities, such as tossing receipts into a shoebox. When he figured his personal taxes recently, <PERSON> Iocozzia </PERSON> said, `` I kept track of my time spent, and I came pretty close to what is listed here.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> rule is the brainchild of <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Transeau </PERSON>, chief paperwork manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, who estimates that Americans probably spend 12.7 billion hours a year filling out forms for the federal government. If their time is worth, say, $ 10 an hour, that means a $ 127 billion annual loss to the national economy, <PERSON> Transeau </PERSON> says. It's such a staggering task, he said, that the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces _ all 2.2 million men and women on active duty _ could be kept busy all year doing nothing else but completing government forms. And they'd need an additional half-million people to finish the job. This bothered <PERSON> Transeau </PERSON> enough to call a meeting of fellow paperwork managers in other agencies to talk about it. When he suggested printing time estimates on every form, he recalled, the room fell silent. Then the bickering began. Someone protested that blank spaces on the forms would be eaten up. `` You mean to tell me that we do n't want to change federal forms to preserve doodling space for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people?'' <PERSON> Transeau </PERSON> responded. `` If we do this, people will write in and complain,'' a fellow bureaucrat said. `` Then we'll have to change the damned forms.'' `` That's the idea!'' <PERSON> Transeau </PERSON> replied. He said the new <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> rule, which he championed over the strenuous objections of most federal agencies, already has had `` an enormous impact'' in solving a problem that he believes shackles <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitive strength in world markets `` Before anything happens in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, you've got to get to the true magnitude of the problem,'' <PERSON> Transeau </PERSON> said. `` We now know that the paperwork burden is far greater than we reported before.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has boosted sevenfold its previous estimates of how long it takes taxpayers to complete its forms. -LRB- <PERSON> Iocozzia </PERSON> says that's because the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> formerly ignored such activities as record keeping, which consumes 50 percent of a taxpayer's time. -RRB- <PERSON> Transeau </PERSON> is still struggling to finish his own tax return before the April 17 deadline. He laughs ruefully at the new <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> time estimates. `` It's taking so long, I need professional help,'' he said. `` I ca n't get through it. There's no way I'm going to finish in that amount of time.''

<HEAD>Hunger Striker Suspends Fast After 37 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A detainee in critical condition after 37 days on a hunger strike said Sunday he would suspend his fast and hinted he may soon be released. In a separate development, Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told residents of an impoverished township that black faction fighting remains an obstacle in their struggle for political rights. Hunger striker <PERSON> Sandile </PERSON> <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, who has been fasting to protest his detention without trial, said he decided to resume eating following a Saturday meeting with anti-apartheid leader Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> also spoke Saturday to Minister of Law and <PERSON> Order </PERSON> <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> about <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, who has staged the longest fast of the estimated 600 detainees who have participated in a hunger strike since January to demand their freedom. <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> said the negotiations between <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> were the key to his decision to resume eating. His comment suggested there has been some progress toward his release, but he would not say if the government had given him any assurances that he will be freed. The government has said it would not consider <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>'s release until he resumed eating. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he will meet <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> this week for additional talks on the status of Thusi and other detainees. <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, who is in the intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aidan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, said in a statement he would begin eating Monday after meeting with his family. The 26-year-old university researcher reportedly has lost 57 pounds, or about one-third of his weight, during his fast to protest his nine-month detention without trial. Doctors have described his condition as critical and said he risks blindness and brain damage if he continues to fast. The government says it has authorized the release of 580 people in custody since the hunger strike began. Human rights groups say several hundred activists remain held without charge. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths of time during the 33-month-old state of emergency. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> delivered his Easter Sunday sermon to 600 people, including dozens of uniformed policemen, at an Anglican Church service in <LOCATION> Mbekweni </LOCATION>, a township about 45 miles east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt that it is God's intention for us -LRB- blacks -RRB- to be free in our land,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. `` For we do not want to oppress anyone, we just want to live in peace and harmony and happiness.'' Several hundred township residents, including a band and drum majorettes, sang and danced while they waited for the arrival of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I pray that we in this township will know that we are oppresed because we are black,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. `` Therefore, we will be united and not allow ourselves to be divided into warring factions. The day we are so united there will be nothing to stop us.'' There have been numerous black-on-black faction fights in recent years, including 1986 battles in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> between anti-apartheid activists and pro-government vigilantes. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A dispute over cooking oils is heating up as farm state lawmakers and consumer groups join ranks on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in what they say is literally a fight for the hearts of Americans. But underlying it all is a battle that has gone on for months between agricultural producers. The fight matches <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean farmers against foreign palm and coconut growers. `` It's a symptom of increased international competition that we have today for all products,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuwee </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. So far, the dispute has produced legislation as well as a war of words in advertisements by both sides. At issue in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a proposal by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., and Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, to require more nutritional information on food packages to help consumers know what vegetable oils are used in products and how much cholesterol-raising saturated fats they contain At issue for producers is their share of the multi-billion-dollar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and international markets for edible oils, which covers everything from salad dressings, cooking oils to margarine. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, soybean oil accounts for more 70 percent of the edible oils used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while the so-called tropical oils _ palm, <LOCATION> palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> kernel </LOCATION> and coconut oils _ represent 4 percent. But internationally, tropical oils dominate and the industry worries that worldwide sales could suffer if the current health scare moves overseas from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm group, by its own admission, helped start the fight by persuading lawmakers to introduce legislation in 1987 targeting tropical oils as sources of cholesterol-raising saturated fats. `` We'd be lying if we said we have n't taken advantage of the health issue here to market our crop,'' says <PERSON> Reuwee </PERSON>. `` But it's what any good marketing organization does. Palm growers from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the leading producer of the oil, are striking back with a campaign to promote their product. `` We think we're getting a pretty bum rap from statements that palm oil raises cholesterol when there is n't any evidence whatsoever that this is true,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Malaysian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The latest development came this month when <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> introduced a new version of the legislation. The lawmakers complained that some products claim to have `` no cholesterol'' or are made with `` 100 percent vegetable shortening'' although they contain cooking oils with high levels of saturated fats. The American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which supports the legislation, says consumers can reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering the amount of saturated fat in their diet. Lard is 41 percent saturated fat by weight. Palm oil contains 51 percent saturated fat; coconut oil, 92 percent; sunflower oil, 11 percent; corn oil, 13 percent; olive oil, 14 percent; and soybean oil, 15 percent. In general, the legislation would require food labels to clearly list all cooking oils contained in the product or disclose detailed nutrition information, including the amount of total fat, cholesterol and saturated fat. The previous bill would have required labels to identify tropical oils as a `` saturated fat.'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> dropped that provision in an effort to avoid continued opposition from tropical oils producers, who blocked the original bill by arguing it represented an international trade barrier. However, <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON> contends the new legislation still will hurt tropical oil producers. `` It is safe to say that it does not really help their predicament. Forcing a food company to put palm oil, coconut or palm kernel oil down as a sole source oil probably would be somewhat of a deterrent for food companies,'' says <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON>. He contends that negative publicity already has hurt the industry. In fact, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, led by a millionaire from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, is conducting a national advertising campaign against tropical oils using banner headlines of `` The Poisoning of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Already nearly a dozen large food companies such as General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> have announced they have stopped or are phasing out the use of tropical oils from their products. Some products now carry labels that say they contain no palm or coconut oils. Palm growers have countered with full-page ads of their own in some of the nation's largest newspapers, decrying the `` smear campaign'' against tropical oils. The industry also has commissioned 30 scientific studies, including several at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities, on the health effects of palm oil. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> opposed labeling legislation, saying tropical oils contribute less than 8 percent of saturated fat intake by American consumers. In contrast, 70-75 percent of saturated fats in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diets come from consumption of meats, poultry, milk, cheese, butter and eggs.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said on Sunday the parliamentary election, which offered Soviets a choice of candidates in many cases, can ensure democracy while preserving the one-party rule of the communists. The Soviet president spoke after he and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> voted at a gold-and-white building in the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> area that houses the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associatedion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemists </ORGANIZATION> and part of the <ORGANIZATION> Semyonov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>. They chose between <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a popular maverick who <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party chief, and <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, the director of the giant ZIL automobile factory, for a seat representing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. For a second seat, representing their <LOCATION> Oktyabr </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, they chose between two relatively young and lesser-known candidates: <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavsky </PERSON>, a 28-year-old scientific worker at the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Krutov </PERSON>, a Soviet televison commentator. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would n't say for whom he voted in either case. He told Soviet and foreign correspondents gathered in a cold mist on the steps of the building that he voted `` for a candidate who was nominated.'' `` This is a secret ballot,'' he reminded them. The president said his policies of pressing for more democracy and openness in Soviet society, while not permitting any legal opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, are `` the key to opening the potential of our socialist society, with the purpose of taking into account the various interests of people and harmonizing them on the basis of consensus or a majority.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said political pluralism is `` not a panacea for solving problems and expressing a plurality of opinions.'' Despite calls by some protesters for a multiparty system, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was confident most Soviets supported his views. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has launched an investigation into charges that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> advocates a multiparty system, which is not permitted under the law. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the election law approved in December, saying it `` advanced the political thought and social activity of people.'' Officials knew when they wrote the law that it would need perfecting and that the experience of the three-month campaign would help them make corrections, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. But he did not say what changes he would support. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was not a candidate in Sunday's balloting, having already been elected to the new parliament on March 14 as one of 100 deputies picked directly by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Voters elected 1,500 deputies Sunday to represent various geographic districts throughout the country. For the first time in decades, Soviets had a choice of candidates for many of the seats. The other 650 were being chosen from the party, its affiliates, social, professional and trade union organizations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he supported competition at all levels of the election campaign but saw no contradiction in the party's nominating only 100 candidates for 100 seats He said many more candidates' names were considered before the nominations were announced.

<TEXT>
 Legislators who passed the nation's first law requiring instant background checks on people wanting to buy certain guns say they hope to end <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s reputation as a supplier of firearms to drug dealers. The deadline for signing the bill is midnight Monday; Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> has said he supports the measure and is expected to sign it. It would take effect Nov. 1. Debate on the bill saw weapons drawn in the halls of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The sponsor of the measure took a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee hearing, saying he wanted to show that dangerous guns can be sold to anyone who has the money. Sen. M.E. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said the gun was similar to one that was used to wound him when he served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The measure awaiting <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' signature is designed to keep assault rifles and handguns with barrels 5 inches long or less out of the hands of convicted and wanted felons. It sets up instant background checks on resident purchasers; non-residents may have to wait up to a week while the checks are made before they can take home a gun. The system will be similar to that used by merchants checking the validity of a credit card. Gun dealers, after checking a purchaser's identification, will call a toll-free number operated by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. In minutes, an officer at a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> computer terminal will determine if the purchaser has a criminal record. At present in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, there are no identification requirements or other state restrictions on gun purchases. Gun owners who want to carry a concealed weapon need a permit, but for others, no license is required and no registration files are maintained. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> referred to the state's reputation as a gun exporter a week ago when he put some of the blame for his city's high murder rate on <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> guns. The impetus for the measure came in December when a student at a school in <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' hometown of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was charged with killing a teacher and wounding another with an assault gun. The final measure, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 33-6 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> 81-15 in February, was a carefully crafted compromise to satisfy gun dealers, gun control advocates and firearms owners. `` What we basically have is a win-win situation from the standpoint of everyone concerned,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> and Revolver Association. Gun owners lobbied for the instant-check provision because they did not want gun buyers to have to wait for days before taking home their purchases. They also won a provision preventing information in criminal background checks from being used as registration files. Gun dealers lobbied to make sure they would not be swamped with paperwork. The law places most of the record-keeping burden on <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. Advocates of gun control wanted an outright ban on sales of military-type rifles and small handguns but accepted background checks as a first step. State Delegate <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranwell </PERSON>, who wrote most of the compromise language, said his aim was to fix <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s reputation as an exporter of guns to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> drug dealers. `` I want to make sure those people buy their firearms somewhere else,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, state liaison with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is the first state to have an instant background checks law, although the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is looking into such a requirement nationwide. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> wants instant checks to replace waiting periods or license requirements in states that have such laws.

 A new coalition Cabinet on Sunday endorsed a tentative peace agreement with southern rebels, calling for an immediate cease-fire to a six-year civil war that has created a severe famine. The peace plan was the first act of the Cabinet of the war-weary country. The war costs the faltering economy $ 1 million a day, and the famine has killed hundreds of thousands of southerners. The peace plan calls for a controversial suspension of Islamic laws _ a rebel demand that has kept <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> from joining a Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s coalition government, which includes all other parties and interest groups An immediate cease-fire also is called for in the agreement. Information and Culture Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON> told reporters the Cabinet has decided to form a committee headed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sidahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to start contacts with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Cabinet has agreed on the peace initiative,'' <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON> told reporters. `` The committee will be in continued session as from now to see ways for contacting the -LRB- rebel -RRB- movement.'' Rebels led by Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> signed the agreement Nov. 16 with the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then the senior partner in <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s Cabinet. It calls for lifting the state of emergency in effect since President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> was overthrown in April 1985, and a constitutional conference to negotiate peace. Initially, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> refused to sign the agreement, maneuvring to deprive the Unionists of credit for reaching a settlement where his own party failed. This prompted the Unionists to quit the government in December. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> replaced them with the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. That move, coupled with a successful rebel offensive to capture a number of strategic garrison towns, led the army to intervene and issue an ultimatum for <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to resign or form a broad-based Cabinet to bring peace. Political parties and trade and professional unions supported the army's demands. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> finally complied and, after repeated delays, swore in his new Cabinet on Saturday. If the government succeeds in starting peace talks and calling a cease-fire, it would greatly help an international relief operation coordinated to send 100,000 tons of food and supplies to the south before the rainy season starts May. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has warned that 100,000 to 600,000 people could die in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> this summer if the operation fails. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s rebels have been fighting for economic reforms, more autonomy and end to the Islamic laws decreed by <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> in 1983. They were suspended when <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> was ousted in 1985. But the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> had been debating alternative laws based on the same harsh criminal punishments that include amputating limbs of thieves, flogging those who drink alcohol and stoning adulterers regardless of their religious affiliation.

<HEAD>House Speaker Walks Delicate Line</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> seems keenly aware that he's walking a fine line in leading the Democrats while besieged by an ethics committee probe of his personal finances. `` If you are unyielding, an absolutist, you're criticized for being a tyrant. And if you're cooperative and conciliatory, you're criticized for being so weak you had to make concessions,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> mused last week The subject was Democratic concessions on the minimum wage bill, but the speaker's comment could have applied to any issue that comes his way these days. The ethics investigation places the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for 34 years and its speaker since 1987, in the worst danger of his political career. If the panel's judgment is harsh, he could become the first speaker ever forced to resign the leadership post. As everyone waits for the verdict there is unease among the Democrats. At a news conference Friday following announcement of a new bipartisan agreement with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a Central American policy, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s top deputies made a point of praising the speaker's efforts. Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip, grabbed the microphones to make sure reporters knew the plan was the direct descendent of a 1987 effort by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had stuck to his guns despite skepticism even among his colleagues, and showed `` a willingness to take the heat, to give peace a chance,'' he said. `` If the speaker did not take the action at that point, we would not be here today,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. Until proven otherwise, most House Democrats are operating under the assumption that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will be cleared by the ethics committee `` I think the speaker has an enormous margin of wait-and-see support,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., although `` a damaging report would be very difficult for the speaker. `` My sense is a majority of Democrats do not expect the report to be damaging, but recognize the report will be used by the speaker's detractors and could be turned into a damaging tool,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s close allies. Most Democrats, many of whom were reluctant to discuss the matter, echoed <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' sentiments. The party is unlikely to abandon its speaker unless the ethics committee, which resumes its deliberations next month, recommends disciplinary action. `` If a majority of members thought that a person ought to be reprimanded, I believe that's inconsistent with the speakership,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` The unknown bothers people,'' said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the chief Democratic vote-counter. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s power as speaker has not been diminished, he said. `` His support is solid. I do n't see any lessening of support.'' There has been much less legislative activity in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this year than two years ago, when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> first became speaker and had an active agenda. In this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has repeatedly said the House was awaiting an agenda from the president. Two years ago, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was faced with a presidential proposal for a congressional pay raise and was able to maneuver so the raise took effect. This year, when a larger raise was proposed, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> took a political black eye while the raise was killed. Last week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s most vocal opponent, Republican <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, was elected the House Minority Whip. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said one of the reasons he won was his attacks on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, including the filing of the complaint that launched the ethics probe. To Democrats, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> represents the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s hard-line approach toward politics, aimed at wresting away control of the House for the first time in more than three decades. But, curiously, many Democrats feel better about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> since <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s elevation. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> himself is controversial and, in a leadership position, a much better target for the Democrats. `` It has sort of taken some of the sting out because people can go after him,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> `` a gold mine'' for the Democrats, who are threatening to make him a target of an ethics probe But <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said he was not sure attacking <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> would provide much political cover for Democrats to protect <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` I think the Wright -LRB- situation -RRB- is separate and apart, and it has to be judged on its own merits, based on the findings of the committee,'' he said.

 Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> broke his silence on political affairs Sunday by using the 10th anniversary of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty to criticize the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for opening talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Begin and the other surviving architect of th historic treaty, former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, praised the pact but expressed regret that it did not lead to a comprehensive settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the pact assassinated Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> four years after he signed it. There were no official ceremonies marking the occasion, reflecting the chilly relations between the two former <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> adversaries, mainly over the lack of a solution to the Palestinian problem. Israeli students did, however, sponsor a `` peace party'' at a convention center in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to mark the occasion of the signing of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s only peace treaty with an Arab state. No official ceremonies were held in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> either, and only one government - controlled newspaper mentioned the anniversary Columnist <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that although Arab countries accused <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> of treason when the treaty was signed, they now agree on the need for negotiations to peacefully end the conflict. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> broadcast interviews with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and Egyptian politicians and even played Egyptian music and <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> peace songs that led the pop charts a decade ago. The 75-year-old <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> took issue with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s latest peace move, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> that broke a 13-year American boycott of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. `` This is in my opinion a negative, harmful phenomenon,'' he said in his characteristically hoarse voice. `` The Americans, our friends, are in essence asked to reconsider this matter.'' Begin said he opposed formation of a Palestinian state in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as `` a danger to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the entire <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He complained that Palestinians persisted in clashing with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied lands and sending guerrillas to raid northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` If this is n't terror, it is difficult to know what terror is,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terror and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist that led to the Americans opening up a dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The uprising in the occupied lands is now in its 16th month and more than 400 Palestinians have been killed in the revolt, most by army gunfire at stone-throwing youths. Eighteen Israelis also have been killed. Referring to the treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> said: `` I have the feeling we achieved something very important, peace.'' Begin, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, reportedly became depressed over the death of his wife <PERSON> Aliza </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s losses in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war He resigned suddenly in 1983 and has lived in seclusion ever since. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was one of a half-dozen international figures connected with the 1979 treaty interviewed on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio on the anniversary. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 64, applauded the peace agreement's survival through persistent <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> violence, noting especially that it was not upset by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Both sides have courageously complied with the terms of the peace treaty,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who negotiated the accords at Camp David in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> between Begin and <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in September 1978. The following March 26, the three men signed the Israeli-Egypt peace treaty on the White House lawn. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he regretted that the peace pact did not spur other accords with Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors. `` My expectations and hopes and dreams were that building upon the principles established in the Camp David accords, that we would see a fairly rapid series of bilateral talks or negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and her neighbors, including the Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The Camp David accords offered a wide-ranging framework for settling the <LOCATION> Arab-Israei </LOCATION> conflict, calling on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to help negotiate a resolution of the Palestinian problem. They called for a five-year period of autonomy for Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as an interim solution before a final settlement was negotiated. `` That principle has not changed. I think it is still a good prescription for the future,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Palestinians rejected the plan at the time because it failed to guarantee them an independent state or a negotiating role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, still key issues in the dispute today.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, its image hurt by fires, starving elk and the slaughter of bison, is the focus of a high-powered public relations effort to restore the gleam to the national park system's crown jewel. Nature is slowly healing the wounds left from the summer of 1988's forest fires that burned nearly 1 million acres of the 2.2-million-acre park. But <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s magical lure is being crippled by vivid images of 200-foot-tall walls of flame that were projected into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s homes by television last year. `` The more sensationalistic coverage led the public to believe that <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> simply burned up, that there was nothing left,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. `` That's very far from the truth. The park is open, it's alive, it's well.'' Thick blankets of snow are slowly melting, uncovering in the park a new landscape. In some areas, where visitors once could not see beyond the green needles on the first phalanx of pines, the eye can now scan up hillsides of charred tree trunks. Lining sections of the Grand Loop that circles through <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s interior are blackened skeletons of once-majestic lodgepole pines. But in other areas, grass and wildflowers are sprouting along with lodgepole seedlings that got their start when the fires seared open pine cones, scattering seeds. Higher than usual numbers of winter deaths of elk and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s hunting of bison that roam north of the park's boundary have also hurt <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s image Park biologists agree some of the elk deaths can be traced to starvation stemming from the fire damage. But they also point out that recent mild winters and lush summers let some elk live beyond their normal years and so this year's more typical Yellowstone winter was bound to kill large numbers. As for the buffalo, there are killed when they wander outside the park because of the fear they may bring disease to livestock. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> defenders stress that the park is intended to be a natural environment, with death and fire as natural as regrowth and rebirth. `` The very simple solution to all of this would be to put up a 12-foot high cyclone fence around Yellowstone National Park, and we can now keep the buffalo in,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimek </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of that state's <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` And then we bring in the hay trucks and we feed all the elk and we keep them nice and fat, and then we put out all the pesky fires. `` As a tourism product, we compete with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> zoo,'' said <PERSON> Shimek </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> is not interested in competing with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> zoo. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> is interested in competing on the level of a wild, natural place.'' Getting the public to understand that concept and return to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> is costing <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> hundreds of thousands of dollars. Surveys taken in recent months found that many people said they were less likely to come to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and many tourism counselors foresaw a falloff in trips there. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, is sending media kits to 3,000 travel writers throughout the world. Those kits contain a fact sheet on what the fires did and did n't do, a story on the park's recovery program and an outline of the rehabilitation work. Also outlined are the projects the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is putting together to explain the ecological role of fire. Those projects will include an exhibit center and `` wayside exhibits'' along <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s road system that will describe where the fires roared and what they did. Also planned are nature trails that will lead visitors through burned and unburned areas. In the weeks to come, TV stations in the nation's major markets will receive videotapes depicting <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s rebirth. Tour operators also will be escorted through <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> to show them the park is still an attractive destination. The goal behind <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s decision to spend roughly $ 600,000 on the tourism campaign is to reverse the dip in advance bookings for the coming season, which at one point were running 33 percent behind normal for this time of year. `` Bookings are still down,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said, `` but there's a definite trend upwards.''

 History is repeating itself rather quickly in the demand by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> come from his home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to testify for <PERSON> North </PERSON> at his criminal trial. There was a gap of 167 years between the time <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> was subpoenaed and the 1974 summons to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, by then an ex-president. Less than 15 years passed before the subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. During the 1974 Watergate cover-up trial, former aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> almost succeeded in his request for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s appearance. It would have happened, too, had the former president not fallen critically ill following surgery. `` I would have loved to have <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in court, I had a few questions I wanted to ask him myself,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirica </PERSON> wrote in his memoirs. But at the time, a team of court-appointed doctors determined that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> would be in no condition to travel for some time, which would have delayed the trial. `` I ruled reluctantly,'' <PERSON> Sirica </PERSON> remembered of his decision that the former president would not have to appear. `` I did feel that no matter how anxious many of us were to see <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> face the lawyers and testify under oath, having him in court was not really critical to <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>'s defense.'' Had he gone on the witness stand, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> would have been the first ex-president to do so under subpoena. That dubious distinction will fall to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> accedes to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s request. The debate whether a president must obey subpoenas and other court orders dates to the beginning of the republic, and it is just as volatile today as it was then. President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> received a subpoena in 1807 demanding that he turn over a letter sought by defense lawyers in the treason case against <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s first vice president. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> wanted <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> to appear in court and testify about the letter written to the president by one of <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>'s alleged co-conspirators. Chief Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, presiding over the trial, declared that the president unlike a king was subject to law. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> cited the independence of the executive branch of government from the judicial branch and refused, at first, to release the letter. Eventually, he turned it over but made clear that his decision was voluntary and not in response to the subpoena. From then until Watergate, the concept of executive privilege was never tested. No sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminal trial, although several have provided testimony or what might be considered an equivalent. It is not difficult to see why <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers want <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to testify. Defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has attempted to show, in his cross examination of prosecution witnesses, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was much more involved in the secret aid to the Contra rebels than was known publicly before. The jury heard that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally approved an NSC-recommended deal in 1985 to give <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> $ 110 million in covert economic and military aid as an inducement to support the Contras. The jury also heard that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> apparently approved a plan from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and others in the government to airdrop intelligence data and recoilless rifles to the Contras for the purpose of destroying ships carrying arms to the Nicaraguan government. Those actions all were at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras. The closest the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has come to ruling on so-called executive privilege was in the Watergate tapes case of 1974. The special prosecutor had subpoenaed the White House for tapes of 64 conversation and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did n't want to give them up. In the case called <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> v. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> the court ruled unanimously that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had to comply with the subpoena. The specific need for evidence in a criminal case, the court said, outweighed the president's rights in the matter. In 1975, President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> gave a videotaped deposition as a defense witness in the trial of <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> -LRB- Squeaky -RRB- <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> who was convicted of attempting to assassinate <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers for the administration tried unsuccessfully to have the court accept a written statement by the president. The videotape was played in court. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, too, as president, gave videotaped testimony _ twice. Once was as a government witness in the perjury and gambling trial of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> state senator. The second time he taped testimony for a federal grand jury that was investigating allegations that fugitive financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> sought to bribe members of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was served with the subpoena while he was still president, along with then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Both men sought to quash the subpoenas. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> argued in a Jan. 13 court filing that the summonses `` raise profound constitutional concerns ... regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by a former or sitting president.'' He added that `` The spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjected to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the way they deal with the president now and in the future.'' On the day before the North trial started, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled the defendant had not shown that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` relevant and material'' testimony to give and squashed the subpoena against the new president. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> left the decision on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> open. He'll probably make it this week when the defense starts presentation of its case.

 Disposal of the kind of old dental fillings taken from millions of mouths has <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>'s family-owned dental supply company battling the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. At the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s partially-settled dispute with <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>'s company, 58 dentists, three other dental supply concerns and three individuals is how far the government can reach to hold parties accountable for toxic waste contamination <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>'s case has aroused attention on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> because some lawmakers believe the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has overstepped its bounds in the name of pollution prevention and accountability. The case hinges on amalgam _ the stuff that fillings are made of _ and whether it can be considered a `` hazardous substance'' after it has been removed from peoples' teeth. <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> company, which sells drill bits and other dental equipment, says it bought amalgam from its dentist customers and sold it to a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> metal reclamation business. Amalgam is a hard, durable alloy of mercury and silver. Dentists often save old fillings or leftover amalgam and sell it to processors, who break it down into mercury or silver. In <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>'s case, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> alleged that he and others sold amalgam to metal processor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourdeaudhui </PERSON> between 1969 and 1984. As a result of <PERSON> Bourdeaudhui </PERSON>'s efforts to break the amalgam down, the agency said soil in <LOCATION> Willington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, became so polluted with toxic mercury that it required a $ 710,000 cleanup in 1985. In seeking out responsible parties to pay for the cleanup, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> stunned the nationwide dental community by going after not only <PERSON> Bourdeaudhui </PERSON> but also 58 dentists and several dental suppliers who did business with him. The dentists settled last June with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which then sued the <ORGANIZATION> Ott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Benco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leventhal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Smith-Holden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> Also sued were <PERSON> Bourdeaudhui </PERSON>; his former wife, <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, an amalgam broker in <LOCATION> Whitehall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who also did business with <PERSON> Bourdeaudhui </PERSON>. On Feb. 16, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced that <ORGANIZATION> Benco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Bourdeaudhui </PERSON> settled for amounts ranging from $ 40,000 to $ 60,000. The other four parties are still battling the suit. <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, 36, said it is difficult for him to grasp that his family's firm, which has six full-time employees, has ended up in a federal court case about dental fillings. `` It's a question of liability and how far it can go,'' the younger <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> said. `` You can break water down into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could explode and the oxygen could feed the fire.'' <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> suit, which is being heard in a federal court in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, could wipe out the business that he had hoped to take over from his father. `` The fact that dental amalgam is considered a hazardous waste under Superfund comes as a surprise to many,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa., in a recent letter to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` A substance which is in my mouth _ and the mouths of millions of Americans _ and is deemed ` safe' by dentists and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> hardly seems a candidate for Superfund coverage.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., also wrote the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> last month saying he feared the case could discourage recycling by dentists `` The precedent of making recyclers of products liable for the hazardous byproducts of a recycling process that is not directly in their control creates a major disincentive for recycling,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the case should make dentists and dental suppliers more responsible. In announcing the settlements last month, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Regional Administrator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON> said the agreements `` demonstrate that members of the dental community understand that they have a responsibility to make themselves aware of dental amalgam's ultimate disposal method and that the dental community _ which controls the disposition of waste amalgam _ rather than taxpayers, should bear the cost of cleanup.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is reviewing the need for tougher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> curbs as well as expanded international cooperation to help block the export to Third World countries of chemicals and equipment for making poison gas weapons, a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Sunday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON>, undersecretary of commerce for export administration, said the steps could include new legislation or at least bolstered regulations for enforcing current export control statutes. `` We're reviewing the strengthening of controls,'' he said, noting that the policy review was being handled primarily by the State and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments, with some input from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> said he expects the review will be completed in the next few months. `` Most likely we wo n't need legislation, we just need further regulation,'' he said. `` And more importantly, I think it's likely that we'll be looking for international cooperation.'' <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 16 other industrialized nations have pledged to prevent the export of critical poison-gas chemicals and manufacturing equipment to four `` problem countries'' _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. But there are other mainly Third World countries, he said, which are believed to be interested in developing a chemical-weapons capability. `` You have a country such as <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> _ which is right next door to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and obviously has a concern about Libyan capacity to make chemical weapons _ where there are no controls whatsoever on that type of equipment or those chemicals,'' <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> said. Other countries which either have poison gas or are developing the capability of making it include <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` If you want to have a comprehensive, worldwide regime, you have to have a regime that controls both the precursor chemicals and the equipment to make chemical warfare agents to all the world outside of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the other 16 members of the <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> group,'' <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> said. The group of industrialized nations is so called because it was formed at a meeting held at the Australian embassy in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in 1985.

<HEAD>GOP Spending Doubled Democrats' in 1987-88 Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 During the 1987-88 election cycle the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> raised and spent more than double the amount of money taken in and spent by the Democrats, but the gap between the two parties' financial strength was less than in 1983-84, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. A report issued by the commission said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 263.3 million and spent $ 257 million in 1987-88, compared to $ 127.9 million raised and $ 121.9 million spent by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ran for re-election in 1983-84, the Republicans raised a record $ 297.9 million and spent $ 300.8 million, while the Democrats raised $ 98.5 million and spent $ 97.4 million. In 1987-88 the two parties were more closely matched in terms of so-called coordinated expenditures _ monies spent on behalf of federal candidates in the general election but not directly contributed to their campaign coffers. Coordinated expenditures by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> totalled $ 22.7 million, 27 percent more than the Democrats' $ 17.9 million The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> figure was nearly double the $ 9 million spent in coordination with general election campaigns in 1983-84, while coordinated expenditures by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rose only 13 percent from the $ 20.1 million reported in the earlier two-year period. During the most recent election cycle, direct contributions to candidates totalled $ 3.4 million for the Republicans and $ 1.7 million for the Democrats, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said. It reported that of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s total 1987-88 receipts, 87 percent came from individuals, 3 percent from state and local party organizations, 1 percent from political action committees, or PACs, and 9 percent from other sources. For the Democrats, the breakdown was 68 percent from individuals, 6 percent from state and local parties, 8 percent from PACs and 17 percent from other sources.

 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state has found a hangman to execute a prisoner who walked away from a work-release program to extract vengeance against a woman who testified against him after he assaulted her years earlier. If <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> goes to the gallows Thursday morning as scheduled, it would be the first hanging in the nation since <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> executed four men in 1965, including <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose story was told in the Truman Capote book `` In Cold Blood.'' The execution of <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, 34, for the brutal 1982 slayings of <PERSON> Renae </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicklund </PERSON>, her daughter and a neighbor would be the state's first in nearly 26 years <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s last avenue of appeals was to begin Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, but federal courts have turned him down in the past. His final state-level appeal ended last week when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a stay of his execution, scheduled for 12:01 a.m. Thursday. Barring a stay, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> will die by hanging in the high-ceilinged execution chamber at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION>, unless he decides to choose lethal injection of drugs, which he has so far refused to do. Hanging is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's official form of execution, although a prisoner may opt for injection. A bill that would ban hanging and make lethal injection the sole method of execution in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is stalled in a legislative committee. Only three other states _ <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ still have hanging as their official form of execution, though none has carried out a hanging in at least 40 years. In his appeal, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> argued that his rights were violated when he was allowed to miss the jury selection process, even though it was at his request. He also claimed he must serve prior sentences before being executed and that the state's decision to have two methods of execution violates his right to religious freedom because he is forced to make a choice in his own death. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON> said he plans to use basically the same appeal in federal court, `` packaged a little differently.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was convicted of leaving an Everett work-release center on April 14, 1982, and going to the <LOCATION> Clearview </LOCATION> home of Ms. <PERSON> Wicklund </PERSON>, 31, whose testimony about a prior attack had sent him to prison for sodomy and assault in 1974. She was severely beaten, her throat was slashed and she was raped with a blunt instrument. Her daughter, 8-year-old <PERSON> Shannah </PERSON>, had her throat slashed so violently she was nearly decapitated. A neighbor, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, 51, came to the Wicklunds' house during the murders and also had her throat slashed. Because hangings are so rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> officials had difficulty finding a qualified executioner, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, penitentiary spokesman. Prison Director <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincheloe </PERSON> said the executioner was hired in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for $ 1,500. Corrections officials are keeping the person's identity secret, prompting the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to ask for public records to prove the executioner's credentials. State and prison officials have said little about their preparations for the execution, hoping to avoid the carnival atmosphere that accompanied the recent execution in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> of another <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state resident, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>. `` We're trying to keep this as low-key as possible. We do n't want a circus, like <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s -LRB- execution -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Milne </PERSON>, spokesman for Gov <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. Opponents of capital punishment are gearing up for demonstrations against <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s pending execution. `` It is a gruesome business,'' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Abolish the Death Penalty. `` I'm appalled we would put so much energy into doing it.'' Demonstrations or candlelight vigils are planned at <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and the state capital at <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, she said. Prison officials planned to beef up security around the prison and to designate separate areas in a parking lot to keep opponents and supporters of the death penalty apart, <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> has had two previous execution dates postponed while his appeals made their way through both state and federal courts. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear an earlier appeal. Prison records indicate <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state executed 73 prisoners by hanging, some two at a time, after taking over the duty from counties in 1904. The present gallows were built in 1938. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Self </PERSON>, convicted of murder in the slaying of a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> taxicab driver, was the last to die here, in June 1963.

<TEXT>
 Producer <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> says Wednesday's Academy Awards will be `` the best show ever.'' But despite the hype, Oscar can easily be upstaged by the Hollywood sideshows sharing the bill each year. Who's wearing what and with whom _ the evening's Five Ws _ have been known to steal the show from the golden statuettes that come later, as arriving celebrities ritualistically alight from their lengthy black limos. On the party scene, the Academy's official Governor's Ball is generally a staid affair and Oscar winners usually make only obligatory appearances before heading to private parties. But this year, many stars will party while watching the awards on television. `` It is very fashionable this year to say, ` I'm not going to the Oscars,''' said celebrity insider <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who is also a public relations consultant for <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> hair stylist <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON>. Superagent <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> `` Swifty'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> will throw his annual Oscar soiree at the posh eatery <ORGANIZATION> Spago </ORGANIZATION>, with dozens of celebrities expected to gather there to watch the awards on television. Those expected include <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. The city's No. 1 celebrity of late, former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, turned down an invitation to <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>'s party to watch the awards with wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, at their <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home, said spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. Actress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> will hold a private get-together to watch the Oscars show, and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tova </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgnine </PERSON> will cast mock ballots with friends during a private party in their <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. Other mockers will gather at the Palace club in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, the scene of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raspberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s annual Oscar spoof ceremony, which this year will be held simultaneously with the Academy Awards. Guests will dine on a potluck dinner while viewing the real Oscar show on a large-screen TV. Presentation of the plastic `` Razzie'' trophies, which honor the worst in entertainment, will be made during commercial breaks. The Oscars ceremony may not be the only game in town Wednesday, but it could be the most expensive. A complete Academy Awards evening can range from $ 1,800 to $ 15,000 per person. A seat at the Shrine Auditorium ceremony costs $ 150, the Governor's Ball runs $ 450, it's $ 500 for a stretch-limousine, tuxedo rental is about $ 70 and designer gowns range from $ 1,200 to $ 12,000. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, who hired designers <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Klausen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> to spiff up the Oscar show, said the awards will be big, glitzy and nostalgic, more like a Broadway play than the annual parade to the podium. `` The trend this year will be drop-dead chic entrance gowns,'' said <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>. `` The idea this year is a return to great glamour, the Hollywood of the past. The public looks to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for glamour.'' He promised `` a lot of wonderful beading'' on the gowns. Two celebrities can particularly be expected to have the look that might make someone drop dead. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> can usually be counted on to expose her navel, and actress-model <PERSON> Edy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> habitually steps out of a limousine wearing not much of anything. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, the libidinous super vixen in `` Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,'' arrived with a stuffed puppie on her shoulder and doves on her head, but her revealing costume drew more ogling than her pets. She promises more of the same this year. `` It's going to be outrageous, and I'm in better shape, better condition because I've been working out,'' she said. She vowed her escort would be a pit bull named Bum Rap.

<TEXT>
 After years of watching their right to light up slowly whittled away, smokers are about to get some relief from the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The legislature is nearing enactment of a bill that would make it illegal for employers to refuse to hire someone because that person is a smoker. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are on record as supporting the measure, making it likely a bill will be sent to the governor before the legislature adjourns April 10. Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> has not taken a position on the issue. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereano </PERSON>, lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said he knows of no other state that has a similar law, although the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> legislature voted this year to prohibit discrimination by state and local governments against smokers. Identical bills introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> go much further than the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law, covering all private employers as well as public agencies. An employer could not refuse to hire or promote a worker or fire him simply because that employee smokes when he is not at work. Sponsors of the two bills say they deal with freedom and individual rights, not smoking, dismissing the arguments of opponents who say employers have a right to try to reduce the costs associated with smoking. `` I just see this as a right that people have to perform legal acts in their homes as long as it does n't jeopardize their job performance,'' Delegate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owings </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Friday. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> legislation was prompted in part by a policy adopted a year ago by the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire and rescue services. The suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, county makes new employees sign an agreement that they will not smoke on or off duty as long as they work for the department. <PERSON> Owings </PERSON>, whose district is in the tobacco growing region of southern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, said he wonders what will come next if employers can get away with telling people they ca n't smoke. `` Will they tell you that you ca n't watch Channel 9? You can only watch Channel 11 between the hours of 10 and seven? You ca n't read The Baltimore Sun `` What are they going to take away next?'' <PERSON> Owings </PERSON> asked. `` If you want to take it to the extremes, an employer, say a tobacco company, could say, ` If you want to work here, you have to smoke,''' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill, said he has seen newspapers ads offering jobs only for non-smokers, showing that the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> agency is not the only employer to penalize smokers. `` This is discrimination, and it ought to be a prohibited act,'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said. Opponents of the bill argued in committee and during floor debate that employers have a legitimate interest in whether their employees smoke because smokers have more health problems, resulting in higher health insurance costs. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said if employers can discriminate against smokers on the basis of higher costs, they can move on from there to discriminate against overweight people and people with high blood pressure.

<HEAD>Laotians Vote In First Communist Elections; No Policy Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Laotians voted Sunday in the first national election since communists seized power 13 years ago. Officials called the balloting a step toward `` socialist democracy'' but said it would bring no policy changes. Citizens of this impoverished, Southeast Asian nation chose members of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the highest state body. Officials said 121 candidates, about two-thirds of them <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, were running for the 79 seats. `` After the elections, there will be no political changes,'' acting President <PERSON> Phoumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vongvichit </PERSON> told reporters at a polling station, dismissing foreign reports of major leadership changes. `` Policy and direction remain unchanged,'' said <PERSON> Phoumi </PERSON>, who turns 80 next month. At another polling booth, 68-year-old Premier <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> <PERSON> Phomvihane </PERSON> boasted, `` The people wo n't let me quit. ... I am still the prime minister.'' <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> said a new government will be formed in about 18 months, after the newly elected national council drafts <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' first constitution. <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phoumi </PERSON> helped lead the decades-long communist guerrilla struggle against French colonial rulers and then the American-backed government during the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> has been premier since December 1975, when the communists won power, and has led the party since co-founding it in 1955. Hundreds of people were lined up at polling stations at schools, temples and government offices in the capital by the time polls opened Sunday. Many voters appeared confused. Some turned in unmarked ballots, and one 70-year-old grandmother asked a foreign reporter to mark hers. Officials said voting was not compulsory, but some citizens said they voted because they were not convinced there would be no penalty. At temples where foreign reporters were taken, many voters marked their ballots in open view. Many said they knew nothing about the candidates. The council comprised 45 appointed officials when it was established in 1975. Among <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' 3.8 million people, about 1.8 million aged 18 years or older were eligible to vote. Results from the 4,153 polling stations were to be counted by hand, which could take a week to 10 days. When polling ended in the evening, 10 officials at one polling station sat in a ring and turned a ballot box upside down and dumped ballots on straw mats. They marked the tally on a chalk board. Turnout at the station was more than 98 percent, they said. <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> said the polling was `` very important. The election enlarges people's democracy in a genuine way and encourages debate on who wants whom in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: who is good, who has the qualifications.'' But some foreign analysts called it mainly an attempt to convince the world <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> was stable and an attractive country for foreign investment, trade and aid. <PERSON> Sirichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirikai </PERSON>, a political scientist in neighboring <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said candidates were selected by authorities and there were no alternative political parties. The landlocked state is one of the world's poorest, with an average individual income estimated at $ 135 a year. In late 1986, the party endorsed Western-style economic reforms to try to reverse a decade of socialist policies. The first nationwide district and provincial elections were held last year.

<TEXT>
 Shortly after sunrise Sunday, about 30 members of the dwindling Western community gathered for an Easter service at the Italian Embassy, where the only remaining occupants are a priest and three dogs. As rain poured down outside, turning <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> into a morass of brown-gray mud, the Rev. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Panigati </PERSON> played a small, table-top organ and led worshipers through three choruses of `` Christ the Lord is Risen Today.'' The congregation of Catholics and Protestants vividly illustrated the effect of international politics. No diplomats were present, only aid workers and some military men from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 11 other countries evacuated their diplomats two months ago during the final phase of the now-completed Soviet military withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Some of those who most wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to leave were the ones who closed their embassies, professing fears security would deteriorate rapidly when there were no longer Soviet soldiers in the streets. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord that led to the Soviet withdrawal, now is reduced to 23 foreign staffers, one-fifth the number here eight months ago. Easter Sunday's congregation at the barricaded embassy, where the Italian flag still flies but no business is conducted, was a representative sample of the fluctuating Western community that rarely exceeds 150. The Roman Catholic Panigati, an Italian citizen who spent the last 24 years in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> teaching Afghan students and ministering to foreign Christians, does not want to leave. `` This is my parish,'' he said, gesturing at worshipers. They included Irish and Fijian colonels from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force established for the Soviet withdrawal, German nuns and laymen who nurse in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> hospitals, Swiss from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian Mennonite who stayed behind to help run an eye hospital after most of his associates were withdrawn by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missions </ORGANIZATION>, a Protestant aid organization. The Afghan government, trying hard but largely without success to distance itself from its communist coup-installed origins in 1979 and the accompanying political killings, imprisonments and torture, has harshly attacked the West for leaving <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a former secret police chief who took power in 1986, says he is ready to share power with the Moslem guerrillas. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement Wednesday appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations to reopen their embassies. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government repeatedly has denounced the embassy closures as a propaganda ploy to destabilize his government and boost morale of the U.S.-supported guerrillas, who have waged a decade-old war against the regime. The government observes that a bloodbath has not occurred in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15. Since then, days and even weeks have passed without guerrilla rockets landing in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, compared to the 20 or 30 rockets that were landing in the capital daily last fall. But the war is far from over, as evinced by new fortifications in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Soviet planes that bring missiles and ammunition as well as food, and the 20-day battle for the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, where the government's unverified figures say more than 2,100 people have been killed. But war's fears were set aside for a few minutes Easter morning as Panigati read the story of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s resurrection from the Gospel of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and a brown-and-white dog, a refugee from the now-shuttered <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, chased its tail. At the end of the half-hour service, the priest noted that the work of a few Christians in this war-devastated nation still can produce good results and he wished for `` peace for the beloved Afghan people.'' The last hymn of the Easter service was entitled `` The Strife is Over.''

<HEAD>Investigators Narrowing Search In Chilean Grapes Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that investigators have narrowed the search for those responsible for injecting cyanide in two grapes imported from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. While offering no indication that officials necessarily expect to make an arrest, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the incident _ which prompted the removal from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grocery shelves of all produce from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> _ could result in prosecution under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws. `` We do n't have the exact person who would have done it, but we do have a lot of information and we can trace back with a paper trail to the small producer where this particular crop came from,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television program `` Meet the Press.'' `` We do not know who did it, but the person ... would come under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws of tampering ... and tampering is subject to multiple years in jail and major, tens of thousands of dollars of fines,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. He also defended government action in removing Chilean products from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for several days while intensified inspection techniques were worked out with Chilean officials and acknowledged that there will never be a 100 percent guarantee against such tampering in the future. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said it is crucial for individual consumers to play a large role in insuring their own safety by inspecting the fruits and vegatables they eat. `` When you look at it, the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- government does one part, the exporting country does another part, the consumers do a third part,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Is visual inspection by a consumer really an effective way to reduce risk? `` Yes, it is,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> replied. `` In the case of fruit, you should be able to, if it is injected in, see the needle site and see the particular softening at that point. It's also important that in the large fruits, like apples, to look at the stem and blossom areas.'' Young, who also headed <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> during the cyanide poisoning of over-the-counter pain medication in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> several years ago, said there are almost always visible signs of tampering. `` What I was impressed with is, when we looked at all of the tampering that we've gone through, that even with medicines, when capsules were involved, any consumer that had looked at the dosage form would have seen that the capsule was tampered with,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. He denied any suggestion that his call for increased consumer awareness amounted to the agency shirking responsibility. `` I'd say that we have with the resources at hand moved these to meet a variety of crises and we can do that quite well,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` On the other hand, we can not do 100 percent safety. In the case of this inspection, we had to do a random sampling that we then, with a probability, a statistical probability, say that we've got the maximum feasible safety that can be done through inspection.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three months after he was convicted of 57 counts of securities, credit card and mail fraud, a man once considered a teen-age business genius returns to court Monday to be sentenced. A prosecution sentencing memorandum asked for a sentence of at least 25 years behind bars for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, saying such a term was `` more than justified'' for the 22-year-old man. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> could sentence <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> to up to 300 years. But defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> has said that is unlikely, and was expected to argue for a much shorter term than the government recommendation. `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is a young man ...,'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said after his client was convicted. `` I would hope <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> will still be a young man when he is released.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who was 16 when he launched his ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company in his parents' garage, has insisted he was a captive of mobsters who took over his company and forced him to commit fraud. The government claimed he was a shrewd con man who convinced Wall Street investors and TV talk show hosts that he was a business genius. `` He sold investors on a business which, for the most part, did not exist,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> who said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s manipulations cost investors over $ 25 million. The collapse of ZZZZ Best rocked the volatile <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money markets and exposed the vulnerability of major securities firms and banks which bought <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s sales pitch and committed millions to his company. The keystone of <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s scheme, devised with a number of associates, was a claim that ZZZZ Best was making a fortune restoring water - and fire-damaged buildings Investors were taken on tours of alleged restoration projects in abandoned buildings with which ZZZZ Best had no connection. At the height of his fame, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> lived in a $ 1 million house and drove a Ferrari. But he claimed he actually was living a nightmare of fear as gangsters moved in on his empire. `` I was just a front man for the mob,'' he testified at his trial. `` I was just a puppet.'' It became clear at the trial that <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> had dealings with such mob figures as the late <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Catain </PERSON>. The defense presented evidence that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police had investigated mob infiltration of ZZZZ Best. But the judge limited such testimony and jurors rejected the claim that <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> was a hostage of the mob.

 Moslem guerrillas bombarded <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> with rockets and artillery shells Sunday, and government forces retaliated with heavy air and ground attacks, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. A spokesman for the communist government said 248 guerrillas, 12 civilians and 3 soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. He said 55 others were wounded and 12 houses were destroyed. The official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said `` after a shameful defeat'' U.S.-backed rebels fled their positions around the city. But the guerrilla-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said insurgents were successfully attacking posts flanking the embattled city to the north and south. Rebels reported no death toll after Sunday fighting. There was no independent confirmation of either report. The government also said the rebels killed at least 50 people in attacks on four civilian buses elsewhere in the country on Saturday and Sunday. The last Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Feb. 15, ending a nine-year intervention. Soon after, the Moslem guerrillas established an Afghan government-in-exile in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and focused the fighting on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, located 75 miles east of the capital. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, told reporters the guerrillas pounded civilian and military areas of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> with 12,000 rockets and shells between Saturday and late Sunday. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> had a pre-war population of about 200,000 a decade ago. With many people fleeing the war to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or to other parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the population now is thought to be less than 100,000. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said government artillery and warplanes attacked the rebels at <LOCATION> Chaparhar </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karizi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kbir </PERSON>, both west of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, and at <LOCATION> Surkhrod </LOCATION> to the east. He also said a large number of weapons were destroyed, including six multiple rocket-launchers, three arms and ammunition depots and two tanks. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also said the guerrillas blew up two mini-buses carrying civilians on Sunday. He said he did not know how many people were aboard the buses. He said one attack occurred on the road connecting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Laghman </LOCATION>. The other, he said, occurred on the Jalalabad-Kabul highway. He also said the guerrillas detonated land mines that killed 10 people on two other buses in the past 24 hours. He said one attack occurred at Islam Qala near the Iranian border, while the other happened at <LOCATION> Sayed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karem </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province, which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, where basic foods have grown scarcer and more expensive because of guerrilla attacks on roads leading to the city and an exceptionally harsh winter, a small-scale free-food distribution program was resumed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. In <PERSON> Khair </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanna </PERSON>, one of the city's poorer districts, 600 women and children were given 22 pounds of flour and 6.6 Pounds of sugar each. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> program has targeted 30,000 people _ mostly pregnant women, nursing mothers, children and lepers _ for its food distribution program.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> leaves for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Monday on a tour aides describe as a diplomatic push to launch a peace initiative in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including a political settlement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The weeklong trip to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, with a stopover in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, underlines Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s transformation from being in the mid-1980s the focus of African resentment over what black states see as Western foot-dragging over South African apartheid. `` This is the beginning of an initiative,'' said a senior <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government source, speaking on condition on anonymity. `` But how far it will go is anybody's guess at the moment.'' <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, once an outspoken critic of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for her refusal to impose tough sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is planning a warm welcome for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. It is her first visit to the former white-ruled <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> steered to independence in 1980, and to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, another ex-colony. South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who held a surprise meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at her invitation in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on March 15, indicated before the trip that she could play a pivotal role in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview that South Africans have `` the highest regard'' for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s anti-sanctions stance `` We also think she is in a particularly good position to influence <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> states she is going to visit now to adopt a more pragmatic attitude toward developments in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> may try to build on recent agreements under which Soviet-supported Cuban troops will withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and U.N.-supervised elections will bring independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> will likely reiterate demands for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to impose tough embargoes against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a major trading partner. Talks in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> are expected to focus on new moves to end the civil war waged in neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> rebels and on the implementation of the Namibian peace settlement. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> denied published reports she plans to organize a southern African regional peace conference, but said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will help if asked.

<TEXT>
 French-born <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> did it right, which was wrong. He entered this country legally, so he must leave. Had he entered the country illegally, he could stay. Now it is too late to become an illegal alien and stay. So he really is an illegal alien and must go. Do n't laugh. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s not. Nor are his wife and four children. Or their friends. Or the townspeople. `` This is a Catch-22 bureaucratic boondoggle,'' said <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Some call it the French Fiasco. After selling their small, three-star hotel in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the vacationing <PERSON> Pointeaus </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1981 on tourist visas. They liked what they found. In 1982, they obtained an investor's visa and bought a motel in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciso </LOCATION> area. When his night clerk was slain, <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> sold the motel and moved his family to this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil town of 12,000. The Pointeaus purchased a 50 percent interest in a motel for $ 212,000. <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON>, and the couple's four daughters became honor students in school. <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Now, the family must sell or surrender their motel and pack up their possessions. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the fall told <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON>, 52, that the family will be deported by April 26. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials pointed to a series of alleged shortcomings but the most critical seemed to be that <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON>'s investment was not `` substantial'' and that his enterprise was marginal. `` The regulations do not define what is substantial,'' the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> conceded, but the agency noted that some consular offices use $ 250,000 as a `` point of departure.'' <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> said he appealed to the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> immigration office for help but was told, `` There is nothing we can do for you because you are legal.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, introduced legislation designed to rescue the family but got only a polite rebuff and a concession that immigration laws need changing. Referring to the recent pardon for many illegal aliens, <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said: `` What's ironic about this is that if he had not been here legally, if he had not renewed his visa each time, he would have been granted amnesty.'' Attorneys say the Pointeau affair may not be all that uncommon in the wake of a recent get-tough edict by immigration officials. In September, a petition circulated in <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> protesting the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> action picked up 1,837 signatures. Earlier this month, a citizens group pledged $ 3,000 to retain an attorney and pay filing fees for a lawsuit to delay deportation. `` Now I know what is the spirit of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> said last week in his disjointed English, which he speaks with a lilting French accent. When <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> headed for <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> and bought a stake in the motel, the town was riding the crest of an oil boom. Even after the boom went bust, <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> dutifully renewed his investor's visa each year and kept his motel afloat with hard work and modestly successful outside business ventures. Meanwhile, the four children, who now range in age from 13 to 21, were excelling at school. So was Mrs. <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON>, who graduated with high honors from a nearby college and is on the verge of obtaining a master's degree in French literature. `` She will not be able to graduate if we have to leave,'' <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> said. `` Year after year, it became fact that we all were living in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and that the children were receiving an eduation for a future life in this country,'' <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> said. `` After having lived here for years, we all started dreaming about becoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. `` Easy to say, tough to accomplish.'' After years of temporary visa renewals, the immigration office in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> notified <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> that another extension was being denied. Friends believe <PERSON> Pointeau </PERSON> can buy more time with the federal lawsuit. `` We wo n't let this die,'' said restaurant owner <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. `` This is a great cause to fight for.''

 Three-year-old <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>'s parents leaned down and asked the young Muscovite attired in a snowsuit who is his favorite candidate. `` <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>!'' their son exclaimed. Most adults voting at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> polling station No. 74 were as definite about their choice, and optimistic about what Sunday's multicandidate elections mean `` I think the quality of our leaders will improve because now we have a real democracy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Agababova </PERSON> as she sat on a windowsill and crossed out names of candidates she was voting against. Previously the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> allowed only one candidate for each seat. `` Once upon a time, we'd just take the forms and throw them into the ballot box. Now, for the first time, we're really voting,'' she said. The choice for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city seat between maverick communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and his opponent, automobile factory director <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, seemed clear-cut: Of 50 voters interviewed around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, 42 said they voted for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> _ `` naturally,'' said one. Only two said they chose <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>. But at polling station No. 74 in southern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a separate district race slowed the process. A small line formed before red-curtained voting booths and voters decided between a dozen candidates for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, including a television commentator, a professor of philosophy, a renowned military historian and a cosmonaut. Candidates have wooed voters over the past two months through election meetings and television appearances. As Soviets made their choice, the state media went into high gear. But they offered bland fare by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards, lacking the pizazz of high-tech <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> network coverage. Absent were early returns from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where the polls closed two hours after polls opened in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Complete election results are not expected until April 5. Many Soviets, however, said television was indispensable in helping them make their choices. `` I decided who to vote for in my local election as a result of the televised debates. My choice seemed more intelligent and had a more pleasing face; I guess it's the same reason many Americans voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said a 37-year-old <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> woman who declined to give her name. In the televised `` debates,'' as they were called, candidates gave speeches or answered reporters' questions. They seldom engaged in exchanges with their rivals. A poll published Saturday showed 38 percent of 2,000 respondents to a questionnaire in <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> newspaper criticized the media for lack of depth. Poll results published Saturday by the newspaper left out what Westerners would consider the main question: Which candidate will you vote for? The newspaper said 85 percent of respondents did want to give their choice. `` But it would have been tactless to assess the chances of candidates a day before the election,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy hijacked an Arab tycoon's yacht with five members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family and four Britons aboard and was holding them for ransom, news reports said Sunday Government information officers in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and other gulf states said that they had no information about the incident, which reportedly occurred Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> quoted diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> as saying the four Britons are young women who were aboard the 82-foot yacht, owned by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> royal family. The report said the yacht apparently was seized for ransom after it strayed into a sensitive area near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island. It said officials leaked information to the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards are demanding a ransom and negotiations between <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are going badly. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> first reported the story, saying the yacht had come from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and docked briefly at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, before leaving Thursday. Six hours after it sailed for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a distress signal was picked up, said the paper. Officials at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s leading yacht club, the <ORGANIZATION> Marina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said their registers showed a distress signal issued Thursday. A man speaking English with an Arabic accent said, `` My yacht is burning. What can I do?'' according to a club official. The caller did not respond to a request for his location. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> identified those aboard the yacht only as royal family members from an unidentified <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nation and four Britons. The newspaper said it had names of all those aboard but would not publish them `` to avoid affecting the secret contacts going on with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at the highest levels to end the incident.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign office said it was the first it had heard of the report. `` We've asked our embassies in the region but they know nothing about it,'' said a spokesman on condition of anonymity. Shipping executives speaking on condition of anonymity said there were at least two cases in recent months of `` pirates'' seizing vessels in the northern gulf. `` They just turn over people aboard to the nearest fishing boat and seize the boat,'' said one of the sources. The pirates most likely are Iranian, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> said the yacht probably is at <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>. The island was used as a base for gunboats manned by Revolutionary Guards during the 8-year gulf war. The gunboats were used to attack oil tankers and other merchant traffic in gulf shipping lanes. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was one of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s largest financial backers during the war and registered 11 tankers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> made its shipping a target. This prompted a large <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buildup in the gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> presence was one of the military setbacks that forced it to accept the Aug. 20 cease-fire ending the war. Kuwait-Iranian relations had been improving since the cease-fire. But friction surfaced March 15, when <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said a number of fugitives its government wants on charges ranging from espionage to coup plotting were free in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said: `` We have no information yet. We read the report like you in the newspaper.''

<HEAD>Government Mobilizes Thousands of Police To Halt Protests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government deployed thousands of riot troops throughout <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sunday in a crackdown on radical groups to end anti-government demonstrations. Students clashed with troops in two southern cities. Riot squads were posted outside important government buildings in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and at some major intersections. Police declined to say how many troops were deployed, but about 700 riot police in 18 buses were posted at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy Sunday. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> last week ordered security forces to take tough measures to halt a wave of protests and break up radical organizations he said were trying to stage a violent revolution. Radicals have called for the resignation of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who they say is not committed to genuine democracy. No incidents were reported in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but radical students clashed with riot police in the southern provincial cities of <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the national news agency. In <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>, police battled about 600 protesters who hurled firebombs and rocks after they were blocked from marching out of <ORGANIZATION> Chonbuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, several hundred students battled police after police stopped them from leaving <ORGANIZATION> Chonam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to support strikers at a shipyard, the report said. About 1,000 dissidents and radical students took part in a peaceful rally at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to demand <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s immediate resignation Dissident leaders denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and accused him of attempting to impose military rule. `` We call for the resignation of the Roh Tae-woo regime which can not carry out democratic reforms and does not represent the nation,'' said a declaration by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main dissident alliance. About 2,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets were posted in sidestreets around the campus. The protesters dispersed peacefully. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> also reported that police arrested about 600 students late Saturday after a violent protest earlier in the day at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in east <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> said it could not confirm the report. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> announced March 20 he was indefinitely postponing a promised referendum on his performance because of disputes over how to hold the vote and violent protests by radicals. The former general called the radicals a threat to political stability and said they were attempting to stage a leftist revolution. Radicals have mounted a series of violent anti-government protests, mainly on college campuses, to call for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s removal. But they lack public support because most South Koreans reject their violent tactics, and are not seen as a serious threat to the government's hold on power. It was not clear if <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> could win a referendum even though his government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms. Many South Koreans are critical of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> for his ties to his former ally and authoritarian predecessor, former president <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>.

 Country store owner <PERSON> Belva </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> runs her business on the `` honor system'' _ customers help themselves to the cash register. They do n't take her money, just change for their purchases if she's not around. They also make sandwiches, pump gas and dip for their own minnows at <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Grocery. `` I trust everyone,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, 53. `` You know, my son says that's my biggest downfall.'' She opens the store about 6:30 a.m., 30 minutes after an automatic timer makes the first pot of coffee for familiar faces, mostly coal miners, farmers and sportsmen. Cash for coffee is optional. `` There's a donation -LRB- can -RRB- back there,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>. `` If they want to donate they can, if they do n't want to, they do n't. I do n't pay attention to it.'' About $ 8 in bills and coins lies on the counter next to the cash register and folks walk in and out intermittently while Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> entertains a visitor. She links her business style to her Christian religious background. `` I do n't guess we've ever had anything stolen or ripped off, that I know of,'' she said. `` This is a really special place.'' The store, outside this Southern Illinois town of 400, has been in the family for 41 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> bought it from her in-laws 15 years ago this week. A father and son walk in, grab a soda and order a bologna and cheese sandwich. `` What time do you open?'' says the man. `` Six-thirty.'' `` OK,'' the man says, giving it some thought. `` But if I'm not here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> offers, `` you take -LRB- the minnows -RRB- and drop the money on the way back. We operate on the honor system around here.'' The store, in the shadow of a grain silo, is also a gossip shop, a bus stop, a drop-off point, `` whatever,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>. Customers, she says, `` talk about fishing, the local divorces.'' `` They'll come in, and say, ` What do you know? What did you find out last night? Any local gossip?''' Closing time is around 6 p.m., but Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> still has about five hours before bedtime. Nightly, she and her husband, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> _ both motorcycle fanatics _ meet a group of friends at a nearby truck stop for rides to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` We'll drive a hundred miles just to get a piece of pie, a cinnamon roll, a cup of coffee,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>. `` Rain or shine, it does n't make any difference.''

<HEAD>Police Clash with Ethnic Albanians for Fourth Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 1,000 ethnic Albanians jeered and threw stones at police in southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. It was the fourth straight day of protests of constitutional changes they say limit their autonomy. The state news agency did not say if there were casualties or gunfire, both reported in protests Saturday. The crowd, gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, shouted `` we will give our lives but not the constitution!'' as truckloads of police approached, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. They then scattered into side streets, hurling bricks and rocks at police, the agency said. Protesters shouted for police to `` set our comrades free,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said 146 demonstrators were arrested in the past four days. Most were convicted of `` petty crime'' and immediately sentenced to up to 60 days in jail. Police patrolled the streets of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, and <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> television showed police checking identity papers and inspecting cars. Fifteen miles away, in the town of <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION>, the focus of the past three days of riots, a small group gathered Sunday but was dispersed by police. Ethnic Albanians are protesting the provincial parliament's approval Thursday of constitutional amendments giving leaders from the mainly Christian republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more power in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> The ammendments go into effect Tuesday after approval by the parliament in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. They give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more power over police and judicial authorities and allow <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> to pass amendments affecting <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> without approval of the provincial parliament. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s provinces of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> have enjoyed considerable autonomy since 1974, but leaders of mainly Christian <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> said they needed more control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to protect the Serbian minority from the mainly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 1.8 million population. In an editorial carried by the Albanian state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> monitored in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, <ORGANIZATION> Zeri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popullit </ORGANIZATION> condemned the constitutional changes as `` anti-democratic.'' On Saturday, rioters reportedly shot at police, who used truncheons and tear gas to disperse more than 3,000 protesters. Ethnic Albanians also threw stones and bricks at police, broke the windows of a train at the local station and overturned three cars. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, 24 policemen were injured in the three days of <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION> riots, two seriously, though it was not known if any was wounded by gunfire. It was not known how many demonstrators were hurt, but <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said none had sought medical help at the local health center. The demonstrations rioting goes against a government ban on public gatherings imposed after protests last month.

<TEXT>
 Baby M, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> baby involved in a much-publicized custody fight that prompted national interest in surrogate motherhood, turns 3 years old on Monday. Her natural mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, had agreed to be artificially inseminated and then give the child to the natural father, but reneged on the deal after the baby was born. The girl, now known as <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, now lives with her father and his wife, <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tenafly </LOCATION>. `` I'm not at liberty to discuss'' where <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> will celebrate her birthday, Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Sunday from her home in <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION>, N.Y. When she agreed under a $ 10,000 contract to bear the child, she was a Brick Township housewife, married to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>. She rejected the money and sought custody of the child. In 1987, a lower court judge stripped her of all parental rights, in a case in which the baby was referred to Baby M. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> restored parental and visitation rights to Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> and outlawed surrogacy for pay in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The Star-Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> would spend the weekend with Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> and return to <LOCATION> Tenafly </LOCATION> on Monday. A judge ruled in a visitation order last year that the child could spend birthdays with the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> because she is being raised in their home and `` children normally have birthday parties with their friends.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> has since divorced <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> and remarried, and has become a campaigner against surrogacy. The Sterns continually decline to be interviewed. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> said Sunday that she planned to leave Monday for the last two weeks of a 22-city tour to promote the book she co-wrote about the custody fight.

 Christians emerged from underground shelters Sunday to celebrate Easter in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its suburbs but returned after a 12-hour lull in artillery battles ended at nightfall. Syrian troops and allied Druse militiamen pounded east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Christian-held region north of the city with multibarreled rocket launchers Sunday night, police said. Christian army gunners in hills above the capital struck back with 155mm howitzer barrages, targeting residential neighborhoods where they claim the Syrians set up rocket-launching batteries. Police said two people were killed and 12 wounded in Sunday's bombardments, which were separated by a 12-hour daytime lull That raised the overall toll to 94 killed and 326 wounded since the latest fighting broke out March 8. Residents on both sides of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line scurried back to basements and bomb shelters for a fourth straight night as the thunderous bombardment intensified. `` This is <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s brand of Easter fireworks, deadly fireworks,'' said <PERSON> Nada </PERSON> <PERSON> Akiki </PERSON>, a Christian housewife reached at her home near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound. Police said the power plant feeding <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from a Christian suburb was burning after taking several direct hits. Authorities started rationing residents to four hours' power a day. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> chief who also leads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, accused Syrian gunners of trying to assassinate him after police reported his residential palace and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> headquarters took at least 1,000 hits overnight Saturday. Another 4,000 rounds struck other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> suburbs, said police. They said 1,500 Christian shells struck <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Shiite Moslem southern slum, Druse-held towns along the Beirut-Damascus highway and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army positions in eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley the same night. `` This is not going to end. I am sure they're going to fight again,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawtharani </PERSON>, 35, a carpenter who took advantage of Sunday's lull to flee with his wife and four sons. `` We'll be safer in the south.'' Several car convoys, roofs loaded with beds and mattresses, streamed out of the Syrian-policed slums. Long queues formed outside supermarkets as others stockpiled food. Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, spiritual head of the powerful Maronite community, asked in his Easter sermon: `` How long should we be trapped like herds in shelters with cannons and multibarreled rocket launchers raining various kinds of death on us. Is this a way of living?'' The Islamic orphanage in the <LOCATION> Barbir </LOCATION> district abutting <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> said it came under Christian shellfire before dawn Sunday `` A divine miracle saved our 300 maimed and retarded patients,'' the orphanage's statement said. The latest fighting began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal militia-run ports that deprive the government of $ 100 million a year in tax revenue. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s move and in turn blockaded the Christian enclave. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rival governments emerged when former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to lead an acting military Cabinet after parliament failed to choose a successor when <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired Sept. 22. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mandate to end the war.

 A Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, man who received what was believed to be the nation's first successful heart-pancreas transplant Saturday, could be out of the hospital in a few weeks, hospital officials said Sunday. `` We think his recovery will be quite fast,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Light, <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> transplantation services director. `` If his recovery is uncomplicated, we expect he will be discharged within two or three weeks,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, 45, a senior scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> program, was a severe diabetic whose heart had been damaged by the disease to the point that it no longer functioned properly. `` This is a young man whose heart was basically destroyed by 25 years of diabetes but was basically healthy otherwise,'' Light said. `` He was a very good candidate for a heart transplant.'' Diabetes causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin, a hormone that regulates the metabolism of sugar in the body. Doctors decided that <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>'s diabetes was so severe that complications would result if only his heart were replaced. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> was admitted to the hospital Friday. Hospital officials said he was within days of death, and they decided to do both transplants on Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> proceeded with the operation although it lacked official permission to perform pancreas transplants from the district's <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. That agency must approve new services and technology offered by local hospitals.

 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> on Sunday failed to agree on new trade and transit treaties, Indian officials said, raising fears the landlocked Himalayan kingdom may face shortages of food and gasoline. The trade treaty expired a year ago and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> terminated its provisions Thursday, said the officials on condition of anonymity. A separate transit agreement expired Thursday, even though Nepalese authorities had asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to continue its provisions until a new arrangement was signed, officials said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> closed 13 of the 15 customs check points along the country's 1,090 - mile border with <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> after the treaties terminated, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Aftab </PERSON> <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> told reporters The officials also said the Indian government imposed customs duties on all goods exported from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. Under the transit treaty, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had allowed free access for overland transportation of goods imported and exported by <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. Most of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s foreign trade is either with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> or conducted through <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and border closings could lead to food and fuel shortages. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Shailendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Upadhaya </PERSON>, met his Indian counterpart, P.V. <PERSON> Narasimha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Sunday. Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ministers failed to reach an agreement. <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> said the two sides agreed to discuss the issue at a later, unspecified time. Officials said <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> rejected a <LOCATION> Nepalese </LOCATION> proposal that the trade and transit treaties should be negotiated jointly and not separately, as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had suggested. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> have enjoyed friendly relations for decades. There are no restrictions on travel between the neighbors. But reports from <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was increasingly concerned over <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s expanding relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> fought a border war with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1962 and since then, relations between the two nations have remained uneasy.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II Sunday offered Easter wishes in 55 languages to a world he said was driven toward self-destruction, and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> blamed politicians for violence in the Holy Land. The patriarch, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, made his comments before pilgrims at Easter Mass in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site where Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was resurrected. Elsewhere Sunday, shells and rockets pounded <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as Lebanese Christians commemorated Easter, and in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, about 30 members of the dwindling Western community gathered for services. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, Christians called for the pope to visit the communist nation, and in some parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Masses were held for the first time in years. About 180,000 faithful crowded the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s Square for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s message commemorating the resurrection of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. In his 20-minute speech in Italian, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> decried religious persecution, exploitation of women, degeneration of family life, sectarian strife and lack of concern for the environment. Earlier Sunday, the pope, squinting in the warm spring sun, held a Mass on the steps of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica. Calling Easter the new Passover, a reference to the Old Testament account of the miraculous rescue of the Jews in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said: `` God passes where there do not exist conditions worthy of a truly human life, through lack of housing, promiscuity, vagrancy, where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage and the family breaks up.'' He also decried violence against children and the `` shameful commerce of vice ... -LRB- where -RRB- women are still the main victim.'' The pope devoted much of his message, broadcast to 50 countries, to places `` where consciences are oppressed, where Christ's faithful can not openly invoke him or suffer persecution because of their love of him. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, the first Palestinian to serve as <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch _ or bishop _ of the city, alluded to the searing conflict between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in an Easter Mass. Under flickering candles and the glare of television lights, the Mass was intoned in Latin, French and Arabic as pilgrims from throughout the world crowded the chapel that many believe contains Christ's tomb. `` We find the reality of the Holy Land, a reality of death and suffering,'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said in an Easter plea for peace. `` We find those who tell us each day: We are hungry, we are humiliated, we are prisoners, we have no schooling,'' he said. `` We find those who have died and those who have yet to die while the politicians take their time finding answers.'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, named bishop in January 1987, never directly mentioned the Palestinian uprising that for 15 months has torn the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But his mention of the `` two peoples in this Holy Land'' and his repeated references to death clearly evoked the revolt in which more than 400 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died. In the Soviet Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, many Christians celebrated the Easter Mass for the first time in years. Last year, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> handed back confiscated cathedrals to many communities after decades in government hands. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, about 400 people gathered beneath the balcony of 89-year-old Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s Baroque residence shouting, `` Long Live Our Father!'' and `` We Want the Holy Father!'' in a call for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The demonstration of religious feeling came two weeks ahead of new negotiations between the Communist authorities and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to appoint new bishops. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is the only Soviet bloc country where Communist authorities have for decades blocked the appointment of religious leaders. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said: `` we live in a world in which the worst looks as if it is going to happen and the worst often does happen, and yet out of the anguish and waste, love and trust come in new forms.'' `` A sober look at the world seems to raise more fear than hope,'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> told the congregation at <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>.

 For the first time in more than 70 years, Soviets had a choice of candidates when they voted Sunday for a new parliament in an election <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hailed as a triumph for his vision of democracy. However, maverick candidate <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, running to represent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the new 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, claimed many Soviets were worried about vote fraud and said the election was n't completely democratic Polling stations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, festooned with red banners and Soviet flags, opened at 7 a.m. Eleven time zones to the east, in the <LOCATION> Kamchatka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION> regions of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, polls closed as Muscovites were still voting. The millions of voters elected 1,500 deputies to the congress, which will choose the country's president and elect about 400 of its members to a new full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, labor unions and other officially sanctioned organizations have already directly elected 750 members of the congress, which will meet once a year. Hundreds of races were contested for the first time in more than seven decades. The election marked a revolutionary change in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> politics, where the party has allowed only one approved candidate to run for each seat since the days of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported brisk to heavy voter turnout nationwide. At one precinct in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Krasnopresnenskaya </LOCATION> district, 84 percent of those eligible cast ballots, according to a Soviet television report. Final results may not be known for several days. Unofficial results given to Western reporters at three <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> precincts showed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> leading his opponent, auto plant director <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON> by 4,069 votes to 532, a margin of better than 7.5-to-1. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> campaigned against privileges afforded high Soviet officials and called for speeding the pace of reform to improve living standards for all. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is already assured of a seat in the new congress, and the elections are unlikely to produce any major upheaval in the present power structure, which is dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The last elections in which most Russians had a choice occurred weeks after the November 1917 revolution that swept <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> to power. In June 1987, two or more candidates competed in 4 percent of the races for municipal offices in what amounted to a test for greater democratization. But Sunday marked the first such balloting on a nationwide scale. In 74 percent of the districts, there were two or more competing candidates, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. However, according to the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, 82 percent of those running in Sunday's races are <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, guaranteeing the country's ruling political party will dominate whatever assembly emerges from the voting. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who with his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> voted at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the occasionally boisterous campaign caused by the multicandidate election was just what the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership wanted. `` The electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, holding a blue umbrella, stood beside him under a light rain. `` It has advanced the political thought and social activity of the people, and this is what we wanted to achieve.'' The 58-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, already elected to the congress by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, picked up a paper ballot, walked to a wooden voting booth and closed the curtain. After 25 seconds he emerged and dropped his ballot in a box. He would not disclose for whom he voted. The president said his policies of pressing for more democracy and openness in Soviet society, while not permitting any legal opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, are `` the key to opening the potential of our socialist society, with the purpose of taking into account the various interests of people and harmonizing them on the basis of consensus or a majority.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said political pluralism is `` not a panacea for solving problems and expressing a plurality of opinions.'' Despite calls by some protesters for a multiparty system, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was confident most Soviets supported his views. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, attempting a political comeback following his November 1987 ouster as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s party boss, voted at the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION> palace in the Soviet capital. He said the elections were `` not fully democratic'' but called them `` a big step forward.'' He told reporters Soviets in particular were `` worried about election results, worried that there will be deviation at election stations during the vote counting. Everything is troubling them.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who has become an anti-establishment figure in the city where he once headed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> machine, has charged the city's party apparatus is out to sabotage his candidacy. The Moscow-based <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which counts the ballots, said about 190 million of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 285 million people are eligible to vote. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the commission began its round-the-clock job of tabulating returns Sunday night, after receiving telegrams containing preliminary results from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaeev </PERSON> told reporters certified returns for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would be made public Monday night. The counting of ballots nationwide is expected to take several days. The election commission is required to make full returns public by April 5. All Soviets over 18 years old are permitted to vote unless they have been certified insane. Nearly 180,000 neighborhood polling stations opened their doors to voters Sunday morning and closed at 8 p.m. local time. Elections in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were until Sunday carefully choreographed rituals in which practically all eligible voters were said to turn out and those running got 99.9 percent of the vote. Some Soviets expressed satisfaction at finally having a choice, but there were also objections. `` I think the quality of our leaders will improve because now we have a real democracy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Agababova </PERSON> as she sat on a windowsill at voting precinct No. 5 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> district, crossing out names of candidates she opposed. `` Once upon a time, we'd just take the forms and throw them into the ballot box. Now, for the first time, we're really voting.'' But in southwestern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gagarin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where 12 candidates were running, `` some old people have gotten upset about having so many choices,'' said local elections secretary <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Safonkina </PERSON>. Three Soviet cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station _ <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> _ cast their ballots from orbit, radioing their choices to ground control in a less-than-secret ballot, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Twenty-nine more activists opposed to nuclear weapons were arrested at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site on Easter Sunday, bringing to 283 the number cited during the eight-day Lenten Desert Experience. About 75 demonstrators turned out for a prayer vigil at the main entrance to the test site 65 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said 27 people were arrested on state trespass charges for crossing a cattle guard on a road leading to the main gate.

Sunday's event marked the end of the eighth annual Lenten Desert Experience, an anti-nuclear protest sponsored by the Las Vegas-based <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Desert Experience. The 1,350-square-mile test site is surrounded only by a simple barbed wire fence, although areas where tests are conducted are heavily guarded.

 A mahogany desk once owned by the namesake of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is expected to fetch a record price at auction this summer, surpassing the $ 2.9 million sale of <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>'s console table. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s former desk-bookcase, which stands 9 feet, 5 inches tall, is expected to sell for more than $ 3 million at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on June 3, according to antique experts. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>'s console table was sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last November. `` There's never been anything like it on the market,'' <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> collector, told <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Antiques magazine.

Nine others survive. When <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the eldest of four brothers who made their fortunes in shipping and manufacturing, died in 1791, the desk was the most valuable object listed in his estate.

<HEAD>Soldier Honored 44 Years After Daring Feat To Release Jammed Bombs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THURMONT, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former soldier has finally gotten his recognition _ 44 years after he climbed into a bomber's open bomb bay with no parachute and manually dropped a dozen 250-pound bombs over <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> performed his feat in 20-below-zero temperatures and thin oxygen at 17,000 feet while anti-aircraft fire exploded around the plane, according to records. Authorities say he almost certainly saved the lives of the eight-man crew. The retired civilian <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> employee and former state commander of the American Legion received the Distinguished Flying Cross in a ceremony Saturday. On March 30, 1945, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> was in a B-17 bomber on a mission over the city of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION> when a malfunction made it impossible to release the plane's bombs automatically. The technical sergeant from Thurmont climbed into the bomb bay, hooked his leg around a small catwalk and began pulling pins that released the bombs to plummet into a railroad yard and munitions factory. `` It happened too fast to be scared. No one told me to do it, no one asked me, I just went down because I knew it had to be done,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said before receiving the medal. Although his colleagues at the time recommended he receive a medal, the war soon ended and in the confusion his honor was forgotten. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> did n't give it much thought until about five years ago when he ran into <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the flight's navigator. `` He said, ` I'm sorry the rest of the crew was n't around when you got your medal,''' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> remembered. `` I said, ` What medal?''' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, an attorney from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, started `` scratching around,'' for information, working with Rep. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, D-Md., to locate military records `` I would n't take a million dollars for my experiences,'' said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. `` But I would n't want to live through them again either.''

 National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> denied a report on Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials know who carried out the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103.

<HEAD>Truck Driver Wins Federal Suit Without Attorney; Awarded $200,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man whose formal schooling stopped at eighth grade took on City Hall in federal court without an attorney and won the largest award ever assessed the city for a political firing. `` I'm still amazed,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON>, 44, who expects a judgment totaling more than $ 200,000 after battling for five years to get his truck driving job back. `` I do n't see how I got through it.'' It was n't easy, apparently even for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON>, who for four days last summer goaded and helped Wzorek through the legal maze of presenting witnesses, introducing documents, cross-examinations and a passionate closing argument. `` He was winging it,'' said attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, who represented <LOCATION> Wzorek </LOCATION> during the second phase of the trial to determine benefits. `` It's a fun transcript to read,'' she said. `` Through the whole hearing, he apologizes many times to the judge and tells the judge: ` I'm trying like hell, judge. I'm trying like hell.''' Last Tuesday, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> reinstated and set the damages at $ 132,825 for back pay, $ 13,833 in interest, $ 3,750 in medical costs, and pension credits of nearly $ 30,000. Another attorney who worked with <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> during the second phase of the trial, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubbins </PERSON>, said the city probably will appeal, so <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> wo n't get his damage award anytime soon. <PERSON> Gubbins </PERSON> said the judgment is the largest of its kind ever handed down against the city. <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> also is being paid a salary and medical benefits reinstated by <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> until next November, although <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> has n't gone back to work. During the first part of the trial, which established that he had been improperly fired, Wzorek frequently called witnesses by their first names, said `` OK'' and `` sure'' to the judge and told an opposing witness he thought the man was lying. `` I'm nervous,'' <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> said to the judge at one point, `` and I do n't know what I'm doing.'' <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> argued that he was fired in 1984 by the <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> administration because he gave $ 1,000 to the unsuccessful mayoral campaign of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. The city said he was fired because of poor performance and absenteeism, even though <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> had high performance ratings and good attendance. The city is prohibited by a previous court ruling from firing employees for political reasons. When <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> first sued in 1984 he hired a lawyer, but the lawsuit languished until last summer when <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> decided there would be no more delays. At that time, <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON> had no lawyer. `` I was scared to death,'' he said, `` but I was even more afraid that if we did n't go to trial after all that time, the case would be thrown out.'' `` This shows the system does work,'' said <PERSON> Wzorek </PERSON>, `` ... that a little guy ... can take on the city and actually win, if he gets a fair shake from a judge.''

Moslems comprise nearly half of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s more than 100 million people. <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, would give no details of the ban or say when it began. Speculation about a possible ban mounted last week when customs agents started seizing copies of the book from travelers arriving at airports and seaports. <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and some other African nations also have banned <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, as have other nations with large Moslem populations. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, now is a British citizen. He has been in hiding since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, ordered his death on Feb. 14, saying <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> blasphemed Islam in his book. Iranian clerics have put a $ 5.2 million bounty on his head. In the novel prostitutes take the names of the wives of Islam's prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> Also, the book suggests that the Koran was not divinely inspired as Moslems believe. In Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, demonstrators protesting the book promised to greet <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign secretary with black flags to mourn his arrival on Monday, said <PERSON> Kausar </PERSON> <PERSON> Niazi </PERSON>, a protester in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The secretary, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, is cutting his trip to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from three days to 26 hours out of fear that Moslem outrage over the book will provoke anti-British demonstrations, officials said. Violent protests over the book have killed 19 people in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Both nations have banned the book. Hundreds of Moslems marched near the British Embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Sunday and called on Japanese not to read `` The Satanic Verses.'' They also demanded that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be killed. Speeches at a pre-march rally were interrupted again and again by protesters, who waved clenched fists and shouted, `` We want <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>!'' and `` Death to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>!'' Police said about 200 people joined the demonstration. Organizers put the number at 500. No incidents or arrests were reported. The Japanese government has stressed the need for freedom of expression and has not banned the novel. However, <PERSON> Raees </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, vice president of the 10,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, organizer of Sunday's protest, said the government told him the book will not be allowed into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and that attempts to translate it will be discouraged. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, demonstrators burned effigies of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> at two weekend demonstrations and demanded that `` The Satanic Verses'' be banned. More than 600 demonstrators marched Sunday in Reading, west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and burned effigies of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> at a rally in a park. Police confiscated a `` Rushdie Must Die'' banner being carried by three boys between the ages 6 and 8; a 4-year-old boy walking with his father shouted `` Kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>!'' A life-size effigy of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was burned and clubbed at a demonstration Saturday by about 3,000 people in <LOCATION> Dewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.

 The Iranian navy seized an Arab tycoon's yacht carrying up to five members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family and four Britons, diplomatic sources and news reports said Sunday A British report said the Iranian Revolutionary Guards were holding the yacht and demanding a ransom. There were conflicting accounts about the identities of the hostages. Press reports in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> area said five members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> royal family and four young <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> women were taken captive when the yacht was seized Thursday afternoon. A diplomatic source in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 82-foot yacht <PERSON> Sailka </PERSON> had four British male crew members on board when it disappeared in the northern gulf on a trip from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> issued a brief dispatch late Sunday saying `` responsible sources in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> denied the reports circulated by new agencies about the loss of a yacht carrying gulf and foreign individuals aboard. `` The sources in the two countries affirmed tonight that the official quarters had no information about the loss of any vessel or yacht or persons missing at sea.'' A Kuwaiti source said a report carried by a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> newspaper about the missing yacht `` is completely baseless. The government has no information whatever about the reported hijacking of the yacht.'' The source spoke with the condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> as saying the yacht was seized for ransom after it strayed into a sensitive area near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. It did not identify the sources but reported they said <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government officials had leaked details of the abductions to the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards were demanding a high ransom and negotiations between <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were going badly. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> reported the story under banner headlines. A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said, `` We have no information yet. We read the report like you in the newspaper.'' A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was asked about the report and he said, `` We've asked our embassies in the region but they know nothing about it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> said it had the names of the people aboard the comandeered yacht but would not publish them `` to avoid affecting the secret contacts going on with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at the highest levels to end the incident.'' But the usually reliable newspaper said that among the captives was the son of a prominent <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> who is not from the gulf region. It said the blue-and-white yacht had departed from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and docked at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. A distress signal was picked up at 4 p.m., six hours after the vessel left <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> Thursday for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, according to the report. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Covino </PERSON>, maintenance manager of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said a distress signal was received Thursday but the time he gave was about two hours later than that given by <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Covino </PERSON> reported that in the distress call a man speaking English with an Arabic accent said: `` My yacht is burning. What can I do.'' The yacht club manager said the caller did not respond to a request for his location. Gulf shipping executives noted that during the eight-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Iranian boats frequently seized vessels if they strayed into Iranian territorial waters. <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was a base for gunboats used by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards to attack oil tankers and other merchant ships during the war, which was halted by a cease-fire last August <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was one of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main financial backers during the war, and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> claimed the ships its gunboats attacked were providing supplies to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> registered 11 tankers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> provided a war fleet in the gulf to protect shipping. Other foreign forces also sent warships into the gulf. Kuwaiti-Iranian relations had been improving since the cease-fire, but friction surfaced March 15 when <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said a number of fugitives it was seeking for plotting a coup against the government were operating freely in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Three distant cousins of <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION>'s ruler, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, were among 112 passengers and crew aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet hijacked by Shiite Moslem gunman last April on a flight from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The hostages were released unharmed after the 16-day ordeal ended in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the fallen protege of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, led his rival for parliament by a margin of more than 7.5-to-1 in early, unofficial returns in Sunday's voting. Unofficial returns from three districts of the citywide <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> vote had <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> ahead with 4,069 votes to 532 for <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, director of the factory that makes ZIL limousines _ one of the flashiest symbols of Soviet privilege, which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> targeted in his campaign. Certified returns for the voting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would be made public Monday night, said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaeev </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> suggested earlier in the day that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> might cheat him out of his political comeback by rigging the vote count. Of more than 2,000 Soviets interviewed at polling places after voting, 1,734 were for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and 162 for <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>. Others either refused to disclose how they voted or expressed opposition to either candidate. The informal poll, conducted by Western correspondents, was not a scientifically accurate indicator of the outcome. But it supported <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s claim to widespread popular support, which has surfaced increasingly toward the end of the first seriously contested political race in the Soviet capital at least since the days of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s backers predicted he would win the support of 5 million of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 6.7 million eligible voters. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> himself predicted victory but declined to specify a margin. Large pro-Yeltsin rallies were held in the capital in the closing days of the campaign for the new 2,250 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the first seriously contested open political race in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since the days of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> `` People are worried about the election results, worried that there will be deviations at election stations during vote counting,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told reporters after voting Sunday. `` Everything is troubling them.'' `` Democracy depends on the election procedure, which has n't been tested yet,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 58, who headed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy and held non-voting membership on the ruling Politburo before his ouster, claims the party worked against his campaign. He accused party officials of restricting public access to his campaign speeches and said they tried to damage his election chances by setting up a commission in the final weeks of the campaign to investigate his conduct. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has demanded an end to special privileges for party and government officials, such as access to special stores and chauffeured luxury cars. He also has called for more radical economic reforms to fill empty store shelves. <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, 51, has said his top priority is to end food shortages by providing more machinery to farmers and improving storage and processing facilities. When <PERSON> Yeltin </PERSON> was asked if he was satisfied with his campaign for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s at-large seat in the new congress, he said Sunday: `` Not in its entirety. Maybe it's because there are things we're not used to This leap to democracy had some positive and negative processes.'' The election campaign, he said, was `` not fully democratic'' but was a `` big step forward'' from previous balloting in which only one candidate was put forward for each post. But the real test of democracy will be whether the vote count is fair, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who brought <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> into the leadership in 1985 and two years later oversaw his ouster on charges of making political mistakes and displaying personal ambition, said criticism of party officials is normal during campaigns and that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was not the only one who received it.

<HEAD>Eastern Seeks New Pilots In Class, Old Ones In Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Strikebound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, nearly idle while other carriers handled busy Easter weekend traffic, plans to return to federal court Monday hoping to have its pilots ordered back to work. The Miami-based carrier also intends to open a school for its first group of 40 to 50 newly hired replacement pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Eastern was forced to sit out what in years past has been one of its busiest, most profitable weekends. Routes from the airline's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> hub to the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> were the most heavily traveled on past Easter weekends, `` and of course they're not running them now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Sunday. Under orders from the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> scheduled new hearings in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to determine whether the 3-week-old walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,600 pilots is a sympathy strike, as the pilots claim, or is a separate strike seeking its own aims, as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management contends. Eastern asked a panel from the appeals court, meeting last week in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, to overturn <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' earlier ruling that let the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> honor picket lines set up March 4 by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Machinist union. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> claims the Railway Labor Act gives its members the right to show sympathy for the striking Machinists. The appeals court agreed, but added that `` a claim of a sympathy strike can not be used as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the Railway Labor Act.'' Eastern said if <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> finds that <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members stayed off the job not out of sympathy but primarily to pursue their own contract objectives, without having exhausted all collective bargaining options under law, `` the court would be expected to order them back to work.'' The pilots, however, expressed cautious satisfaction with the appeals court move, noting that the judges denied <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an immediate injunction. The appeals court ruling Friday called on <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to report back to the court after his hearings on the issue. The pilots union Sunday also continued to downplay <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to hire replacement pilots, saying there simply are n't enough pilots to fill available airline slots, especially at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the other carrier operated by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and his Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Young pilots know better than to go to work for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Saux </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s education committee. <PERSON> Saux </PERSON> said in a news release that he and other <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members have been meeting with pilots from regional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots across the nation. `` If Eastern thinks these pilots will replace the striking pilots at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, they have another thing coming,'' <PERSON> Saux </PERSON> said. `` We know these pilots and they know us. They understand what's at stake here.''

<HEAD>Cabin Crews Oppose Armed Guards On Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Permitting guards to carry loaded weapons on aircraft will not deter terrorists but could endanger the planes and passengers, a trade union representing airline cabin crews said Sunday. The Observer newspaper reported Sunday that police officers escorting top politicians and members of the royal family are being allowed to carry loaded guns onto British aircraft under security regulations revised after the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. Security personnel have been permitted to carry only unloaded firearms onto aircraft. `` The problem is that indiscriminate firing of guns, which could always occur, could create as much damage as anything else,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryde </PERSON>, national secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s civil aviation group. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday it would not discuss security matters. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> declined comment and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> said it had `` no knowledge'' of the matter. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, which the Observer identified as one of several airlines affected by the new order, also said it could not comment. <PERSON> Ryde </PERSON> said armed guards on aircraft would do little to deter terrorists. `` If the glass or shell of an aircraft is punctured, it could cause decompression with people being sucked out,'' he said. `` What could an armed guard have done to prevent what happened at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>?'' he asked. Investigators have said a bomb caused Flight 103 to explode in midair over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people on board and another 11 on the ground. The bomb was contained in a radio-cassette player in the baggage hold, they said. The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported an extremist <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> faction funded by Iranian radicals was responsible for the bombing, and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials know where the bombers are. The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, reported that the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> made and planted the bomb on behalf of Iranians seeking revenge for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> downing of an Iranian jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last summer. All 290 people on board the Iranian plane were killed. The newspaper quoted one source as saying the group was paid 10 million dollars to destroy the New York-bound jumbo jet. The <ORGANIZATION> PFLP </ORGANIZATION> is led by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> renegade who opposes <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s current drive for peace negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National security adviser Brent Scowcroft Sunday denied the report. Appearing on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face the Nation,'' Scowcroft said, `` We are not that far along'' in the investigation. `` As far as I know, we are narrowing it down significantly, but I do n't know that there is a resolution,'' he said. The Observer said the new <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> regulation reads: `` Firearms may be loaded when retained by police officers in the passenger cabin of an aircraft.'' The newspaper said the regulation was in a leaked copy of a `` restricted'' report on Flight 103 by the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ryde </PERSON>, a member of the committee, said armed police were not discussed when the committee held a crisis meeting in January, or at a regularly scheduled meeting in February. He said he had not seen the report.

 A mob of about 50 people attacked five police officers making an arrest Sunday, causing several minor injuries, authorities said. The officers were responding to a report about a man armed with a gun on a street in north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> shortly after 1 p.m., according to Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. When police arrived to investigate, a man fitting the description in the report punched two officers. About 50 people gathered while police handcuffed the man, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. When the officers tried to get him into a police vehicle, a second man attacked the officers and others in the crowd shoved the five, he said. Police said they arrested cousins <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 19, on charges of assault, risking a riot and resisting arrest. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said no gun was found. A sister of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, gave a different account of the confrontation. She said her brother had been fighting with his girlfriend but the argument ended before police arrived. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> denied to the officers that he had a gun but handed over a knife he was carrying, Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. She said the officers began pushing <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, bringing a protest from their mother, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. At that point, Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, the officers started beating her brother with nightsticks and then turned on Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said she received five stitches to close a head wound.

 The tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s governor, meanwhile, declared once-pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> a disaster area as the toll on the waterway's abundant wildlife began to mount The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the captain of the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, was not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> was in command. `` It's <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s policy that in the waters that the ship was located in, the captain should have been on the bridge,'' <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said. `` There's a problem there in that he was not there. It's our policy he should have been there.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran-Wescott </PERSON>, said she believed Cousin's actions violated federal regulations. `` He did n't have a proper pilot's license for that. He was n't authorized by the company, nor was it legal,'' she said <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said he did not know why <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was not on the bridge. `` I am unaware of any explanation he has made at this time. ... There is a full investigation that will occur on the incident,'' <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said, adding that the captain is consulting with an attorney. As clean-up efforts continued Sunday, fishermen fearing lost income sought compensation Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> held a meeting Sunday between fishermen and a company claims officer. `` We're not ready to absorb any loss,'' said <PERSON> Riki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION>. `` We expect full compensation.'' Ten supertankers remained anchored 33 miles from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, unable to move toward shore because the harbor remains closed. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said it ordered the closure to prevent pollution from being carried to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on vessels passing through the oil. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> said a wildlife specialist sailed in the sound Saturday and observed 75 ducks and two otters coated with oil. They could not be captured for cleaning, she said. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> declared Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> a disaster area, freeing state resources for cleanup and paving the way for a federal disaster declaration. `` This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said in a news release. `` It requires the most thorough response we can muster and this disaster declaration is an important part of that response. We'll be requesting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make a similar declaration.'' The 987-foot tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope crude oil loaded at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, ran onto a reef 25 miles from the port early Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is at the southern end of the 800-mile <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline. Estimates put the spill at 240,000 barrels of oil, or about 10.1 million gallons, making it the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spill on record. The only larger oil-related accident in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters was the spilling and burning of up to 10.7 million gallons of oil when two ships collided in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in 1979. More than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an effort to contain the oil, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. An additional 3,000 feet was to be deployed at <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> at the request of fishermen. Skimming boats worked to remove the oil. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated the area affected by the spill at 100 square miles. However, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> insisted that the area was only 10 to 12 square miles, and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were at a loss to explain the difference in estimates. The transfer of oil remaining aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> resumed late Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said about 84,000 gallons of oil an hour was being transferred; at that rate, the unloading could take seven days. By late Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship. Tests were under way to determine if dispersal chemicals should be used despite the potential for environmental damage. The agents need wave action to help break up the thick crude oil. Weather had been calm since the accident, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the wind was expected to increase to 25 mph and stir up a 5 - to 6-foot chop on the sound However, the wind and waves may make it more difficult to skim oil off the water, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieliczkiewicz </PERSON>. An experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil was completed early Sunday and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials were `` cautiously optimistic.'' Environmentalists, the governor and other top state officials have accused <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of responding too slowly to the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> operates the terminal at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> that loads tankers with North Slope crude. Both companies said they were satisfied with the handling of the problem. `` We're proceeding cautiously,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirigliano </PERSON>. `` We want to make sure we do n't make any mistakes in cleaning up the spill.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has reviewed information gathered by divers and determined there are five holes in the vessel's hull on the starboard side The largest is 20-by-6 feet. All six tanks along the port side remain intact. Four are oil tanks; two are ballast tanks. Investigation of the accident was turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. The ship's captain and two bridge crew members, including Cousins, were relieved of duty Saturday and subpoenaed by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said relieving the three was intended to allow them rest and was not a disciplinary measure. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was in his cabin at the time of the accident, <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said. The third member of the bridge crew was identified as helmsman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON>. The three were administered routine tests for drug and alcohol abuse, but the results were not immediately available, officials said. The spill came at a time when Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> fishermen were preparing for the herring season, which is followed by harvests of shellfish and salmon. Many are concerned they will get only minimal harvests because of the oil damage, and then will face the longer-term problem of bad publicity. `` This could ruin our reputation in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> markets for years to come,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a netter. The herring catch, which usually takes place in April, primarily is for the harvest of roe, a delicacy that brings up to $ 25 per pound in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It's possible they could avoid the oil,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Fish are not stupid. But they ca n't avoid the chemicals.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> said the beaches on which the herring spawn could be polluted. Fishermen said they have had two good years back to back, and some were spurred by that success to go into debt for new equipment this year. <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> said fishing is an economic mainstay in <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, more so than in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, which also draws tourists and has the oil terminal. `` Half of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> is operating on credit,'' <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Protesters Halt Logging In Friendly Standoff; 13 Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unusually friendly standoff between environmentalists and loggers in a national forest resulted in 13 arrests Sunday, including that of a man who buried himself neck-deep in a rock barricade. The demonstrators at the <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> were charged with disorderly conduct for blocking a road into the controversial North Roaring Devil timber sale site, according to a <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's dispatcher. About 30 protesters had camped on a bridge over the <LOCATION> Breitenbush </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and were there to greet <ORGANIZATION> Bugaboo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers when they arrived for a third day of logging in the disputed area. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has sold timber rights in the North Roaring Devil site for $ 1.6 million. Logging began Friday at the 33-acre area, located on a remote ridge about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. About 20 loggers gathered around the protesters' bonfire when they were unable to proceed into the cutting area, and the two sides spent several hours peacefully discussing their opposing views on old-growth logging. The protesters argued that the timber site is forested with old-growth trees that are hundreds of years old and is a nesting ground for spotted owls, which they say are endangered. `` I feel real sympathetic towards the loggers,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemstreet </PERSON>, a protester from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` I know they have to make a living and they have to feed their kids, but we need to come up with an alternative for them instead of cutting these trees down.'' The timber cutters stressed that their livelihoods are at stake and argued that the stand of timber at issue is comprised of second-growth trees, not the ancient old-growth trees. `` People need to sit down and talk things out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bugaboo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> contractor <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>. `` Something needs to be done.'' `` As far as I'm concerned, these people are protesting the wrong people,'' <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> added. `` They should be protesting the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, not us.'' The timber sale already is the focus of a environmental lawsuit challenging <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> timber management practices in the <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Sunday's arrests were made after the loggers left and sheriff's deputies arrived, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers The banner-carrying protesters obeyed an order to move off the bridge, but proceeded further along the logging road, refusing to clear the way. Authorities arrested the protesters at a 3-foot rock wall that had been built across the road, apparently overnight. A member of the radical environmental group Earth First! was buried up to his neck in the barricade.

 <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, its image hurt by fires, starving elk and the slaughter of bison, is the focus of a high-powered public relations effort to restore the gleam to the national park system's crown jewel.

 Takeover strategists, take note: Your future competition may have more in common with R2-D2 than with <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it has taught a computer to keep track of mergers and acquisitions by reading the Dow Jones news service ticker. The finance-minded software package, called Scisor, was created by the wife-and-husband team of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, N.Y. The prototype software could be adapted to `` almost any area in which human beings under intense deadline pressure have to struggle through smothering amounts of paperwork,'' <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said in an announcement for release Monday. Users can ask the computer questions in simple English and get answers back the same way, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said, giving this example: User: Who received an offer from <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Steel? System: <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> took over <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION>. The colorless language and relatively limited vocabulary of the Dow Jones wire made it ideal for experimentation, Ms. <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> said in an interview last week. Scisor did have some trouble at first with `` sweetened'' bids and `` tender'' offers, she said. `` It's not reasoning with the information. It's simply taking the facts in a story and putting them down. It does n't know if something is true or false or reasonable or unreasonable,'' she said. The Dow Jones wire, also called the `` ticker,'' contains boiled-down company announcements, corporate earnings reports, government actions affecting business and other information of interest to the investment community. The wire, a fixture in investment houses, is part of <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage unit is interested in <LOCATION> Scisor </LOCATION> and will be given a demonstration in coming weeks. But <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwynne </PERSON> said it may be one or two years before any part of GE begins offering a Scisor-based product. The text enters the computer electronically and the user communicates with the machine through a keyboard. It has a vocabulary of about 10,000 words. The system figures out a text by diagramming sentences in the manner of junior high school English classes. It extracts additional sense by using programmed-in expectations _ for example, that the bigger company is usually the acquiring one. Ms. <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> said some financial people who have seen Scisor in action are surprised how well it does. `` In the distant future, we can imagine the computer not as a static repository of information but as a librarian who not only knows where all the information in the library is kept, but also has read and understood everything in the library,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> said in the written announcement.

 Voters in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and its suburbs decide Tuesday whether to add a half-penny to their sales tax to finance an $ 8.4 billion highway and transit program, including a controversial 103-mile elevated railway. The metropolitan area of 2 million people is the nation's largest without an integrated freeway system A vast grid of north-south, east-west streets is stamped across the desert, relieved only by two Interstate highways and a piece of state freeway. <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents are saddled with some of the highest auto-insurance rates in the nation partly because of intersection collisions. `` The population of this valley is going to double in the future, whether we like it or not,'' says <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Drinkwater </PERSON>, mayor of the wealthy suburb of <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>. `` I've been here 43 years, and I do n't always like it, but we have to deal with it, and there's no way that there can be enough roads built to handle the traffic. `` We've got to get out of our cars and get them off the road.'' Response to Proposition 300 and its addition of a half-penny to the 6-cent sales tax is mixed. Neighborhood preservationists and tax-dollar watchers have lined up against it while expansionists in the metropolitan area called the Valley of the Sun back it. The ambitiousness of the ValTrans proposition can be read in its statistics _ expansion of the bus system from 350 vehicles to 1,500, running longer expanded hours; 23 miles of commuter rail; 27 miles of rapid-transit bus routes; and the 103 miles of automated rapid-transit rail lines. Cost estimates range from $ 8.4 billion to $ 10.4 billion by the year 2019, but proponents call it about $ 44 annually for an average household. Moreover, they say, the system will create 7,000 jobs and will help clean the air over the valley. Air travelers approaching the city may be surprised by a brown haze obscuring nearby mountains. The metropolitan area has just gone through a voluntary program to cut down on car use and other pollution causes. A new state law requires that gasoline be blended with oxygen additives, similar to a program in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, six months of the year to cut pollution. <PERSON> Drinkwater </PERSON> said the arguments against <ORGANIZATION> ValTrans </ORGANIZATION> were put forth 25 years ago against creation of a freeway system. That successful fight against unified freeway planning led the current chaotic state of driving here, he said. The only operating freeways in the metropolitan area are Interstate 10, which comes in from the west and bends southeastward toward <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>; Interstate 17, which splits off I-10 and heads north to <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>; and State Route 360, the Superstition Freeway, which extends eastward from I-10 in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. About 100 miles south, I-10 is the only freeway in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. But while that <LOCATION> Pima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seat has only about one-third as many people as greater <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, a coalition recently unveiled plans for a 1 percent sales-tax hike to raise $ 6.8 billion for transportation and other improvements there. The rail system is the sticking point for most ValTrans opponents. `` We agree that there are traffic-congestion problems,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasse </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senseless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>. `` VAST is not against mass transit but against the part of Proposition 300 that includes 103 miles of light rail.'' He and others said they doubt that Arizonans, accustomed to the California-pioneered style of suburban sprawl and freeway driving, would ever take a train to work. However, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, an insurance agent in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, said residents might welcome a chance to use alternative transportation. `` As an individual, I think it's a good idea for the greater good of everybody,'' <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> said. `` If it eliminates some of the cars and gets some order to this thing, it's a good idea.''
