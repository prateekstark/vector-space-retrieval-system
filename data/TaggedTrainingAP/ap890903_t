<HEAD>Israel Bombs Guerrilla Base in South Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes destroyed a guerrilla base in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> 21 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border Monday, the army said. All planes returned safely from the early morning raid, a military statement said. An army spokesman said the planes struck a guerrilla base in the village of <LOCATION> Majdal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balhis </LOCATION>, about three miles east of <LOCATION> Mashghara </LOCATION>. The spokesman, who is not identified under military regulations, would not say which militia operated the base nor give the reason for the raid. The air raid follows attacks Wednesday and Thursday in which Katyusha rockets were fired at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> district from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The attacks caused no injuries, but one rocket damaged a house in <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shmona </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. Israeli authorities blamed that rocket attack on the militant Shiite Moslem militia <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. Also on Thursday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops fought a battle with four guerrillas just north of the border, and one member of the Shiite militia Amal was killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> suffered no casualties in the firefight. The air attack was the the 10th time Israeli war planes have struck in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. The last raid, on Aug. 27, was aimed at a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> base.

 <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> brings solid political experience and a controversial personality to the campaign for which he is running as opposition vice presidential candidate in next February's election. While crowds at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday night cheered <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, the presidential candidate, hecklers three times shouted the name of <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>'s rival for the No. 2 spot. While perhaps not an auspicious start for a political candidate, <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>'s strong personality _ which some have described as arrogant and abrasive _ can take the heckling. The hostility stems from his four-year, eight-month tenure as Labor Minister under the leftist Sandinista government, against which he is running now. As Labor Minister, <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> instituted a system of salary levels that became widely unpopular. Detractors say his government post also makes his allegiance to the opposition somewhat suspect. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> was Labor Minister from July 19, 1979 to March 31, 1984, when he resigned. He said later that he quit because he disagreed with the leftist Sandinista ideology. His resignation however reflects his political talent _ the government gave him a going-away reception, showing he must have left in good stead. The 55-year-old lawyer has been better at defending himself from power plays within his own party, the Independent Liberals, than in attacking the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Political attacks against <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> stem not only from his personality as from his tenure as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years. One critic, who prefered to remain unidentified, called <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> `` dictatorial and Machiavellian.'' <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> follows a long tradition of Liberalism in his family. His grandfather, Gen. <PERSON> Paulino </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, was the spearhead of the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Liberal revolution of 1983. He has said that the slogan of the French revolution, `` Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood,'' encapsules the most important concepts for the individual and society. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> is married to <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, a Mexican; they have three children.

<TEXT>
 The latest cub born to the giant panda Ling-Ling died from complications caused by infections it developed either during or after birth, a National Zoo spokesman said Sunday. The female cub, born to <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> on Friday, was found dead early Sunday, said chief zoo spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoage </PERSON>. The cub was believed to have contracted the infection either while it was still in its mother's womb, or shortly after it was delivered. All of <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON>'s previous cubs have died. Had this one survived, it would be the first giant panda successfully bred in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 4-ounce female cub was confined to an oxygen-filled incubator since late Friday, and was fed a milk-like formula through a tube that was inserted down the throat and into the stomach. She was also innoculated with immunoglobins that had been prepared from the blood of her father, <LOCATION> Hsing-Hsing </LOCATION>, and given special formula antibiotics. <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> was known to have urinary and reproductive tract infections, <PERSON> Hoage </PERSON> said. The cub was the fifth that <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> had given birth to while in captivity. None of them had survived as long as the latest one. One of the cubs was born stillborn and the other three died shortly after birth. Previously <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON>'s longest-lived cub was born in 1987 and lived about 40 hours before dying, possibly because of the same infection that took the life of her most recent offspring, <PERSON> Hoage </PERSON> said. Ling-Ling and <LOCATION> Hsing-Hsing </LOCATION> were given to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government during President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1972. Since that time they have mated on numerous occasions, but <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> has only given birth four times.

 Rioting broke out early Sunday in this resort city, and more than 100 downtown stores were looted and at least two people shot before a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> military police attachment was deployed, authorities said. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, assistant director of public information for <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said guardsmen were called out by Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> shortly after 4 a.m. to assist local authorities. She did not have exact figures on the number of guardsmen involved. She said the rioting began around 2 a.m. when police confronted a mob on <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main beachfront thoroughfare. She had no estimate on the crowd size or what may have set off the rioting. City Manager <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> ordered much of the resort strip closed, and residents were told to avoid the area. An estimated more than 25,000 college students from predominantly black schools up and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> are in town for the annual Greekfest. <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said she did n't know if the riot was related to the gathering. Police reported at least four injuries, including the two men shot. <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> was unable to identify any of the injured or say what their condition was. She said police officers were not involved in the shootings. Police reported scattered gunfire and several fires in the area overnight. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said police, backed by state troopers and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, were in `` crowd control positions'' in the oceanfront area. At 7 a.m., the area was reported quiet. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanz </PERSON>, front desk manager at the <LOCATION> Kona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motel </LOCATION>, said authorities were not allowing anyone to leave the hotel `` even for breakfast'' unless they were checking out to go home. Many college students were staying at the motel, and they remained in their rooms while guardsmen and police patrolled the streets, she said. `` It's a heck of a way to end the season,'' she said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, desk clerk at the <LOCATION> Kona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> two blocks away, said some families were checking out of the motel early. He said cash registers from nearby stores had been hurled into the street by looters. `` It's pretty messy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former President Carter is Host to Ethiopian Talks This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, in the mode of his Camp David triumph, is staging talks this week between the Ethiopian government and Eritrean rebels on the 28-year-old war that has killed hundreds of thousands. Ten years ago, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> brokered the Camp David peace agreement between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The sessions beginning Thursday have a more modest goal: getting the two sides to sit down together. `` In the history of political affairs, the most significant single step is the first meeting,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said last month in announcing the talks. Previous attempts have failed to arrange talks between the Ethiopian government and the well-organized, heavily armed rebels fighting for independence for their province. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, during a July visit to the East African nation, said the opportunity for peace has never been better. The war has turned more than 1 million people into refugees. It has drained the Ethiopian economy, contributed to the suffering from famine and drought and led the government to bring in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military aid. The two sides now have agreed that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> should act as a neutral observer for the preliminary talks, which the participants say they hope will lead to more substantive meetings. Neither Ethiopian leader <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Isaias </PERSON> <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, will attend the meetings at the Carter Center. The center, opened in 1986, houses the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> presidential library and museum as well as a think tank, a conference center and offices of foundations devoted to peace and public health. Carter Center officials will not disclose the size of the negotiating teams, where the groups will stay or security plans. The meetings will be closed, and no one knows how long they will last. <PERSON> Dayle </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s director of conflict resolution programs, said extensive efforts have been made to ensure the negotiators feel comfortable during their stay. `` Not just their physical comfort, but the feeling of neutrality,'' she said. `` We are making every effort to provide for them a congenial environment in every aspect.'' For example, <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> personnel are careful not to term the <LOCATION> Ethiopian-Eritrean </LOCATION> conflict a `` civil war,'' which Ms. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said implies support for the government's view of the struggle as a conflict within a single state. Eritrean guerrillas, which share some Marxist principles with the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government, believe their province at the northern tip of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, with 3.5 million people, should be an independent nation. An ancient Ethiopian kingdom, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> has been ruled by the Ottoman Turks, the Italians and, finally, the British during World War II before becoming part of a federation with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> after the war. Fighting broke out between <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> in 1961 and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> annexed <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> in 1962. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> has long been coveted territory because its location on the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> gives <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> its only ports. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> came to power after the 1974 ouster of Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>, who had ruled since 1930. With the change in power came an increase in the Soviet presence in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the withdrawal, during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid and advisers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has continued to provide humanitarian aid. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently has directed less attention to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. A second rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, took up arms 14 years ago in a fight for increased autonomy in its province, which borders <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. It also has made overtures for peace and accepted <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as an observer, but that conflict will not be a part of this week's talks. The <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> talks mark the second time this year <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has been at the center of an major international event. Last spring he served as an observer in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s elections and then briefed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the voting, which he said was rife with fraud. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> plans to play a background role in the Ethiopian talks. He and his center will serve mainly as a vehicle for bringing the opposing sides together, according to Ms. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. Some of the principles of the 1979 Camp David talks can be applied here, Ms. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` What worked at Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> was that the parties met on neutral ground,'' she said. `` Neither side had the upper hand, and a third party was present with a sincere interest in resolution.'' Though the Camp David talks lasted 13 days, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> actually met face-to-face for only two days, Ms. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> literally shuttled back and forth,'' Ms. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` We hope that part wo n't be replicated. We hope they'll meet in the same room.''

<HEAD>Red Cross Says Exodus of East Germans to Begin Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities this week will begin the long-awaited exodus of East Germans seeking asylum in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials disclosed on Sunday. West German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> also said authorities believed East German police have infiltrated the emergency camps in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that are holding thousands of people awaiting safe passage to the West. `` We reckon that's so, but we're not equipped to do anything about it,'' he said in response to a question. He sought to dampen speculation that the transfer would begin Sunday, telling reporters the East Germans would leave `` sometime'' this week. Asked what was holding up the exodus, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said: `` We're awaiting word from the West German Embassy.'' Since vacationing East Germans began crowding the embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to demand passage to the West in July, the embassy has declined to comment on the developments. While legal travel to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is difficult for most East Germans, they have relatively little difficulty getting permission from their Communist government to visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a liberal Soviet bloc country. More than 1 million have vacationed here annually in the last few years. More than 200,000 East Germans were thought to be in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> before the weekend, and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> has estimated that up to 20,000 of them want to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A bilateral agreement obliges <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to send East Germans trying to flee to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> back to their homeland. But Hungarian officials have refused to do so, and their decision to permit the East Germans to go West has led to tensions with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. It also has resulted in a strengthening of ties with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where government officials have praised <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s handling of the problem. <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, a senior West German opposition official, last week called on government officials to provide financial and moral support for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders. On Saturday, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> appealed to countrymen to welcome the East Germans, while other officials and politicians called on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> leadership to stop the exodus by introducing reforms. Holidaying East Germans, frustrated by political rigidity and economic stagnation at home, began using <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as a springboard to the West after it started removing barbed wire and other barriers from its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in May. Since then, more than 6,000 are estimated to have fled to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which grants them automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives by giving them financial and social aid. Others seeking to emigrate first crowded the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. With government approval, Hungarian charitable organizations opened the first camps for East Germans in mid-August, after the crush of would-be refugees staying in the embassy forced <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to close it. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said that 4,000 East Germans had been placed in four camps and a small boarding house by early Sunday afternoon, following more than 1,000 new arrivals during the weekend. Hundreds more were staying in tents and trailers near the <LOCATION> Zanka </LOCATION> camp, about 90 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, said other <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials. While no official details of plans to move the East Germans had been made public by Sunday, developments in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the past week indicated they would be moved by rail through <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to temporary quarters in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, the main West German state bordering <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> Sunday, volunteer workers put the finishing touches on five tent communities with room for more than 5,000 people. Austrian rail officials continued to hold up to 50 railway cars ready for quick movement to border points with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Many of those in the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> camps huddled in tents or trailers to escape occasional showers, while others attended religious services on camp grounds or in city churches.

<HEAD>Child Care, Minimum Wage Remain at Front of Congress' Domestic Agenda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Areas of social concern _ child care, minimum wage, parental leave and greater opportunities for the disabled _ will be among the issues facing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it returns this week, but no one is predicting quick action. Child care legislation, the issue that became a focus of the 1988 presidential campaign, has passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill calls for direct grants to child care providers and would establish non-binding federal guidelines. But in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a companion bill is embroiled in a dispute between two committees with jurisdiction over it. Besides that, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans are pushing the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan _ tax credits for lower - and middle-income parents of children under age 4 regardless of whether both parents actually work and pay for outside child care Whether child care legislation passes the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before it recesses for the year sometime in November is anyone's guess, but legislative staffers believe if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does agree on a bill, it will be one that will be acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. The child care issue has been kicking around since 1971 when President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> vetoed legislation similar to that under consideration now, calling it anti-family. Another bill was considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1975, but never made it to the president. It remains at hot issue, with six of 10 Americans surveyed this summer in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC News Poll saying they think the federal government should provide child-care assistance to low - and middle-income families The main disagreement now is between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Basically, the Ways and Means approach is to put money for child care programs into block grants that go to the states with no strings attached. The committee already has acted by putting language on child care into the budget reconciliation bill. That legislation is the omnibus bill into which all committees are expected to contribute deficit reduction plans. A committee said the markup of the committee's proposal for the child care bill is scheduled for Thursday and will include an effort to make it conform to the budget reconciliation proposals. The provisions of the bill passed by Education and Labor include: _ putting more money into Head Start so those programs can run all day instead of half a day; _ using public school systems to help care for children over 3 years old; _ grants to providers for the children of parents who ca n't afford the full cost of day care; _ improving day care quality While containing the provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, the Education and Labor version goes further. As for minimum wage, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must reach a compromise with the White House if there is to be final action. After the first attempt at raising the minimum wage fell to a presidential veto, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., reintroduced the very same measure It has been voted out of committee and awaits a full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, but staff members say talks are going on with the administration to determine how it might be changed on the floor in a compromise with the White House. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., introduced a bill in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would raise the minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.25 by 1991, the maximum amount acceptable to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> But it does not contain a provision demanded by the White House that would allow employers to pay new workers a less-than-minimum wage for up to six months. The issue of family leave has gained the attention of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and awaits debate on the floor of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The measures would require employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for family emergencies. Another measure that may see its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this session is called the Americans with Disabilities Act. This bill is considered the most comprehensive civil rights measure since the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It would prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities in private sector employment, public accommodations, transportation, public services and telecommunications. It expected to be on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor soon with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action later in the fall.

 In the cocaine capital of the world, the new war between the government and traffickers is one of nerves as well as firepower. An industrial city of 2 million, cradled in lush green mountains, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> suffers almost daily bombings and burnings by the henchmen of drug bosses in a war that began with the Aug. 18 assassination of a presidential candidate. But bloodshed since that killing has been limited to unlucky bystanders in the past two weeks. Property, not people, has been the principal target, fear the main weapon. The city continues to function, its shops opening each day and its workers and businessmen filling the streets, factories and offices. But fear and tension is pervasive. `` There's no direct confrontation, but instead subversive actions ... sporadic and surprising,'' Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` It's harder to combat them than in a regular war.'' The government has arrested thousands of people and seized hundreds of millions of dollars in assets since it declared a crackdown on drug kingpins on the same day presidential hopeful <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was assassinated. Drug traffickers have responded with more shootings and bombings. In response to the traffickers' campaign of terror, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> last week imposed a strict 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. citywide curfew. He concedes that the measure was as much psychological as tactical. `` The curfew is not just to prevent the attacks, the bombs,'' he told foreign reporters at a news conference. `` It's also so that the entire community knows that we have a problem.'' For a city like <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, it's a drastic measure. The townspeople are known for a kind of restless joy of life and the night has always been vibrant, with the bars and dance halls full of loud music and people, drinking shots of the licorice-flavored local `` aguardiente.'' For the moment, the party's over. At 10 p.m. the city's 4,000 police aided by thousands of army soldiers take over the streets, armed with automatic and semi-automatic rifles. They round up curfew violators at gunpoint, hustling them down the streets to gathering points and packing them into city dumptrucks headed for a volleyball arena. Most of the violators are ill-dressed, sometimes barefoot drunks and tramps, as well as male and female prostitutes. Many stumble and sway, their eyes glazed by cheap alcohol. They yell and whistle derisively at their military guards, creating a din in the tin-roofed arena. The violators are held until the curfew ends at 6 a.m. Those found to have criminal charges pending are shipped to the police jailhouse. The rest are set free. `` This is just what the city needed. Now there are no more wounded, there are no more dead at night,'' said an army officer. `` Now the people can sleep in peace.'' But real peace has remained elusive. The morning after the curfew first took effect Wednesday, a bomb strapped to a juice vendor's bicycle blew up in broad daylight Several people were injured. `` It has n't stopped people from going outdoors, but when you do go out you always carry a fear that something will happen while you're passing by,'' said <PERSON> Rubiela </PERSON> <PERSON> Toro </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> housewife. So far, the traffickers' targets in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> have been political or economic: political party offices, statesmen's homes and country clubs, banks and factories have been bombed or burned. In recent days they've been seeking a truly big bang, evidently to further fray the stretched nerves of the community. They set up rockets to fire at a liquor plants' huge tanks of alcohol, but police interrupted the attempt. They fired rockets at gasoline storage tanks but missed. On Thursday, the bomb attached to the bicycle was placed outside the country's largest paint factory, and according to a company source, inside were 3,000 gallons of highly explosive nitroglycerin. `` If that bomb went off 30 yards down the street, half of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> would have blown up,'' said the source, who spoke on condition he not be identified. On Saturday, the traffickers took the battle to <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, setting off a powerful bomb outside the offices of the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>. Since <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> was founded in 1616 by <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> immigrants, its people have developed a repution for being keen traders and industrious entrepreneurs. But since the drug underworld emerged in the 1960s, dealing first in marijuana and now primarily in cocaine, that reputation has been sullied by gangland violence. Bloodshed reached new horrific heights in the last 18 months, with an underground war between the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and that of the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> for control of the $ 1 billion <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market. A <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> journalist said that up until the curfew, which put the feud on ice, his newspaper was reporting an average of six killings a day. The traffickers also have killed the provincial governor and police commander as well as scores of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> judges in a successful effort to avoid arrest. Judges and law enforcement officials are known to receive threats in the most terrible forms, such as a mutilated photograph of their children. The traffickers' new aim is to get the government to end its nationwide crackdown and agree to negotiations. The government, so far, has categorically rejected the suggestion. Mayor <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, however, favors talks with the cocaine barons and sees them as inevitable. `` No one knows when the war is going to end,'' he said. `` But I think it's going to end at the negotiating table.''

 She was once `` the most dangerous woman in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' For close to half a century, coal miners from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> knew her as a fiery champion of organized labor in an era when picket lines were often met with bayonets. Today, memories of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> `` Mother'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> have faded even in the coal-mining country where she is buried in the only union-owned cemetery in the nation. But a handful of labor activists and scholars want to ensure she is more than a footnote to the history of the labor movement. `` She serves as kind of an inspiration to workers who wo n't be satisfied until they are on an equal plane, in control of their destiny,'' said labor historian <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sangamon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, which holds an annual <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> commemoration. From the 1870s almost until her death in 1930, her white-haired, grandmotherly figure was in the thick of some of the nation's most bitter labor disputes. At a time when miners bought food from the company store and slept in company houses on company land, she was a fierce socialist who once bristled when called a `` great humanitarian.'' `` Get it right,'' she retorted. `` I'm not a humanitarian. I'm a hell-raiser.'' Her history is a litany of clashes with police, prosecutors and government authorities, most of whom she saw as tools of the `` high-class burglars'' who owned mines and factories. The authorities saw her as a subversive of the worst kind. `` There sits the most dangerous woman in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> prosecutor said of her in the early 1900s. `` She crooks her finger _ 20,000 contented men lay down their tools and walk out.'' Historians say <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was given to rewriting her own history, and indisputable facts about her early life are few. An Irish immigrant trained as a teacher, she lived briefly in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> but settled in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in the 1860s. She married an ironworker who was an active union member, and had three children. Her husband and children died in an 1867 epidemic of yellow fever, and the young widow moved back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where she worked as a dressmaker and was drawn into union work. Despite nearly 60 years as a labor organizer _ she was, by her reckoning, 100 years old at her death in 1930 _ her tangible legacy is limited, in part because of her distaste for institutions. Though closely associated with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, she feuded with some of its best-known leaders, such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. The miners union gave her permission to organize, but she never held office, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. It is also unclear how she made the leap from dressmaking to the coal fields. `` She was n't an administrator, she was n't a functionary,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` She suffered the bureaucrats very poorly. ... She would be just as upset today as she was in 1910 or 1920, and she'd be upset in some ways with the labor unions.'' Years before her death she requested burial in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olive </LOCATION>, about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, in a cemetery bought by miners as a resting place for four comrades killed in the <ORGANIZATION> Virden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massacre </ORGANIZATION>, an 1898 clash between striking workers and mine guards in a nearby town. For years, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' tomb was the site of an annual pilgrimage. `` They would have speakers, prominent labor people, thousands of visitors,'' says <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Krivi </PERSON>, a coal miner's daughter who as a 10-year-old filed past the tomb. `` You could n't walk down the sidewalk, the streets were so crowded.'' The annual tributes stopped as many of the area's mines shut down. Some of the tradition has been revived in recent years with the <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinner </PERSON> at Sangamon State that includes a pilgrimage to the gravesite. It is held the second Saturday in October. `` In the last 10 years she has started to get some attention, but until the'70s she was pretty much neglected,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` It's true not only in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> but in most of the country. One reason she is better known now is the existence of the 13-year-old San Francisco-based magazine <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a liberal journal best known for its expose on the problems of the Ford <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>. Today, a hand-lettered sign along Interstate 55 guides visitors to <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' grave, a 22-foot edifice of pink granite that towers over a one-acre cemetery bordered by cornfields. `` The resting place of real union people,'' reads a sign hanging from a wrought-iron arch over the cemetery gate.

 Thousands of blacks marched, picnicked and waded at a `` whites-only'' beach Sunday. Police made 58 arrests, but waited more than two hours before breaking up the protest. The crowd, estimated at 5,000 to 10,000, stretched for more than a mile along the shore, the biggest beach protest ever in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Organizers claimed a victory over segregation and vowed further acts of protest during a nationwide defiance campaign. Several dozen whites, some carrying whips and wearing `` whites only'' T-shirts, yelled abuse as the throng paraded along the segregated sections of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most heavily used beachfront. Other sections of the hotel-lined shore have been opened to all races in recent years. One angry white man barged into the crowd, yelling and pushing, but police said they could control the situation on their own. Some whites yelled to the officers, `` Shoot them dead.'' At one point, police arrested about 10 black youths who unfurled a flag of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. They remained in custody late Sunday, but police said the other 48 people arrested during the course of the protest were released after a few hours. The police contingent of several hundred officers was equipped with shot guns and a water cannon, but they made no efforts to stop the protesters from moving onto segregated <LOCATION> Addington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. In contrast, police used clubs and whips and arrested 500 people Saturday in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> while breaking up a planned protest march to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. White lifeguards remained at their posts during the beach protest and white surfers continued to paddle off the shore while black children splashed nearby. After about 2 -LCB- hours, police officers announced that the protest was illegal and began moving the crowd away. At a news conference later, protest leaders said they considered the event a success. `` It's the dawn of a new age,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogoba </PERSON>, a prominent Methodist leader. More than 1,300 people, including prominent activists such as Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, have been arrested since Wednesday in connection with the defiance campaign. Most have been released pending possible court action. The defiance campaign began Aug. 2 and has intensified steadily in the days leading to Wednesday's segregated parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority. A two-day national protest _ probably including a general strike _ is planned for Tuesday and Wednesday by major anti-apartheid groups. The majority of the beach protesters were youths, many wearing yellow caps with the slogan `` Free the Beaches.'' The crowd included many Indians and some whites as well as blacks. Local police officials had warned activists last week that the protest could trigger violence, and some roadblocks were set up in an attempt to keep protesters away from the beach. Police reported that several small bombs exploded Friday night in trash bins along the beachfront. Near the bins, pamphlets purportedly written by white right-wing extremists warned activists not to proceed with the protest. Previous targets of the defiance campaign have included segregated hospitals, schools and buses. Many activists have defied restrictions imposed on them following their release from detention, and several banned organizations have declared that they were resuming operations. Protesters were whipped by police at a defiance protest at a whites-only beach near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on Aug. 19. At least two Cabinet ministers of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have expressed regret for that incident, but the government has given no public indication that it is ready to make major changes in remaining segregation laws. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees, coal miners and phone workers are the symbol of both the uncertainty and solidarity the American labor movement reflects on this Labor Day. In an extraordinary year, labor has suffered some major losses yet won some impressive victories, although the spotlight on the negatives has tended to obscure the bright spots. A number of unions have proven that labor-management cooperation can work but, as in the case of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, learned as well that too much of a `` good'' thing can prove troublesome. Others have found hope in their solidarity _ particularly in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and miners' strikes _ but will spend labor's traditional holiday wondering if their jobs are the price they will pay for their pride and determination. The movement has lost one nemesis, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but gained another, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. Union workers here can take pride in remarkable developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ their dues helped support the Solidarity trade union from its underground days to its historic rise as leader of the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Through the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unions funneled thousands of dollars worth of printing equipment and other supplies to Solidarity while it was outlawed. `` I think the role of the American trade union movement in this should not be overlooked,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said last week. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, head of the 14-million member <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, the major umbrella group for the nearly 18 million Americans who belong to unions, says those who are eulogizing the labor movement do n't understand it `` The key to any evaluation of the labor movement ought to examine what we regard as the most important measure and that is internal cohesiveness and solidarity,'' he said. `` And I think it's fair to say that we do have a higher degree of solidarity and cohesion today than we've had in many, many years. A number of developments bolster <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>'s point. Among them: _ The virtually unprecedented support of the pilots' union when the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union struck Eastern on March 4 _ Joint negotiations between former enemies, the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and the `` baby Bell'' regional telephone companies That solidarity continued in a number of strikes against the regional companies. _ Nationwide wildcat strikes to support 1,700 miners who struck <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> after lengthy and bitter negotiations failed to bring a settlement <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to halt its contributions to union pension funds, a move that likely would cause other companies to follow suit. Still, there have been setbacks for labor as well. A trickle of defections among union pilots turned into a steady flow that has allowed Eastern _ and <LOCATION> Lorenzo </LOCATION> _ to move ahead with plans to reorganize the carrier as a smaller, non-union airline. Labor still hopes to use Congress and bankruptcy court to oust <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> but its chances appear slim as the strike reaches the six-month mark on Labor Day. The most highly publicized failure of `` Big Labor'' was the Auto Workers' defeat in an election at a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, its first attempt to organize a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant fully owned by the Japanese. At <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, and at other industries that traditionally have been the backbone of trade unions, the labor movement is running into two main obstacles: management programs to undermine union support by giving workers more say and perks, and intricate anti-union campaigns to defeat organizing drives including screening applicants to determine their attitudes toward unions. At <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> screened more than 100,000 workers for about 3,000 jobs. But <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said the Japanese are n't to blame for doing that. `` They are led into this course in some cases not by anything inherent in their culture or their own countries, because in many instances they have a history of dealing with trade unions in their own countries with good faith, but are following the advice of hustlers, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hustlers, who have made a new profession out of trying to guide employers for a fee,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. To counter such tactics, labor is changing the way it looks at organizing and now accepts as `` associate members'' workers at plants where organizing efforts failed and immigrant workers looking for residency status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. By getting its foot in the door, and offering those workers benefits such as cut-rate credit cards, insurance and legal services, unions hope to foster goodwill that will bring success in later elections. Such a concept, once reviled by traditionalists in the movement, has brought in 300,000 associate members in the past three years and, according to <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> and other federation officials, is beginning to pick up steam. The federation also is now stepping in to avoid most fighting among unions by deciding which affiliate should get the chance at non-union companies targeted for organizing. And the affiliates are making fresh efforts at attracting women, minorities and workers in the growing service sector. The noisy year for labor has to some degree obscured some remarkable contract agreements. The Steelworkers union won back many of the concessions workers were forced to give earlier in the decade when the industry was nearly crippled. The <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> came out of the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T talks and the regional negotiations settled so far with contracts that include innovative packages of parental leave, elder care and child care benefits. And <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers at a joint Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week agreed on a new contract believed to have the best job-protection provisions ever included in a major industrial contract. In the final months of 1989 the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike and legislative initiatives are likely to dominate labor's agenda. Pending on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> are efforts to raise the minimum wage and a number of other labor-backed measures, including expanded child care benefits and a number of bills designed to curb mergers and acquisitions. Also pending, but unlikely to pass, is a measure designed to force President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the Eastern strike. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> refers to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON>,'' sharing his former boss' pro-management bent but not his virulent anti-union philosophy. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Sunday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was striving to maintain close contact with the organized labor leadership. `` We talk at least once a week with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. Appearing on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Sunday'' program, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> noted that `` what I have been very pleased to see _ and we're urging a continuation of this approach _ is cooperation between management and labor.'' `` That trend has been occurring over the last 10 years. It's very important that it continue, if we're going to become ever more competitive on a global basis _ that there not be so much confrontation and more cooperation between management and labor,'' she said. Even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is regarded as no friend of the labor movement, he is not seen as its No. 1 enemy, as was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. That designation has been passed to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who was successful in making <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> a non-union carrier and appears on the verge of winning again at Eastern. His recent talk of selling <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has sparked hope in the labor movement that the airline unions might yet pull a victory out of defeat. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said there will be no winners even if the carrier returns to the union fold. But his contempt for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was clearly evident as he added a caveat. `` Scorched earth on both sides is not a victory,'' he said. `` Of course it's better than scorched earth on just one side.''

<HEAD>Rebels Hold Strategic Post But Offensive Checked</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Heavy air force and artillery bombardments by the Afghan army have failed to break rebel control of a strategic post near the border city of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, government officials and diplomats said Sunday. But the major assault by U.S.-backed rebels against the city appears to have stalled, they said. Also Sunday, the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement criticizing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for continuing to arm the Pakistani-based rebels, saying it underscored an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> desire for war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Government sources and diplomats said the assault on <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, which began 10 days ago, was aimed at gaining recognition from the non-aligned summit that begins in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> on Monday. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said in a statement released Sunday that he would seek special backing for his peace proposals at the conference. In the <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> fighting, government sources said the Afghan troops had recaptured three posts but still were trying to take four more fortified positions lost in earlier fighting. The most strategic of those was at <LOCATION> Daragai </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of the city, because it controls the main supply routes between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the capital. The provincial capital, just 18 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> border, is considered the most vulnerable to rebel assault because supply lines are so short. `` We have felt a lot of pressure in the last week,'' said one government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The threat has diminished, but their effort has not collapsed.'' The guerrillas issued a statement Saturday in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> saying the Afghan army had failed to take the position at <LOCATION> Daragai </LOCATION>. The official described the fighting around the city as `` serious.'' He said <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> remained secure because the strategic routes into the city were heavily mined. The government supplies its troops by air because the road to the capital has long been controlled by the rebels. Government troops also have been fighting rebel assaults around the city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of the capital, and in the southeastern province of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, the officials said. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was quiet a day after rocket attacks killed 16 and injured 52. The Afghan Foreign Ministry issued its criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in response to remarks made Thursday in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON>, special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to arm the guerrillas in their effort to topple the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> also support the rebels. <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON>'s statements `` indicate the war-mongering policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew its 115,000 troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February under a U.N.-sponsored agreement to end the fighting that started in 1979. The rebels formed an interim government but have failed in repeated efforts to capture a provincial capital to use as its seat. The president, speaking to the official agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> before his departure late Saturday, said he would propose that the non-aligned movement set up a committee to pursue his peace proposals. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> are expected to lead the fight against the committee. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has proposed negotiating with the rebels in conjunction with a six month cease-fire to be followed by nationwide elections.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Leader Stands Firm Against Democratic Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vietnamese leader <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> sharply rejected a multi-party system for his Communist nation and declared that freedom of speech amounts to anarchy. Expressing unease with the kind of changes sweeping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and other Communist countries, <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would keep liberalizing its economy but not its political system. `` It is not our policy to hasten renovation of the political system while preparations are still inadequate,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader said. `` Neither is it our intention to effect limitless democratization.'' `` The Communist Party of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is the leader, initiator and pacesetter in renovation,'' <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said. `` We shall not allow any force to set up any opposition party to work against the people and against socialism. Once again, we declare that we resolutely reject pluralism, a multi-party system or opposition parties.'' His comments came in a 10,000-word speech laden with Marxist terminology and dogma. <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, an economic reformer who has also taken some steps toward political liberalization, gave the address at a meeting in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Friday to mark <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s National Day. A text was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Sunday. Its basic thrust reflected a recent conservative trend in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, with official media lashing out at liberal reform in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Some observers believe the trend stems from leaders' fears that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s `` open-door'' economic policy will lead to a popular pro-democracy movement such as occurred in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Others, however, believe the recent conservative declarations are a tactical ploy by party liberals to appease conservative elements. `` Democracy does not mean that one is free to say what one wants to say, write what one wants to write and do what one wants to do, no matter what the consequences may be,'' the Communist leader said. `` These are essentially anarchist acts.'' <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> believes in the reform occurring in some Communist countries, there were `` opposition forces of all colors which are misusing liberalization and openness to fish in troubled waters.'' He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other `` imperialists'' of trying to undermine the Communist camp and launching `` frenzied attacks against socialism.'' However, <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said capitalist-style reforms would continue in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He said the pace of such changes has quickened considerably since they were first launched two years ago.

<HEAD>Regulators Ponder Reasons for Plants' Sudden Fall From Grace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two years ago the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> was on a roll. Today, it's on its back and federal regulators are wondering whether the traumatic tumble is symptomatic of broader problems in the nuclear industry. One concern is that owners of some plants, dissatisfied with the profit outlook in nuclear energy, are turning too much of their corporate attention to other businesses _ sometimes taking on projects far removed from the nuclear field. <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the Calvert Cliffs station, denies that its move into new enterprises in the early 1980s, including ownership of nursing homes, led to the nuclear plant's decline It says complacency was its downfall, and that an infusion of new senior managers will put the plant back on track. Whatever the reason, regulators are stunned that a nuclear plant long considered one of the best in the business could suddenly drop to near the bottom of the heap. Both of <LOCATION> Calvert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION>'s nuclear reactors have been closed since May because of mechanical problems. One may be restarted in October, the other next spring, although the utility must first get a go-ahead from the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which has had the plant under special surveillance since last winter. <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliffs </PERSON> is not the only source of worry for regulators. Although the nuclear industry's overall record in safety and efficiency has been improving lately, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is concerned that signs of trouble are cropping up unexpectedly at some plants. They cite as examples the <LOCATION> Surry </LOCATION> plant owned by <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which last May was hit with a $ 500,000 fine for violating <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules _ one of the largest fines ever imposed by the agency _ and the <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> plant of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION>, which in late August drew especially low marks in a regular <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> review of its operating performance. One of the dilemmas facing regulators is determining when a dropoff in performance at an individual plant may be serious enough to force a shutdown. There are no clear guidelines for making this judgment, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> now is mulling the case of the <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> nuclear station in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which has been ranked among the worst performers for three straight years in the commission's biannual review of operations at all 112 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plants. The commission has repeatedly criticized <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s performance, citing, among other things, unstable management by <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the plant owner Last June some <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials suggested the commission might force <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> to close if it did n't show improvement by the end of the year. Also, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast regional office, said recently he had `` a real concern'' that the reason for problems at the Nine Mile Point 1 nuclear plant, near <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was a `` diversion of attention'' by its owner, <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mohawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to its financial troubles. The most puzzling case, however, is Calvert Cliffs, which in August 1987 was inspected by a team from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and given a clean bill of health. `` Calvert Cliffs is a good example of what is expected from a well managed and operated plant,'' the inspectors' report said, adding that `` no shortcomings in equipment, personnel and operating practices were found that would compromise safe operation.'' The report included some mild criticism of the plant's maintenance and industrial safety training programs, but the overall judgment was that Calvert Cliffs was above the average of nuclear plants inspected in other countries Then the trouble began. Last spring and summer, Calvert Cliffs suffered a series of mishaps and was fined by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> for violations of safety regulations. The toughest blow, however, was an extraordinary incident last September in which a diver at the plant drowned in a water storage tank after disregarding safety rules. `` That shook them up; it shook us up,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murley </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s office of nuclear reactor regulation. Three months later the plant was put on the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s list of worst-run plants in the country, and this summer it was reaffirmed on the list. `` Their fall from grace came so quickly and they fell so far, given the good performance that they'd had over the years,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, said in a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> officials in mid-August. <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> says Calvert Cliffs had such a consistently good operating record in the past that its own managers _ and federal regulators _ may have become complacent. `` They had a halo effect for years,'' he said. <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> said he is confident that <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> methods of monitoring nuclear plant performance _ including special on-site audits about once a year _ are adequate to ensure public safety. But some other officials have expressed doubt about whether <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> warnings to plant owners are enough to force improvements. `` My problem with -LRB- yearly inspections -RRB- is they are so late,'' <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> told a recent commission meeting. `` They come out so long afterward, the guy can lull himself into saying, ` Well, we fixed that ... We are in better shape now.''

 Four white people who set fire to a church founded by freed slaves returned to the newly renovated building to give their court-ordered apologies to the congregation. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sircy </PERSON>, 22, bowed his head and cleared his throat during Saturday's dedication of the new <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AME </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, then said, `` We're sorry, but I know that's not enough.'' The congregation of about 60 people responded, `` Amen!'' `` What we did was wrong,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>, whose husband stood nearby. `` It was an accident, but it was still wrong. And I'm sorry. As <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, 19, spoke, her grandfather, <LOCATION> Herman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Adairville </LOCATION>, listened from the church doorway. Afterward he said he was proud of her courage in taking responsibility for her action. `` What's done is done; they ca n't bring it back,'' <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said. `` But they did what they could.'' <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 22, echoed that sentiment after the service. `` There just was n't a whole lot we could say _ just that we're sorry.'' The congregation gave the four young people a round of applause as they left the church. `` I think what they did was a fantastic gesture,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who grew up near the church. `` We are just amazed that this type of thing could happen,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON>, 57. `` When I lived here, this would have never have happened because of the racial prejudices in the area. I think it's wonderful that the court made them come out here and apologize. Last October the four young people, all residents of this rural western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town, pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> to breaking into the 116-year-old church and setting it on fire in May 1986.

But when Logan District Judge <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> sentenced them, he ordered them to apologize to the congregation of face contempt of court, with possibly a year in jail and a $ 500 fine. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> also put each of the four on probation for two years.

<HEAD>Texas Towns Feud Over Super Collider Fame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The superconducting super collider project has got three towns on a super collision course over bragging rights to the giant atom smasher, bringing out their big artillery on billboards and bumper stickers. All three _ <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Midlothian </LOCATION> _ want people to think of their town first when they think of the collider which is slated for <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and, in fact, wo n't touch any of the three. The fight is n't quite so heated as the battle that preceded it, when politicians all over the country sought to get the multibillion-dollar federal project in their state. Instead, it's a battle fought with bumper stickers and billboards. <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> proclaims itself `` Super Collider Country'' and <LOCATION> Midlothian </LOCATION> boasts it's the `` Gateway to the Super Collider.'' So far, <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> has smashed the competition. At 18,150 people, it is the biggest town in <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and will be encircled by the 53-mile collider ring. It calls itself `` The Center of Attention, Home of the super collider.'' The other two towns are on the outskirts of the ring, which is to be built in the country south of <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced in November that <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> would be the collider site, the <ORGANIZATION> Waxahachie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> printed hundreds of bumper stickers proclaiming itself the center. The town also rented billboard space off Interstate 35 to carry the same message. That was enough to make officials in <LOCATION> Ennis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midlothian </LOCATION> stomp in protest. <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON>, a town of about 14,150 people east of <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, countered with its own boast on a billboard on Interstate 45. `` The only thing <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> has is its name,'' said <PERSON> Kipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` It sticks. Even though it's hard to say, you do n't forget it.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokoll </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> city manager, scoffs at such talk. `` We are not going to let one peon city to the east like <LOCATION> Ennis </LOCATION> think they are the home of the super collider,'' <PERSON> Sokoll </PERSON> said. `` The only thing <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> does better than us is play football.'' <LOCATION> Midlothian </LOCATION>, population 5,000, wo n't be left out, said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundo </PERSON>, executive director of the town's chamber of commerce. She's the one who came up with the slogan: `` We are the Gateway to the Super Collider.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the state agency in charge of acquiring the land for the collider, is shying away from the feud. `` We have tried not to get caught up in the local competition,'' commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said last week. `` We have always referred to the super collider as being in <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' Ground has not been broken for the colossal project, but officials say it should be operational by 1996. The collider is expected to reveal new information about the nature of matter and the origins of the universe. It will hurl minute beams of protons toward one another inside a 53-mile tunnel. It is expected to create 4,000 temporary construction jobs and 3,000 permanent positions.

<HEAD>Grosz Rules Out Force By Hungarian Communists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> promised that the party will not use force to hold onto power if it loses the nation's first multi-party elections next year, a newspaper reported Sunday. In an interview by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Helsingin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanomat </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> acknowledged that Hungarian communists want to wield power. However, he added that the party would `` draw its own conclusions'' if it were to lose the elections, due to be held at the latest in 1990, according to the paper. `` We would not be satisfied with such a situation,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as saying. However, he ruled out using force as a political weapon, saying, `` We would not use tanks but political arguments to get back into power.'' He said he will step down as party general secretary during a party congress on Oct. 6, but that he would continue to be active in politics. `` I want to remain in the party leadership,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was scheduled to meet with President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s power was diluted in June when party reformers established a ruling presidium with the general secretary as one of four members. Party chairman <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> has described himself as `` first among equals'' on the new body. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Sunday, the reformers preparing for the party congress clashed over how far to go in revamping the party. Presidium members <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> spoke at a two-day conference of reformist communists held to plan strategy for the October congress. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> told the nearly 400 delegates that the party's political and economic policies must be revamped. However, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> went further, calling for a `` Copernican revolution,'' invoking the Polish astronomer whose discovery that the earth was round shook conservative-minded colleagues in the 16th century. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, in comments Saturday, appeared still more radical. He said `` dyed-in-the-wool Bolsheviks'' who can not accept far-reaching reforms should be free to split and form rival parties. Party Central Committee Secretary <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> told a rally Saturday that 10,000 members a month have been leaving the party in the recent past. He said only 200 new members had been enrolling each month. Since endorsing the idea of a multi-party democracy in February, the Hungarian communists suffered upset defeats in three parliamentary by-elections. The voting represented <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s freest voting in over 40 years. Party reformers, who advocate a free-market economy in addition to a pluralistic political system, hold views that often put them closer to some non-communist opposition groups than to conservatives in their own party.

<TEXT>
 When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announces his strategy to combat illegal drugs Tuesday, he'll be striding down a path similar to one trod 20 years ago by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. And by presidents before him. In the marijuana smoke-filled days of anti-Vietnam War protests when `` turn-on, tune-in and dropout'' were the watchwords for much of a generation, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> launched an aggressive law enforcement attack on drugs. He was n't the first. Cocaine and heroin were outlawed by the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1914. Marijuana was outlawed in 1937. The nation focused on heroin again in the 1950s, two decades after Prohibition was repealed, and two different versions of the Boggs Act, passed in 1952 and 1954, called for severe sentences for drug traffickers. President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> convened a White House Conference on Drug Abuse in 1963. Now, top government officials are talking of the possibility of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops fighting drug lords in a foreign land. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said Sunday that if the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government were to request more assistance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably would order American troops to take an active role. `` Is the president willing to risk American servicemen in this war on drugs?'' he was asked. `` Well, if that request ever came in, I'm sure the president would recognize that the American public thinks that the drug problem is so tough and so important that there is a great feeling amongst <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens that we probably should take even that risk,'' replied <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' also said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> would be at some risk and would be prepared to defend themselves. `` I ca n't guarantee that it's absolutely risk-free,'' said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` The possibility exists that they would become targets for the cartel. There is some risk involved. They -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel -RRB- will be able to defend themselves.'' In the last two decades, millions people have been arrested on drug charges, billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs have been seized, rock' n' roll stars and famous athletes have died of overdoses, and some inner cities have added deadly drug-related gunfights to existing problems of poverty, unemployment, discrimination and alcohol and heroin abuse. Billions of dollars have been spent on law enforcement, less for treatment and prevention. From fiscal 1981 through 1989, the federal government spent $ 16.5 billion for law enforcement, $ 2.4 billion for drug abuse prevention and $ 2.4 billion for treatment for a total expenditure of $ 21.3 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Most of that _ $ 13.6 billion _ was spent in the last three years: $ 10.4 billion for law enforcement, $ 1.7 billion for prevention and $ 1.5 billion for treatment. Meanwhile, cocaine is pouring over the nation's borders, domestic growers produce 25 percent of the nation's marijuana supply, and the heroin problem is growing. The price of the three drugs is going down and the purity is going up. The arrest and incarceration of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> _ a leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel who was extradited by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> two years ago _ did not make a dent in the operation of that cartel, reputed to be the world's largest cocaine organization, nor in the availability of cocaine. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of national drug control policy and the person who developed the basis for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategy by order of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged over the weekend that `` you can cut off the head and the body will still move and other heads will come in to replace it.'' However, he said in the interview on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, `` We think that when you disrupt a major criminal organization like this, you are disrupting the doing of their business, and that's a good thing.'' The strategy will hit hard on so-called casual users, with calls for more arrests, more seizures of personal property and more widespread drug-testing, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. The idea, he said, is to increase `` the sanction for drug use at every link in the chain.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> believes a turning point may already have been reached in the casual use of illegal drugs, pointing to the 1988 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. The survey found a 37 percent decrease from a 1985 survey in the number of people who said they had used marijuana, cocaine or other illicit drugs in the previous month. In addition, the survey indicated that the number of people who said they had used an illegal drug in the previous year fell by 25 percent over the three years. `` We are making some real progress in this war,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said when the survey was released in July. `` People who have been saying, ` All is lost, we ca n't win, let's legalize,' have never been more wrong.'' The survey found that the number of heavy cocaine users, including those using the highly addictive form of the drug called crack, rose sharply from 1985 to 1988 _ by 33 percent for those using it once a week or more and by 19 percent for daily and almost-daily users. On the other hand, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> attributed a drop in casual use to `` a triumph of changed attitudes.'' The `` Just Say No'' campaign launched by former first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a host of anti-drug advertisements on television and incessant verbal attacks by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and others on casual users apparently have had some impact, at least on what people say they do. But it is unclear whether they're really doing what they say they are. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'s Drug Use Forecasting report for the fourth quarter of 1988, based on confidential interviews and drug tests of people arrested in various cities, found that many of those people lied. Each person interviewed knew that a urinalysis would be done, yet in most cities, two to four times more drug users were detected by urinalysis than by self-reports, the <ORGANIZATION> NIJ </ORGANIZATION> found. For example, among men arrested and interviewed in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, 8 percent said they had used cocaine. Urine tests found 34 percent had done so.

 A majority of Britons blame bad management, rather than labor unions, for the nation's economic woes, a public opinion survey reported. The Sunday Times, which commissioned the poll, said 60 percent of respondents believe management is more to blame than unions. When asked if unions have too much power, 42 percent said no and 41 percent said yes _ the first time since 1975 that more respondents took the unions' side on that question in the poll, the report said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had a Labor government in 1975. It was ousted in 1979 after a winter of strikes against a pay freeze. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives are still in power 10 years later after restricting union power to call strikes and to support them with sympathy actions. A majority said most unions are controlled by a few extremists and militants, but 77 percent said unions are needed to protect workers' interests. The polling company, <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said it questioned 1,946 adults, including 440 union members, across the country.

<HEAD>Lebanese Fighting Flares After 18-Hour Lull</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Syrian and Christian forces fought with artillery in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountains on Sunday, shattering an 18-hour lull. Police said one person was killed and 11 were wounded in Sunday's exchanges The latest casualties raised the toll since the fighting broke out March 8 to at least 826 killed and 2,449 wounded. Sunday's battle flared around the mountain town of <LOCATION> Douar </LOCATION>, one of four routes into the besieged Christian heartland north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The clashes, which ignited forest fires, occurred on the eastern flank of the coastal enclave, ringed on its landward sides by the Syrians and their Moslem allies. They have reportedly been massing their forces in recent days, but they made no clear move to push into the Christian enclave Sunday. Though <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been battered nearly incessantly in the six months of fighting, the capital was quiet during Sunday's clashes. Christian and Moslem sectors of the city were hammered for 36 hours between Thursday and Saturday, when at least 20 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in one of the hardest-fought Syrian-Christian duels. On Sunday, Syrian howitzers and mortars pounded <PERSON> Douar </PERSON> and the resort towns of <LOCATION> Kekfaya </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Btighrin </PERSON> that are clustered around twisting roads leading into Christian territory, where an estimated 1 million people are trapped. The Christian forces, led by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, retaliated by hitting Syrian positions in the mountains with 155mm howitzer and tank fire, police said. Pine woods burned out of control because firefighters could not reach the battle zone northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman who can not be identified under standing regulations. The rival forces also skirmished with machine guns and truck-mounted 106mm recoilless guns around the mountaintop Christian stronghold of Souk el-Gharb southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> began the current round of a 14-year-old civil war by blockading ports controlled by Moslem militias. He then declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive Syrian forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The 40,000 Syrian troops came to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. However, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says they are backing the Moslem side in the civil war. The fighting has forced all but an estimated 150,000 of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million population to flee their devastated city

 Half of Americans say workers are better off with unions than without, but more people regard management favorably than view unions favorably, a poll has found. Many respondents in the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll saw unions as weakening, and few objected to that trend. Still, by a 49 percent to 31 percent margin, they said workers are better off with a union than without one. In what could be seen as a positive sign for the future of unions, young respondents, ages 18 to 29, were the most likely to favor unions. They scored higher than their elders on questions about their opinion of workers and about whether they think employees are better off under unions. Overall, however, non-unionized respondents were more unwilling than willing to join a union _ 47-37 percent, with the rest unsure. Moreover, while 44 percent thought of unions favorably, 64 percent had a positive view of management. And seven in 10 favored so-called right-to-work laws, which ban mandatory union membership. On other issues, the poll found most workers this Labor Day satisfied with their salaries, working conditions and time off. But 41 percent rated their pensions fair or poor, and 37 percent rated their pay as fair or poor. Nearly nine in 10 respondents backed raising the minimum wage, which has been $ 3.35 an hour since 1981. Most supported the $ 4.55 minimum approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the $ 4.25 urged by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but most also liked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan allowing new workers to be kept at $ 3.35 for their first six months. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed legislation in June that would have phased in a $ 4.55 minimum wage by 1991 and did not include his `` training wage'' proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the issue again this fall. The poll was conducted by telephone among a random sample of 1,163 adults from July 6-17. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points for the entire group and 4 points for the 812 who were employed. When rating their own circumstances at work, respondents gave the highest grades to the safety of their workplace _ 87 percent said `` excellent'' or `` good'' _ and their overall working conditions, with 81 percent favorable. Sixty-nine percent expressed satisfaction with their time off, 61 percent rated their health benefits favorably and 60 percent said their salary was excellent or good as opposed to only fair or poor. The lowest ratings went to pension benefits: Of those with an opinion, just 46 percent viewed their pension plans as excellent or good, while 41 percent were dissatisfied. A quarter overall rated their pension benefits as poor. Benefits were not the prime concern, however: Fifty-four percent said they would prefer better wages to better benefits. Concern over wages lessened among white-collar, management workers. Seventy-one percent of them rated their salaries favorably, compared with 57 percent of blue-collar workers and of non-management white-collar workers. Union members also were less likely to be concerned about their wages. Seventy-one percent were satisfied, equal to the salary satisfaction among management workers. Union and management split on another point: Union members said by 83-10 percent that workers are better off with unions, while management employees said by 46-37 percent that workers are better off non-unionized. Southerners also were more dubious of unions _ they split about evenly on the question _ while the youngest group -LRB- by 53-29 percent -RRB- and the oldest group -LRB- those over 64, by 52-21 -RRB- said workers are better off with unions. Union membership, declining over the years, now accounts for just under 17 percent of the nation's work force. In the poll, among those not in unions now, 38 percent in the youngest group ruled out joining one. That rose to about 50 percent of their elders. Similarly, 52 percent of the youngest had a favorable view of unions and 29 percent viewed unions unfavorably, while older people were split, about 40-40. The rest had no opinion. Forty-three percent overall said unions are getting weaker and just 15 percent said they are getting stronger. Still, 33 percent said unions in this country are too strong, while just 20 percent said they are too weak. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was called on to deliver his own impromptu sermon at church Sunday and promptly went out and caught a fish _ the first of his vacation. `` The jinx is broken!'' a jubilant president exclaimed as he came ashore with a two-foot-long bluefish. He had started the day at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where the Rev. <PERSON> Laman </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, after his own sermon, turned the pulpit over to the president, who told his fellow parishioners he was ready for the end of summer. `` Tomorrow it starts all over again,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I do n't know what you guys have to do, but I know what I've got to do: head back to work.'' Like a student beginning the new school year after Labor Day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he needed to `` start studying hard'' for the drug speech he will deliver to the nation Tuesday night. `` It's the first speech I'll give from the Oval Office. I'm not going to be scared,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who began the talk recalling how as a young child he would shake when called upon to recite a verse during the summer services at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of the signs of faith he has encountered in communist lands, and said, `` We're living in a time of real hope.'' He exhorted young people `` to involve yourselves in the lives of others. ... Do what you can to strengthen community life.'' `` Indeed, I'll be asking our country to do that'' as part of the anti-drug strategy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Remember, do n't ever forget that we are one nation under God,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was joined at the service by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, his mother <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other relatives. Then, after a fast change of clothes, it was out to sea in his speedboat Fidelity with wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, son <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. `` What a day,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had vowed to end his dry fishing spell before returning to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday after 20 days here at the family's oceanfront retreat. `` It was a long, dry summer, but it all worked out. `` It's what we call ` stick-to-it-ivness','' said the president, holding the glistening fish aloft with one hand as he steered the boat to the dock with the other. `` A tremendous fish. ... a very strong fish.'' He estimated it weighed `` nine or 10 pounds.'' He said they had been led to the magic spot by some birds circling overhead. There was no weigh-in, for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally cleaned and filleted the fish immediately upon docking. `` We're just going to get the steak,'' he said, tossing fish entrails into the cove waters. `` This is nature, return to nature,'' he said, `` because in about two hours you'll see the gulls in here picking this guy clean.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> performed the operation on a plastic bag, saving the head `` for soup.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got his bluefish after only a few minutes in the water at the outset of a 2 -LCB- - hour expedition They caught nothing else. `` My boy <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> was steering the boat at the time. He did a heckuva job. And as for General Scowcroft and Bar, they were along,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who prides himself on his fishing abilities, had become the butt of jokes, including a <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> `` No Fish'' insignia that became a best-selling T-shirt. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went golfing later Sunday, and planned one final fishing outing Monday morning before flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early in the Labor Day holiday afternoon.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was n't out to `` look busy'' on his vacation. No, this was a real vacation, pure and simple, he insisted. Just to make sure everyone got the point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent the last three weeks showcasing his good time. Americans saw him boating, playing tennis, golfing, dining out, jogging, playing ball and otherwise having daily doses of fun. His self-ascribed nickname, Mr. Smooth, became almost a household word. His bad-luck fishing streak was the subject of media accounts nationwide. And when the president on a dare stripped off his shirt and leaped into the sea with his slacks on, the burst of goofiness was carried on the nightly news. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent more hours in the public eye during his vacation than he normally does at the White House. Unlike many past presidents who used vacations to get out of the limelight, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to relish the chance to show off his recreational penchants. Away from the suit-and-tie world of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a study in perpetual sports motion. His golf speed _ 18 holes in around two hours _ was dubbed `` aerobic golf'' by presidential physician <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>. A keen competitive streak, tempered by apparent good sportsmanship, was evident in everything he did from fishing to horseshoes. Some might even say the president showed himself to be something of a ham. There was the Sunday when he could have sent the press corps home for a few hours after taking them to two church services. Instead he invited them to his Walker's Point compound to watch his tennis match. Typically, the president's activities on <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point are not observed by the press corps. But on this day, he suggested maybe the reporters would like to see `` Mr. Smooth'' in action on the courts. Mr. Smooth is the name <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> uses for himself in horseshoes and golf _ as in, `` Here comes Mr. Smooth.'' When the press corps began covering the president's <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> golf outings some months back, reporters and photographers watched him tee off, then picked him up again on the last hole. Now, the small press pool that accompanies him to the course covers anywhere from four holes to all 18, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approval. He was even heard to mutter, `` I do better when they're here'' when he made a good drive after the cameras showed up on the 17th tee during an otherwise lackluster round. In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to enjoy the golf audience, clowning for the cameras especially when he made a good shot. On the ocean, there was no solitude for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his daily jaunts in his speedboat <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> boats that escorted him, he was trailed by a five-boat flotilla of media chase vessels. That did n't seem to bother <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, except he contended at one point they were scaring off the fish. That excuse was not heard after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friends began catching fish off <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> even when the presidential hook remained bare. The chase boats generally were beyond shouting distance, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sometimes allowed them in close for a photograph. Far from seeming to have had enough of the omnipresent media coverage, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> often invited it. One day he piloted <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, filled with children and grandchildren, close to shore where a handful of reporters were engaged in other matters. He began a shouted chitchat with them across the waters. He stayed until a camera crew was positioned on the shore, then roared off into the sunshine, framing a picture perfect shot. Instead of holing up in privacy _ like <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> ranch or <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> at his seaside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was out every day. He surprised tourists and local residents by driving his boat up to dockside restaurants or gasoline wharfs. He and first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had small or large dinner parties almost every night. On Sundays, there was church, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shaking hands with the congregation afterward. On the last Sunday of his vacation he made some remarks from the pulpit and promptly went out and caught the first fish of his summer break. He had a steady stream of overnight visitors to <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point _ including the honeymooning Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> and his bride, the family of Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, and evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. Reporters who showed up in running clothes to cover his morning jogs were invited to join him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took note of all the fun he was having in a speech _ the only one of his trip _ to the local <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are doing some work, but I have confessed at the very outset that this is a pure, total vacation. And I'm not going to look busy in order to convince people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that it's something other than a vacation,'' he said.

 West German officials and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers battled cold, rainy weather and growing public resentment as they prepared Sunday for the arrival of thousands of East German refugees. Groups of curious Bavarians lingered at the outskirts of an old concrete factory in this Medieval town across the <LOCATION> Donau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, watching relief workers erect tents and feeding stations for the first of as many as 20,000 East Germans who are expected to begin arriving Monday. Five Red Cross encampments capable of taking in about 5,000 refugees were readied during the weekend in <LOCATION> Vilshofen </LOCATION> and in other small border towns in this staunchly conservative farming region in southeastern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Steady downpours and temperatures dropping to near freezing overnight hampered the work by 300 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and Bavarian state civil defense workers. Nevertheless, they met their Sunday night deadline for completing basic facilities in <LOCATION> Vilshofen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tiefenbach </PERSON> and in the border towns of <LOCATION> Freilassing </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trostberg </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Hengersberg </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Constitution regards East Germans as citizens and a generous social security system offers financial support and help in resettling, some have expressed resentment about the refugee tide. `` I would n't mind if it was just temporary, but I know it's not,'' grumbled an elderly <PERSON> Vilshofen </PERSON> man in traditional Bavarian dress of loden-green knickers, high-buttoned jacket and plumed cap `` This is a small town and there's no industry here to take them in,'' added his wife. The couple moved off when asked for their names. The reluctance of some West Germans to take in those fleeing economic stagnation or repression in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is a subject few will discuss openly. But some resent the immediate benefits afforded the new arrivals, who are entitled to the same unemployment or pension funds collected by West Germans who contributed to the system for decades. `` If it were wartime, one could understand this, but not now,'' complained <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, a local farmer selling produce in the Vilshofen public market on Saturday. `` How can all these people just simply abandon their native land? They ought to stick it out over there a little longer.'' Bavarian state Interior Minister <PERSON> Gebhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glueck </PERSON>, who visited the tent cities in <LOCATION> Vilshofen </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tiefenbach </PERSON> on Sunday, declared the expected influx of East Germans `` the largest refugee movement in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the post-war expulsions.'' Echoing a plea from federal Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> a day earlier, <PERSON> Glueck </PERSON> called on West Germans to welcome those driven from their homeland in the same spirit that allowed the assimilation of 12 million refugees in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> following the forced migrations after World War II. `` We want, and we will, handle this situation as a community,'' <PERSON> Glueck </PERSON> stated in a speech in the town of <LOCATION> Marktredwitz </LOCATION> before visiting the tent camps. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Saturday called on West Germans to show `` solidarity'' with the refugees, apparently attempting to ease public strains over the short-term burdens imposed by the newcomers. West Germans owe the refugees support `` because we have had the good fortune after the war to live in this part of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. The East Germans are expected to strain the public coffers initially. But federal labor officials have pointed out that the mostly youthful and healthy refugees crowding the government reception camps are relieving the national shortage of blue-collar workers and will probably provide an economic boost after a few months.

<HEAD>Ousted Gay Congressman Urges Congress to go Slow on Judging Personal
Lives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gay former congressman, forced out of office by a sex scandal nine years ago, came to the defense Sunday of embattled Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, saying the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> brouhaha sounds all too familiar _ and could backfire. `` It has the strange familiarity of what <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> <PERSON> Berra </PERSON> might have called ` deja vu all over again','' former Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, a Republican, wrote in a lengthy article in The Washington Post on the current controversy involving <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a Democrat, and his relationship with a male prostitute. Last month, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who in 1987 acknowledged to being gay, confirmed published reports that he had solicited and then befriended a male prostitute, allowed him to use his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apartment, and paid him $ 20,000 a year from private funds to do various chores. The prostitute, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, claimed he operated a prostitution service out of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s apartment and that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressman knew about it. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has denied any such knowledge and despite the controversy recently received signs of continuing strong support back in his home district. <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, a staunch conservative, had no such luck and was defeated in his <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> district in 1980, ending eight years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after it was revealed he was gay and had been arrested for soliciting a male prostitute. <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> wrote in the Sunday edition of the Post that he probably would disagree with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a liberal, on 95 percent of the issues facing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and likely would not vote for him. `` But I surely would not vote against him for what happened with the likes of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> wrote, chastising <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> as a `` louse'' and a `` despicable character'' who thinks nothing of turning on his `` former mentor'' for personal gain. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has said he befriended <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> because he wanted to help him recover from past mistakes including a prison record. Referring to the possibility that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may move to censure or reprimand <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, wrote: `` One thing I do know. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, both collectively and individually, is not equipped to judge <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in this matter. They may well decide to censure or reprimand him for his private _ now very public _ past conduct, but they do so at their own peril. `` This is not an easy case of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> venality. It is not a case of a congressman taking advantage of a page boy or page girl. It is a case involving consenting adults, one of whom happened to be a congressman and the other a louse. And if such private acts become the jurisdiction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the lines of the miscreants might as well begin forming on the Right and the Left.'' <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> continued, `` While the media and the public might enjoy the titillation of this incipient reign of terror, the end result will be the decimation of government.'' <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> also urged against <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> resigning, saying the matter is for the voters in his district to decide.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally on Baltic Shores to Protest Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Baltic coast residents lined up hand-in-hand on the seashore Sunday to protest pollution that they say is killing the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, journalists and activists said. `` People want to bring attention to the fact that the sea is dying,'' said <PERSON> Askolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodins </PERSON>, a translator at the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Atmoda </ORGANIZATION> He was speaking in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> republic's capital. Concern over pollution is widespread in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, which also are homes of popular movements for greater autonomy. Sunday's seaside protest was organized by the region's fledgling Greens environmental movement. Many Baltic residents believe <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> authorities have recklessly built factories and plants that pollute the environment. They have pressed for local control over polluters and economic resources. New measures beginning Jan. 1 will give <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> more control over local factories. This year's anti-pollution demonstration was overshadowed by other Baltic political events, journalists and activists said. An Estonian Radio editor said thousands took to the beaches Sunday, but the turnout was smaller than expected. `` There were so many events already, people are tired,'' said the editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, the Estonian capital. On Aug. 23, more than 1 million Baltic residents linked hands in a giant human chain stretching across the three republics. The chain was formed to protest the <LOCATION> Hitler-Stalin </LOCATION> pact that led to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of the Baltic nations.

 Chopper, a small female <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> blue-claw crab, had to endure some rough pre-race handling but it paid off as she scrambled to victory in the 42nd National Hard Crab Derby. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, 14, owner of the winner, said throughbred crabs need to be riled up to prepare for competition. His mother, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, said that was accomplished by taunting it with a stick for two hours `` to get it mangy.'' Chopper survived a preliminary heat and beat 15 finalists Saturday to top the field of 283. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> said another key was that he caught his own entry instead of using one furnished by race organizers. One race worker, however, said the real key is finding a lively, small crab. `` A lot of people bring the big ones and think they are going to win,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Crisfield </LOCATION>. `` But it's the little ones.'' Participants, who paid $ 3, were assigned a crab or could enter their own. Each crab had to finish in the top three of a preliminary heat to qualify for the final. In the Governor's Cup, `` Yellowstone Crab,'' representing the landlocked state of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, skittered over the end of a 16-foot plywood ramp ahead of crabs representing 43 other states to win the crustacean version of the run for the roses.

But they're not going overseas empty-handed. Packed among the 400 rolls of tape, 200 pucks and 57 pairs of skates the defending Stanley Cup champions are lugging along will be 100 pounds of pasta and plenty of sauce to go with it. North American-style breakfast foods, granola bars and other snacks also will be on the menu. `` A lot of people have been concerned about the food,'' said assistant general manager <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Risebrough </PERSON>. `` A lot of that stretches from earlier visits to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. We're not going over there with a self-containing idea. We're going to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and basically be Russians for 11 days.'' Except at mealtime. The pasta and sauce will be used for pregame meals and the Flames are taking their own breakfast foods due to a concern about the lack of cereals and eggs. `` We think if our players are given a similar breakfast to what they are used to here, that will help the transition,'' <PERSON> Risebrough </PERSON> said. `` As for the pregame meal, it's just because we're more comfortable with what we know.'' The Flames and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Capitals are the first two <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> teams ever to travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 If the Jewish delegation at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meetings, led by Mr. <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, then president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is `` not competent,'' who would be? And if four cardinals, including the archbishop of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, are not qualified to represent the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> side, who might be? The <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> camp is in the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> diocese. According to church law, its archbishop has full authority there. The cardinals who accompanied him belong to nations who, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, were among the chief victims of the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> barbarism. These accords were patiently and loyally negotiated over two years. The Catholic signatories promised that the financing would not fall on the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> diocese and still less on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> could only have been speaking for himself in talking of a renegotiation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. Particularly since until now he has always let it be known that Cardinal <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> was solely responsible and that the Polish Conference of Bishops, on March 9, 1989, had committed itself in turn by giving its support to the realization of this accord.

 <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>'s tony new shopping center is more Maserati than <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON>. The $ 50 million Atrium is opulent and flashy, but in a way tailored to attract sophisticated, upscale spenders. `` It's not for the K mart shopper,'' the mall magnate says. This is an all-frills enterprise, adds <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>, designed to provide his clients with the services he says they want most. The Atrium features doormen, valet parking, a concierge, a coat check, tailors and even a personal shopper for those who do n't have the time to browse. Inside the 3-acre, nine-story granite complex off busy Route 9 are such stores as <ORGANIZATION> Abercrombie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, The Limited, <ORGANIZATION> Williams-Sonoma </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>'s Secret and <PERSON> Godiva </PERSON> <PERSON> Chocolatier </PERSON>. As close as across the street are malls featuring many of the same stores as well as such modish retailers as <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>. But Atrium officials claim there's nothing else like it anywhere in the nation. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s flashy Trump Tower may have the same pink marble and brass, but try finding all the personal services, they say. `` The personalization makes the customers feel important,'' said General Manager <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Tripaldi </PERSON>. `` And if you raise a person's level of self-esteem they feel good and come back.'' The Atrium team has made a science of climbing into the psyches of prospective clients, mainly affluent residents of this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> and his partners at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 14 regional malls, came to this latest venture armed with years of experience and reams of market research. `` The demographics here are among the top in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> said. `` Price is only the third or fourth most important priority to these customers. Service is the thing.'' And not just any service. <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> says his clients want efficiency and sunny salespeople, but they also want something more, a certain je ne sais quoi. `` This market has an international flavor,'' he said. `` They have a lot of identification with European labels and ... with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> identifies with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> resident was in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area staying with friends and decided to stop by for the Atrium's grand opening. She loved the azaleas and Greek revival columns, but wondered about the dollars and sense of it all. She'd just seen a globe her family would love, but the $ 4,500 pricetag was out of this world. `` I'd rather go where you can get the best value for your money,'' she said. `` I look at all this marble and think to myself it's going to cost a lot to keep it clean.'' <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a managing partner at <ORGANIZATION> Stillerman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> market research firm, said K marts and other discount outlets are phenomenally successful because their prices are low and everyone knows it. `` In mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> valet parking is not proven to be very critical to choosing a -LRB- shopping -RRB- center,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` They want parking, restrooms, stores open late, a post office, bank machine ... Day-to-day kinds of necessities rather than luxuries.'' K mart spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kota </PERSON> said research indicated 50 percent of all American shoppers, including those from upper income groups, frequent the discount chain's 2,100 stores, which had an income last year of $ 27.3 billion. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, who describe themselves as `` serious'' shoppers, were aglow last week with the Atrium's architecture, pleasant security guards and glorious bathrooms `` It's in exquisite taste and I love the luxury.'' <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> said. `` They're making all the right moves and I can hardly wait until <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendel </PERSON>'s arrives.'' <PERSON> Bendel </PERSON>'s, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> department store, is one of several still setting up. All the Atrium's retailers were scheduled to open by February and <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> said he expected to begin turning a profit shortly thereafter. `` Developers from all over the world are coming to look at what we're doing here,'' he said. `` We've got a five-star hotel mentality.''

 A utility company employee says saving lives seems to be a fringe benefit of his job. In the past three years, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> has helped rescued a family from a burning home, revived a girl suffering from a seizure and resuscitated a man who got a 12,000-volt shock. `` It just seems natural,'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> said. `` You know what has to be done, and you go in and do it.'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, a troubleshooter for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was called to investigate a power failure in July in an electrical substation in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. He arrived 12 minutes later to find a man who seemed to be dead. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> had gotten past a barbed-wire fence and warning signs into the substation, where he was badly burned by a 12,000-volt transformer. He was hospitalized for some time, but is now out and attending physical therapy. `` He was pretty much lifeless,'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> said. `` He was n't breathing, and if he had a pulse, I sure could n't find it. <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, called rescue workers and helped them make their way around dangerous electrical equipment before fixing the power outage. `` I'm proud, and I'm glad I was the one who responded to the call,'' said <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, who teaches life-saving techniques at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Three years ago, <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> and two co-workers received citations from KG & amp; E for their rescue of a Valley Center family. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> its highest award for resuscitating 2-year-old <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> after she underwent a seizure. <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> said he loves his job because it allows him to work outdoors and meet people. Saving the occasional life, he said, is just a fringe benefit.

 In other cities, hate crimes typically decrease markedly after a racially motivated killing, authorities say. But reported hate crimes are booming in this nearly all-white city since `` skinheads'' beat an Ethiopian immigrant to death in November. Police report heightened activity by skinheads _ young, white racists who affect shaved heads and military garb _ since the killing of <PERSON> Mulugeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>. Police also blame increased violence on recruitment by racist groups targeting the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, with its small minority populations, for an Aryan homeland. `` In their minds, it's easier to get rid of blacks and Chinese and whatnot in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. From May 1988 until <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s death Nov. 12, nine racially motivated crimes were reported in <LOCATION> Multnomah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which encompasses <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and suburbs _ but 77 were reported after the killing through May 10 this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, who compiled those figures, said it was possible publicity about <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s death may have prompted more victims to report such crimes. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, who tracks skinheads for the police, said he began getting calls after the killing from teachers reporting some students had shaved their heads. `` A lot of people got caught up in the glamour of that homicide,'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said, `` street-type people looking for a cause, something to identify with.'' He also cited recruiting efforts by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, a southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> television repairman who heads the White Aryan Resistance, and <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said organized groups like WAR are n't as active in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> as `` freelance'' skinheads, who travel in groups of three to 20. Two skinheads have pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Seraw </LOCATION>'s killing and a third is awaiting trial. Authorities say the skinheads attacked <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> and two companions outside <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s home in southeast <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, clubbing him to death with a baseball bat. Skinheads were responsible for at least 46 of the 86 hate crimes reported in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> area during the year ended May 10, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. Of those incidents, 26 involved violence; most of the rest were harassment, intimidation and vandalism. `` A lot of the victimless crimes, leafleting and vandalism, those were not counted in the skinhead category. If we could n't say a skinhead group had done it, we did n't include it,'' said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. Whatever the reason for the increase in reported hate crimes, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said it defies the trend in other cities. `` In every other city in the country where skinheads are active, once an act has been committed and responded to by law enforcement, we've seen a great decline in activity or almost disappearance,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> also said racist groups `` believe primarily that the states of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, because they have relatively few minorities, are the last great region of the country that that they can take over for themselves _ and basically have declared this to be a colony for the white Aryan people.'' According to 1985 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> census statistics, whites make up more than 92 percent of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s population. More than 560,000 people live in <LOCATION> Multnomah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` We have an essentially Caucasian society here,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Mayor <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` That might possibly make someone who is interested in maintaining a white society more comfortable.'' Residents incensed by racism are coming to community meetings to learn how to spot warning signs in children who are drawn to skinhead groups. Residents are shocked `` that these people exist and live among them in their own community,'' said <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliendo </PERSON> of Southeast Uplift, a city-supported group that helps neighborhoods with crime prevention. `` We tend to think of crime as existing outside of our particular areas.'' She helped organize a rally attended by 75 people Saturday at <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where a Hispanic girl and two other teen-agers were attacked earlier last week. Six people have been arrested in that attack: three men described as skinheads, and three teen-agers. The rally provided a way for residents to `` reclaim'' the park by cleaning up graffiti, meeting their neighbors and expressing their unity, <PERSON> Caliendo </PERSON> said. `` We want the community to feel safe by banding together,'' she said.

 A car full of teen-agers who may have been fleeing a party raided by police missed a stone bridge and plunged into a shallow creek, killing six students from a rural high school, authorities said Sunday. The five boys and one girl, all believed to be between 15 and 17, may have been dead for up to 20 hours before the car was found, police said. The car went off a gravel road, missed the bridge and went down a ravine, landing in the creek partially submerged on its side. The accident was discovered by a boy walking along the road about 6 p.m. Saturday, but authorities said they were checking reports of a loud crash as early as 10 p.m. Friday. `` There's a chance they were there for some time,'' <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said. `` Where they ended up, the car was n't visible from the road.'' The victims' identities were being withheld Sunday. School Superintendent <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lark </PERSON> confirmed all they were all students at <ORGANIZATION> Wrightstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> is an incorporated town within <LOCATION> Wrightstown </LOCATION>, a rural community of 1,020 residents about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Principal <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> called the victims `` typical teen-age kids for this area'' and said he did not know where the victims had been or were going before the accident. But a group of teen-agers gathered outside <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wrightstown </LOCATION> on Sunday morning said they had known the victims from school and heard they had left a party that police raided. `` They all took off before it got raided,'' said <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechler </PERSON>, 14. Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroll </PERSON> confirmed on Sunday that police had broken up a party five or six miles from the crash site, but he did not know if the victims had been at the party. To help grieving classmates, school officials alerted a team of counselors assembled 11 months ago when five elementary-school girls died in a car-pedestrian accident in nearby <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: More U.S. Workers Killed Than in Most Other Industrial Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More workers are killed on the job in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than in most other major industrialized countries, according to a report that says the deaths cost the nation's economy at least $ 15 billion each year. Workers in this country are 36 times more likely to be killed than a Swede, and nine times more likely to be killed than a Briton, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> found in its annual Labor Day report. In addition, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> worker is more likely to be seriously injured on the job than a two-pack-a-day cigarette smoker is to contract cancer, according to the report. `` The evidence indicates that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is slipping in its efforts to reduce job injuries,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, the group's executive director, said in the report issued Saturday The Chicago-based institute is a independent, non-profit government watchdog group devoted to job safety issues. More muscle and money are needed from the government and the private sector `` before it can be concluded that Americans are on the road to safer work,'' according to the report. But it noted that some encouraging signs from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> indicate policy may be shifting in the worker's favor. According to the group's report: _ More than 10,000 men and women die each year from on-the-job injuries _ Another 70,000 workers become permanently disabled each year as a result of job-related conditions _ One out of 11 workers will be killed or seriously injured at work The problem is increasing, despite factors such as an aging _ and theoretically more experienced _ workforce and new technology that should reduce or eliminate risk of injury, the institute said. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> statistics show that in 1987, 8.3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers per 100 fulltime employees were injured on the job, up from 7.6 in 1983. In 1986, the nation had 10,700 occupational fatalities. The figure would have been just 300 if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>'s fatality rate were equal to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s, and 6,838 if it were equal to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s, the report said. But it said, there are `` signs of promise.'' They include <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s pledge to make occupational safety and health a high priority, and recent action by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. For example, the group noted that on July 27, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> imposed a $ 2.72 million fine and sought a court injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Friction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for alleged failure to protect workers from asbestos exposure. The company was accused of violating `` almost every provision of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s asbestos standard in the process of threatening the health and even the lives of many of its workers,'' the report said. The report also cited a $ 2 million proposed penalty Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> issued July 7 against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` for failing to live up to its November 1987 agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> to accurately record injuries and illnesses.'' ` While the final chapter of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s leadership is far from written, the opening pages provide <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s workers with the most encouraging signs of safe work that they have had in several years,'' the report concludes.

<HEAD>Israel Broadens Orders on Shooting Masked Palestinians</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with death of second Israeli soldier,
Amman denying Arab crossed from Jordan; No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops will be able to use live ammunition `` day or night'' to stop masked Palestinian suspects resisting arrest in the occupied territories, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Sunday. Late Sunday, a second Israeli soldier died of wounds received in a gun battle with an alleged infiltrator from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> Saturday, an army spokesman said. The army said the 27-year-old soldier died from a bullet wound in the head. His death came hours after the burial of a 25-year-old soldier who was also killed in the clash. The Palestinian, who was not identified, was slain by Israeli forces. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, a senior official said Sunday that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has found no evidence the guerrilla had crossed from Jordanian territory. The strengthened security measure is directed at Arab youth who enforce orders from the underground leaders of the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising. Usually wearing masks and operating at night, they sometimes attack and kill other Arabs suspected of collaborating with the Israeli occupation. A Palestinian activist said the order will lead to more Palestinian being shot. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said that in the past, soldiers were restricted to using plastic bullets against the suspects after they refused to stop on order and after a warning shot was fired. But other sources said on condition of anonymity that firing live ammunition at masked suspects had been allowed at night. In his announcement on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the new measure was needed to crack down on Palestinian militants who are terrorizing the population. He spoke after Palestinian enforcers killed one suspected collaborator and wounded another in an attack with knives and hatchets. An Arab journalist reported seeing the mutilated body of 25-year-old <PERSON> Riyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> on a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> street Sunday. Awaiting medical treatment next to the body was 18-year-old <PERSON> Raed </PERSON> <PERSON> Majed </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. He had been beaten and stabbed. A crowd gathered as the body was put into an ambulance and shouted `` death to collaborators!'' Other witnesses said some passers-by spit and threw tomatoes. Masked Palestinians are blamed for most of the 105 Arabs killed by other Arabs during the uprising. At least 557 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis. `` Israeli Defense Forces will receive in the next few days permission to use live fire to stop suspects who are wearing masks,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. He said they would be allowed to do so `` day or night.'' <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON>, an elementary school principal in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and a prominent activist, predicted the new orders would lead to more Palestinians being shot by soldiers and `` more enmity.'' `` This is a serious crackdown on the intefadeh,'' he said, using the Arab word for `` uprising.'' `` Political and military leaders in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> talk about a political solution for the intefadeh, but in practice what they do contradicts what they say.'' In other comments on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also warned <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not tolerate attacks on its territory from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. He spoke after the clash between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla near the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. On March 17, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was also killed, and the two attackers fled back into <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> must find a way to prevent fire or infiltration from its border if it wants ... to have neighborly relations with us,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, a high government official denied the Palestinian entered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` We have no proof that a civilian crossed the cease-fire line,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. `` Usually when someone crosses, we could figure it out. Either he crosses a certain fence or sometimes -LRB- leaves -RRB- a footprint ... There's nothing.'' In another development, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sources estimated 20,000 Palestinians crossed into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to work Sunday using new Israeli-issued identity cards. Normally, nearly 50,000 go to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Leaders of the Palestinian uprising have tried to keep residents from using the cards.

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiku </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> stepped out of high-tech <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and back in time Sunday, touring the thatched huts of Plimoth Plantation and a replica of the Mayflower. The Prime Minister and his wife, <PERSON> Sachiyo </PERSON>, joined a group of singers dressed as Pilgrims in a verse of the 100th Psalm, rode an ox cart and sampled an old-fashioned spice loaf during a visit to a reproduction of a 17th century <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> colony in this coastal community. In a brief news conference, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, harked back to his first visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 27 years ago, when he was first elected to the Japanese Parliament. `` Simply, my impression was that this is a huge, vast country,'' he said through a translator. Other visitors to Plimoth Plantation snapped photos and waved as the Prime Minister wound through the dirt streets of the early colonial town. Earlier in the day, the prime minister visited <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> where he toured the Asiatic, Impressionist and Copley galleries. At one point on the tour a member of his entourage gave <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> a $ 1 bill, which the prime minister held up to compare to a portrait of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. At <LOCATION> Fenway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and his entourage were greated at a side gate by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> general manager <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> and dined with the club's owner, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Yawkey </PERSON>, in <ORGANIZATION> Fenway </ORGANIZATION>'s 600 club. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and his wife received a warm welcome from the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> fans as he took off his suit coat and donned a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> cap to throw up the ceremonial first pitch to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> catcher <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedman </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> returned upstairs to the club's private box to watch the game with <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>. The prime minister's trip comes soon after his ascension to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s top political post and is designed, in part, to lend legitimacy to his new administration. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was named prime minister last month after his predecessors in the ruling party suffered a series of political and sex scandals. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, who served twice as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s educational minister, also visited <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and received a souvenir T-shirt at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 About 100 people shouting `` Down with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>!'' gathered outside a church Sunday, and opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> urged them to peacefully resist the new civilian government installed by the general. `` We are going to dedicate ourselves to resisting this military dictatorship of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the end,'' said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who international observers said won the May 7 elections in a landslide. The government annulled that election. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, considered to be controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, named <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s comptroller, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Poveda </PERSON>, as president. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> faced supporters outside the Christ the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> after attending Mass with his running mates in the election, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said the opposition to the government would continue, but `` this resistance is going to be peaceful,'' he said. `` With prayer, God is not ever going to abandon the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people and soon, very soon, he will give us justice and freedom,'' Supporters chanted `` Down with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>!'' and `` You feel it, you feel it, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> is the president!'' The meeting was the first public gathering by the opposition since <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 50, a high school friend of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was sworn as provisional president on Friday. The opposition refused to form a junta with the civilian government and the military. A day before the term of acting president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> expired, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was picked to be president. The provisional government is to appoint a 41-member legislative commission to replace the assembly, whose term also expired Friday. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> have said the holding of new elections will depend on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lifts economic sanctions imposed to pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frozen about $ 300 million in Panamanian assets and ha imposed trade sanctions that include a ban on any payments to the Panamanian government. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the American government is compiling a list of companies and individuals associated with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and may block them from doing business with Americans. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began urging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down after he was indicted by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries in February 1988 on charges of drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the charges.

 Defrocked <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is undergoing a battery of tests to determine whether he can stand trial, and will be examined by the same psychiatrist who evaluated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an official said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud and conspiracy trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> was halted Thursday when Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> ordered him sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>, about 30 miles northwest of here, to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. Psychiatrists are giving <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> examinations such as ink-blot and personality tests, said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON>, executive assistant to the warden. `` There's a standard battery of tests done in all these competency referrals,'' he said Saturday. Dr. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>'s chief of psychiatric services, who also evaluated presidential assailant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, will lead the team making the evaluation, <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who attempted to assassinate President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981 and severely wounded his press secretary, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, was found innocent by reason of insanity. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> professor who has studied televangelism and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, over the past decade said Sunday that no matter what the psychiatrists find, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has been living in his own world. `` Here's a man who most of the time lives in a fantasy world that he and his wife and his close associates have created,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>, author of `` Prime Time Preachers'' and `` Televangelism, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> and Politics.'' He said they were pushed into the limelight through a combination of hard work and luck, `` and then capitalized, exploited and took advantage of it, and the dream got bigger and bigger and bigger.'' `` I think that he just reached the breaking point,'' <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` But I do n't see it as catastrophic, and I do n't see it as spelling mental illness.'' He cited the pressures of the conviction in July of former aides and brothers <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, the sentencing last month of his former top deputy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, and the collapse Wednesday of prosecution witness <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> from dehydration caused by the flu. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and faces 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines.

<HEAD>Couple Returns Home After Eight-Year Sail Around The World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caren </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> were a romantic young couple when they sank their life savings into a homemade fiberglass sailboat for a voyage around the world. More than eight years later _ or 55 countries, 58,000 miles, and two children later _ the Suttons sailed under the Golden Gate to return home on Saturday. `` To be honest, it's a lot of work _ and a lot of fun,'' <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` Anybody can do it. Just go for it.'' The couple and their two daughters born during the family's odyssey were welcomed at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> by dozens of family and friends and a proclamation of welcome from the city The Suttons, sailing novices who first shared the dream of traveling around the world while high school sweethearts, started building their 43-foot sailing yawl, the <LOCATION> Marinka </LOCATION>, 14 years ago. The couple sold their possessions and sailed out beyond the Golden Gate in March 1981. Three days before their scheduled departure, <PERSON> Caren </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> learned she was pregnant. `` She was very nervous about that. They had to reconsider the trip. They thought about it for a long time and decided to go,'' said her mother, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caren </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, after a first leg of the voyage that gave new meaning to the term morning sickness, gave birth to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, now 7, in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, now 5, was born in <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION>. `` It was my husband's dream and I just went along with it,'' <PERSON> Caren </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` He did everything, from navigating to operating the radio. ... I take orders very well, cook and take care of the children.'' But her husband said his wife underestimated her role and called her a `` trouper.'' The family weathered hurricanes and visited such lands as <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. Not all was idyllic, however: The Marinka survived eight storms at sea, including four hurricanes in 1983. Throughout the years, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, visited their children and grandchildren in various ports around the world and kept in constant touch with them, often by ham radio. While happy he lived his lifelong dream, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> was glad to be home. `` These are our freinds and family,'' he said. `` This is the best. To be back from it all is great.'' The Suttons also are looking forward to _ for them _ a novel way of life. `` The biggest adventure of all I can think of now is buying a house, mowing the lawn and watching the kids grow _ doing everything everybody else is doing, and taking a hot shower every day,'' <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Doesn't Want Human Rights Groups In Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said Sunday he would not allow international human rights groups into <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to investigate alleged rights abuses. Also Sunday, an Information Department statement said 24 people were killed over the weekend by Sinhalese radicals from the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultranationalist guerrilla group seeking to overthrow the government The victims included five women relatives of security force personnel, 12 civilians, five soldiers, a doctor and a postal official, the statement said. It gave no further details. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s declaration regarding human rights came after he met with a six-member opposition group called the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentarians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fundamental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. The group urged the president to safeguard human rights, the statement said. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said the government was not prepared to permit international human rights groups, including <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, to visit the country. He told opposition leaders that `` human rights is not the preserve of one party or group,'' according to the statement. Opposition politicians and human rights groups have accused the military and pro-government vigilante groups of killing hundreds of civilians suspected of sympathizing with Sinhalese radicals. At least 1,222 people have been killed since June 20, when <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> imposed a state of emergency and gave security forces special powers. In mid-August, the London-based human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the Sri Lankan government to stem what it called the rising tide of killings, torture, disappearances and detentions perpetrated by its forces. The government denies the charges and says Sinhalese extremists are responsible for most of the 5,000 killings reported since the front began its campaign two years ago. The front claims the government made too many concessions to Tamil secessionists in an India-brokered peace accord of June, 1987. It also protests the presence of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping soldiers, deployed in the northeast under the accord to disarm Tamil militants. The front, in letters sent to <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> newspapers Sunday, accused the government of killing more than 5,000 people in the last two years. The letters, signed by the group's leader, <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, called upon opposition political parties to unite, saying, `` people know who is doing the killings and what is taking place in the country.'' The statement was the front's first known appeal to political parties. It also warned that people must be `` prepared to make sacrifices to save their motherland,'' indicating they might enforce another strike after last week's successful work stoppage. Sri Lankan businessmen say a series of radical-enforced strikes have crippled the country's economy. The country's ethnic troubles surfaced in 1983 when the Tamil minority began demanding a separate nation in the northeast. The armed insurrection has claimed 11,000 lives, according to government figures. The Tamil community, which comprises 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, allege discrimination by the majority Sinhalese in jobs and education. Sinhalese are mostly Buddhists and Tamils are mostly Hindus.

 A scuba diver was attacked by a shark off <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Sunday and hospitalized in stable condition with bite wounds to his left forearm and right hand, authorities said. The man was filming sharks and was outside a shark cage when he was attacked by a blue shark, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> said. The name of the 46-year-old man was withheld pending notification of relatives. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said the man was attacked while diving 10 miles northwest of the island, about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and was airlifted from a diving vessel to <ORGANIZATION> Harbor-UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>. The diver was in stable condition, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiyuna </PERSON> said, refusing to provide any details. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official who refused to give his name said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> received an emergency call from the dive boat about 11 a.m. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON>, operations manager of the <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> where the 60-foot boat is based, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials apparently talked the boat's crew by radio into stanching the diver's blood loss. `` I heard that they could not stop the bleeding and had to use a tourniquet,'' <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> said the vessel, The Scuba Lover, frequently went on shark-observing expeditions and had a shark cage on board this trip. `` Normally, The Scuba Lover runs what they call Blue Sharks Expeditions. It's a beautiful shark but not usually dangerous,'' <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> said the attack was `` very uncommon'' for the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. He had no details on why the diver was outside the cage. In January, a young couple kayaking off <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> were apparently killed by a marauding shark, possibly a great white. Sailors found the shark-mauled body of <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON>, 24, floating six miles off <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Her companion, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, 24, was never found. Such attacks are extremely rare in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The last fatal attack in the state was in September 1984 when an abalone diver was mauled 40 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Only six fatal shark attacks were reported between 1926 and 1984 and in five of those deaths the attack was blamed on a great white shark.

 A short, sharp earthquake jolted the wine country about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Sunday but caused no damage or injuries, authorities said. The temblor, which occurred at 8:24 a.m., measured 3.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered 7 miles east of here and 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Healdsburg </LOCATION>, according to the the National Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. It occurred in the geothermal fields known as The Geysers. Dozens of <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents called local authorities to report the quake. The open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to 6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of 6.0 can cause serious damage.

 The Gulf coast state of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> voted for state legislators Sunday, and opposition parties said their representatives were refused access to polls and registration lists were manipulated. One poll watcher was attacked with a machete by a member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman for the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said. The spokesman, <PERSON> Wilhem </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, said the incident occurred when a party representative went to a precinct in a small town outside <LOCATION> Misantla </LOCATION>, 70 miles northwest of the port of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>. The seriousness of his injuries was not known, he said. `` There were certain irregularities of all types. You know the kind, they're normal by now,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a state legislator for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's going to be fraud again.'' Incidents, including expulsion of poll watchers, were most frequent in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tuxtla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orizaba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Coatzacoalcos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Misantla </LOCATION>, he said. By law, opposition parties are allowed to have representatives at polling places, but they frequently complain of accreditation problems. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said opposition monitors were not allowed in any of the 10 communities near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tuxtla </LOCATION>. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Leftist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said its members were pared from voter registration lists and voter credentials were distributed with no control. Electoral commission president <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedroza </PERSON> asked for proof of violations. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who took office on Dec. 1, has pledged elections will be clean and opposition victories will be recognized. The governing party accepted the first gubernatorial loss in its 60-year history on July 2, when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> candidate won in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But accusations continue that it cheated the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> out of legislative victories the same day in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state. Results in several municipal elections in the southern state of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION> in August also were disputed. Transparent ballot boxes were used in <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> Sunday for the first time. About 3 million of the state's 6.3 million people were eligible to vote. Official results were expected in a week. The legislature was being increased from 31 to 40 seats, 24 to be filled by direct election and 16 allotted to minority parties according to the percentage of the vote they receive. The governing party currently holds 23 seats.

He described the Western hostages held by extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as `` innocent victims due to the intervention of their respective governments'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was asked about the possible release of the hostages and he said if he could help `` I would never delay'' efforts. But he then added, `` If we knew who kidnapped them we could talk to'' the abductors. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, wearing a silk robe, black cape and white turban, spoke through an interpreter at the news conference that began at 11 p.m. He said, `` We do not recognize any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in any of the respective -LRB- <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> -RRB- countries,'' and that also was true of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and all other Western nations. Eight Americans are among 16 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s tent was erected in a park in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dedinje </LOCATION> suburb. <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON>, in an interview published Saturday, said streamlining the non-aligned movement is the key issue of the four-day conference. His foreign minister, <PERSON> Budimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON>, said the movement must modernize its political activities. For the first time, the movement of leftist, centrist and conservative leaders is scheduled to deal with human rights. After two days of talks, foreign ministers from member countries early Sunday adopted a main conference document for consideration by the summit. The draft refers to the `` struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, apartheid and all forms of domination.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> failed to have included in the document a condemnation of Zionism.

<HEAD>FDIC Looks to Sell its Share of the Cowboys</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 FORT WORTH _ The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> are living up to their billing as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s team'' _ at least 12 percent of the club is. A chunk of the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> franchise has fallen into the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and officials are looking for a buyer, according to a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> newspaper. The government gained a stake in the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> helped <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> take over <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in July 1988. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> took control of the shares after <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> Camp and J.L. <PERSON> Huffines </PERSON>, all of whom were limited partners in the franchise, encountered financial problems in their real estate businesses. The bank foreclosed and collected the shares, which were pledged as collateral on loans. After the takeover, the bank assumed the name <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> share sale is being handled as part of the bank's agreement to manage the $ 5 billion asset pool for the government. `` We're certainly looking for a bidder, bank spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are actively looking for a buyer.'' Although the sale price <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> is seeking is uncertain, sources say the 12 percent share is worth about $ 7.2 million, the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> newspaper reported. That figure is based on H.R. `` Bum'' Bright's sale of his 40 percent general parternship of the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who paid $ 60 million this year to gain controlling interest of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> team. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> says he controls a 56 percent holding, with 51 percent in his name and five percent in the name of associate <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>. The limited partners are <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>, with 27 percent; <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, with five percent; and the government, with 12 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> has to approve any new partner before the government can complete a sale. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has told the Star-Telegram that he has `` no plans at this time'' to acquire the government's stake. Other shareholders said they plan to keep their shares because investing in the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> is a good investment. `` With new TV rights, a big gate and new radio contract, the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> could be profitable,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Veatch </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> operations, who handled Bright's sale of the team to <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> and former leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> conducted a flurry of campagining on the eve of the nation's general elections Monday. All campaigning, including television and radio commercials, officially ended at midnight Sunday _ seven hours before the polls open for 11 hours. Voters will cast ballots for the 28 seats in the lower house of the legislature and the party that wins the most seats will name the prime minister. Terms of office are for five years. <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said during the campaign that his administration brought economic recovery to <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> and efficient government. Price, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was defeated by <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> in the 1984 election. His campaign slogan was `` Belizeans first,'' and he accused <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> of giving too much to foreigners to gain investments and tourism. Price was the top Belizean official when the country was a self-governing British colony before it became independent in 1981. No public opinion polls were taken but political observers said they belived <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> held a slight edge. His party holds 21 seats in the lower house and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the remaining seven. Elections officials say 82,589 of the country's 160,000 residents are eligible to vote. Initial results are expected about midnight Monday. In his criticism of alleged foreign influence, Price attacked a program that allows foreigners to purchase $ 25,000 bonds and then apply for citizenship. If the applicants do n't qualify for citizenship they can redeem the bonds but if they do they can become citizens and the bond is to be repaid without interest in 10 years. The plan is aimed mainly at residents of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony that is to revert to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. Many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents are expected to flee the colony rather than accept control by communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> has said that during the past five years prices for sugar, fruits and other major exports have been stable and foreign investments and tourism have doubled. <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> has a bicameral legislature with an elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and appointed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The house determines which party will form a new government. <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, smaller than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, is on the Central American mainland but maintains closer cultural ties with other English-speaking former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> colonies in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> than with its Spanish-speaking neighbors. Neighboring <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> maintains a territorial claim against <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, formerly British <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and British troops are stationed in the country in case of hostilities with <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Drug-related killings of police officers hit a record high in 1988, but the rate of officer deaths to narcotics enforcement remains surprisingly low, a private study concludes. According to the study issued Sunday by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, 14 officers were killed in drug enforcement activities such as raids, arrests and serving warrants, including one who was assassinated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. By contrast, killings of police officers have averaged seven a year since 1972, when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began publishing narratives on how police officers died in the line of duty. By another measure, the proportion of all police murders attributable to drugs has risen from 6 percent in 1985 to 18 percent in 1988, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who also heads the institute, said part of the reason for the increase is the increased drug enforcement activity. Estimated drug arrests have set a record each year since reaching 708,000 in 1984, rising to 1.1 million in 1988, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. The numbers of police murders per drug arrest rose from .71 to 100,000 in 1984 to 1.22 per 100,000 in 1988. The all-time record rate of drug arrest-related police killings was in 1976, when 1.96 officers died per 100,000 arrests, followed by 1980 when there were 1.89 police killings for every 100,000 drug arrests. `` While the risk of death per arrest is still not as high as in the record years of 1976 and 1980, this trend is still an ominous one,'' the study said. `` The record levels of drug enforcement, combined with rising risk levels per arrest, suggest that the total murders of police in drug enforcement will increase in future years.'' Putting the risk in perspective, the report noted that officers who make two drug arrests a day, 220 days a year, for 25 years will make only 5,500 drug arrests. `` Career drug arrests may total, on average, less than 100 for the typical officer,'' it said. `` At these levels of drug enforcement activity, odds of one death per 100,000 drug arrests are pretty safe bets.'' Of the killings since 1972, 33 percent happened during undercover `` buy and bust'' operations, 32 percent while serving warrants or conducting raids, and 5 percent were `` ambushed'' during surveillance or killed to prevent their testimony. Referring to the ambush killings, the report said: `` These cases are a mere handful compared to the 220 judges and other court officials slain in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, apparently by drug dealers, since 1981. But it is striking that four out of six of these <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases occurred in the period from 1985 through 1988.'' The study did not count killings outside drug enforcement even if the killer was under the influence of drugs, was a known or past drug dealer or in possession of drugs. Additionally, the report did not mention non-fatal injuries to officers.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> on Sunday blasted the Republican presidential administrations of the 1980s for what they called a hostile attitude toward labor. `` The 1980s was a decade of great symbolism over substance,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a day-long rally of about 10,000 people in southwestern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where coal miners have been striking the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> since early April. Many people in the crowd wore camouflage, which has become the unofficial uniform of striking miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` During the past 10 years, political leaders such as President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have used the American flag to pull the wool over our eyes,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the cheering crowd. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of defending an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag that is `` made in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'' but not fighting forU. textile workers. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stands for solidarity with workers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but not in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has become an instrument for strike-breaking under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administrations. `` The 1980s were a shameful, shameful period in our history,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. Multi-national corporations have intimidated workers into submission in recent years, often by moving their plants abroad, he said. The labor movement was unable to fight back because it was divided, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. When air traffic controllers went on strike in 1981, `` they fought alone,'' and large corporations saw that as a sign of weakness in the labor movement, he said. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the 1990s will be better times for the labor movement. `` Never again will working people stand alone in a struggle which threatens their well being.''

 Two jets from the Snowbirds aerobatic team crashed into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> during an air show Sunday after apparently striking each other, authorities said. One pilot was feared dead and the other parachuted to safety. Divers searched Sunday night for Capt. <PERSON> Shayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Antaya </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, who went down with his plane and was feared dead. Maj. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, the 36-year-old commander of the Canadian Forces precision flying team, safely ejected and was treated briefly at the hospital for facial cuts and leg burns before being released. Witnesses along the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> waterfront reported <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>'s parachute opened just before a there was a loud explosion and one plane plunged into the lake within a few hundreds yard of the shore under clear skies At a news conference Sunday night, Col. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON> said <PERSON> Antaya </PERSON>'s wife, mother, brother and sister were among thousands of people watching the show from the shore. `` There were four aircraft heading down and three heading up,'' said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bramalea </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, who watched the accident through binoculars. `` It looked like one wingtip hit the other one's tail, belly to belly `` The one going down went straight into the lake. The other one attempted to gain altitude and began to swerve off to the right before it exploded. We saw the pilot eject and the parachute drop. No pilot came out of the other one.'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, one of thousands of horrified onlookers, said, `` The one aircraft just literally disappeared into a complete ball of flame and black smoke. `` They were flying in a fairly close formation, operating away from the main team.'' The accident occurred about 1:45 p.m. on the second day of a three-day air show at the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhibition </ORGANIZATION> held along the waterfront west ot downtown. The pilots were performing a stunt called an upward-downward bomb burst. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s nine-member military stunt team performs at more than 60 air shows throughout <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> each year. Col. <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON> said the Snowbirds `` are filled with a sense of loss'' and had suspended future shows. Team members fly the CT-114 Tutor, a single-engine jet trainer used by the military as its basic training aircraft. The plane is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Canadair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and has a maximum speed of nearly 500 mph.

 Former President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> arrived here from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sunday to stand trial on corruption and perjury charges. The trial was suspended in July when <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>, 63, was allowed to travel to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to accompany his wife, <PERSON> Asela </PERSON> <PERSON> Mera </PERSON>, hospitalized for a broken ankle suffered during a fall in a stairwell. `` I've come to continue with the trial which began April 19 and demonstrate my innocence,'' <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> said after arriving. He faces charges of corruption and perjury stemming from his alleged sale to the army of millions of dollars worth of vehicles, clothing and other equipment at inflated prices during his term in office which ended in 1986. Shortly after he left office, <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, for heart treatment and was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison and fined $ 16.4 million. He returned to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in November 1988 to appeal the sentence and was immediately jailed. He was freed on bail July 5 to accompany his wife to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 Thousands of angry soccer fans waiving Chilean flags rallied before the Brazilian Embassy Sunday to protest a firecracker attack on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s goalie during a World Cup qualifying match in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. About 4,000 demonstrators chanted `` <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>!'' and `` Down with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>!'' and one protester burned a Brazilian flag, reporters said. Traffic was halted along the eight-lane boulevard in front of the embassy as police blocked off the building. The three-hour protest was mostly peaceful and there were no immediate reports of arrests, police said. Demonstrators, however, broke windows in some buildings near the embassy, police said. Scattered protests were reported elsewhere in the city.

This spring <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, 38, learned she was pregnant. On May 5, two months into the pregnancy, they learned that the fetus' heart had stopped beating. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 63, has six sons by a previous marriage. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said his loss can not compare to the trials faced by parents who lose a child after years of suffering, but now he has new understanding of their plight. `` I thought I knew what I was talking about,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, recalling decades of relating to parents whose children die of muscular dystrophy. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> also said he was `` shocked and saddened'' by the death last week of the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Conner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> who was to appear on the telethon to describe his battle with one of the diseases <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to cure. <PERSON> O'Conner </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> Thursday and was hospitalized later in the day after suffering breathing problems. He died Friday of respiratory complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease because it took the life of the famed baseball player. A film chronicling <PERSON> O'Conner </PERSON>'s battle with the disease was to be shown on the telethon.

 A passenger on a commuter flight suffered a minor gunshot wound to the head Sunday when his plane was fired upon while landing at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale-Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, authorities said. The 1:40 p.m. EDT shooting occurred as the twin-engine, turboprop plane arriving from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> came in on final approach. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> Flight 4343 was carrying 16 passengers and three crew members, airport officials said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Dove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he heard a popping noise before feeling a bump on his head, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leljedal </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` He first thought something had fallen and struck him, but he saw nothing,'' the spokesman said. `` When <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> touched his head with his hand, he found that he was bleeding.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he was treated for a superficial scalp wound and released, <PERSON> Leljedal </PERSON> said.

 A group of 488 Kurdish refugees left their camp in this southeastern province to return to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> voluntarily, the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Sunday. The agency quoted Mus Governor <PERSON> Adil </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazar </PERSON> as saying the group left the camp in three trucks and five buses Saturday night and would leave the country through the Habur border gate. A group of 380 Kurdish refugees returned to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last month. The Kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and small enclaves of 500,000 each in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Iraqi government has been accused of forcibly evacuating thousands of Kurds from their homes, razing towns in the northern Kurdish homeland and resettling Kurds in the south of the country. The government says the resettlement is to improve life for the impoverished Kurds. Last year, Iraqis dropped poison gas on the Kurdish town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, killing an estimated 4,000 civilians. The Kurds claim thousands more were killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last fall. Following the attacks by the Iraqi army, about 60,000 Kurds fled to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Some have since gone to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and a few thousand have returned to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. About 40,000 remain in tent camps and crowded apartment houses in southeast <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

At the state fair in <LOCATION> Hopkinton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, a pickup truck performing in a stunt act crashed through a fence and hit a fried dough stand shortly after 5 p.m., scattering injured people on the ground before thousands of spectators. `` I heard the crash, I looked up and, oh, people were flying all over the place,'' concessionaire <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. State police Lt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said the only fatality was the 62-year-old truck driver from <LOCATION> Mifflintown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and they were investigating the possibility that he suffered a medical problem before the crash. <LOCATION> Hopkinton </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Migdal </PERSON> said six of the 23 injured were admitted to <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, two to the intensive care unit. Among the injured were four children and four teen-agers, a hospital spokeswoman said. `` The majority of injuries that I saw appeared to be very serious,'' <PERSON> Migdal </PERSON> said.

 A commercial helicopter collided with a small plane above a rural subdivision Sunday night, killing all three people aboard both aircraft and scattering debris over the neighborhood, authorities said.

 Thousands of young people here for a Labor Day weekend fraternity gathering went on a rampage down the main thoroughfare of this resort city early Sunday, firing shots and looting more than 100 stores. After a tense but uneventful day in which store owners cleaned up gutted storefronts, police turned out at mid-evening in riot gear and cleared the streets, arresting dozens more young people during a 35-minute sweep. Two men were wounded by gunshots in the earlier confrontation with police, and at least two others were injured, authorities said. City officials say some of the estimated 100,000 young people who clogged the resort strip looted more than 100 stores along <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the city's main beachfront thoroughfare. Police said 160 people were arrested and brought into the station between Friday evening and early Sunday evening, and 395 others had been issued citations for various offenses. They did not have a breakdown of the kinds of arrests. At the request of city officials, Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> dispatched a military police detachment from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and state police troopers to the area. `` It is a local law enforcement situation and it is being managed by city officials and state police officials who are on the scene,'' said <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' press secretary, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON>. She said <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> `` is receiving state police briefings and reports on _ I do n't know if its an hourly basis _ but he's received several reports today.'' At 8 p.m. Sunday, city officials closed the downtown beach area to incoming traffic. State and local police patrolled the area on foot and by helicopter. Several people threw bottles at state troopers, who began making arrests, and onlookers taunted National Guardsmen who marched through city streets, armed with batons and assault rifles. Shortly after 9:30 p.m., about 75 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police officers formed a wedge and began moving south on <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, which runs parallel to the oceanfront one block away. The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> officers were followed by a state police armored truck, which announced over a public address system that the approximately 350 young people in the street represented an unlawful assembly. Officers were pelted with bottles as they walked along the street and made arrests. Several officers who went into an adjoining motel parking lot to arrest someone were showered by bottles thrown from a balcony above. By 10:05, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> was empty except for several hundred police officers. Dozens were arrested during the course of the 35-minute sweep. The initial disturbances began around 2 a.m. and stretched along a 30-block section of the street, police said. A witness said police had attempted to disperse groups of fraternity students, most from predominantly black colleges along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, who were showing off dance steps on <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. At one point in the fracas, police lobbed a smoke bomb into a crowd of people. `` It's been like we're being singled out because we are young and black,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. City officials were considering imposing a curfew to prevent further violence. In addition, the city has asked state officials to suspend the sale of alcohol in the city until Tuesday. `` I can assure you that this type of behavior is not condoned and will not be tolerated now or in the future,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Meyera </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberndorf </PERSON>. She declined to answer questions, saying she did not have details. The majority of the mob were college students in town for the annual Labor Day weekend Greekfest for members of fraternities and sororities, authorities said. During last year's Greekfest, police were forced to clear smaller groups of young people from the street. Some witnesses said police overreacted to the students' activities `` They've been trying to regulate things that do n't need regulating,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who said he watched the confrontation begin from his motel balcony. `` Last year, everything was real nice. There was no violence ... but this year the place was jammed with police and they were hassling people,'' he said. They said police formed a `` V'' with six to eight mounted officers backed by police in riot gear, and began moving south down <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> pushing students off the street and sidewalks with clubs. Several witnesses said they saw tear gas or a smoke bomb fired to disperse the crowd. City officials first said neither was used. Later, they said a smoke bomb was fired into the crowd to indicate wind direction should tear gas be necessary. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the city, said tear gas was not used, nor were any shots fired by police. She said police were unsure what set off the incident. By the time order was restored Sunday morning along the beachfront avenue of hotels and shops, merchants said it looked chaotic. `` I did n't know these kinds of things existed,'' said <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> whose <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> shop was spared. A jewelry story next door was looted, its display cases left shattered on the sidewalk. Merchants and city crews cleaned up the damage Sunday under the eyes of flak-jacketed MPs armed with assault rifles. By 6 p.m., the National Guardsmen were off the street and the sidewalks were crowded with visitors. Police in riot gear were on most street corners. `` We just hope we can make it through tonight,'' said <PERSON> Bobbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON> of Logo Lil's, a T-shirt shop. Though her shop was not damaged, Ms. <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON> did not plan to reopen this weekend. `` We tried to welcome these people. We'd been hearing rumors all week that something was going to happen,'' she said. <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Badinno </PERSON> stood in the ruins of a clothing store. Of the 7,000 garments in the store, 100 were left about the floor. The only things left on the shelves were signs warning that shoplifters would be prosecuted. `` It's awful. ... We do n't even have our cash register,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> said. Police closed off <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> through most of Sunday. Merchants said they were losing business in what is generally the best weekend of the year for resort merchants. Traditionally, the Labor Day weekend is the grand finale of the summer beachgoing season. `` It's a major loss,'' Ms. <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON> said. `` We would have made about $ 3,000. Now it's down to zero.'' <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanz </PERSON>, front desk manager at the <LOCATION> Kona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motel </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, said Sunday morning that authorities were not allowing guests to leave the motel unless they were checking out to go home. `` This is a heck of a way to end the season,'' she said. A nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> Sentara-Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be identified, said shooting victim <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Forestville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was in stable condition. The other wounded man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Roselle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was listed in fair condition at <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Authorities said two other people were also injured, but it was not clear if those injuries were related to the riot. One man was in critical condition with ijuries suffered when he fell from the fourth floor of a hotel, while another was critically injured in a car accident near the area where the riot occurred. In 1986, a crowd of unruly college and high school students on spring break rampaged through <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, pelting police with rocks and bottles. Beer-drinking youths on the crowded main boulevard of the desert resort dumped water into passing cars, and ripped bathing suit tops off of several young women during the melee, which lasted several hours. Since then, police have called in reinforcements to monitor spring break crowds and make hundreds of arrests for relatively minor offenses such as public drunkenness, but there has been no repeat of the violence.

<TEXT>
 A gunman disabled an automatic bank machine, waited for repair workers to arrive, held them up and made off with $ 150,000 from the machine, police said Sunday. Police are still searching for the robber, who forced two <ORGANIZATION> BayBank </ORGANIZATION> workers to open the back of a money machine, then looted it of cash. `` He tied them up and cleaned out the machine,'' said Police Lt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjostedt </PERSON>. Investigators are studying photo tapes taken during transactions before Saturday's robbery, he said. <PERSON> Sjostedt </PERSON> said police believe the money machine was broken intentionally by the thief in order to bring repair workers. A faulty machine activates a signal in the bank's central system. The employees were returning to their car around midnight when the gunman wearing a stocking mask and gloves pointed a revolver at them and herded them back to the machine in a shopping plaza. The thief escaped in a car belonging to one of the bank workers, but it was found abandoned on Route 3.
